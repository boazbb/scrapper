I love it.. I had trouble with it at first trying toast because the booklet is not clean on what temp. to put it on for toast. I didn't think you had to put it on a temperature.. I mean why right?  but my husband said it should be all the way up for the temperature on toast and it worked. the booklet doesnt give alot of info for me.  Kind of trial and error trying to figure it out. But I think I got it now!  In years past they use to have a hook from the rack that attached to the door remember that? I mean some toaster ovens and it was perfect. I haven't been able to find that since.  I don't know why they did away with that because when you opened the door the rack came right out and you could get your toast without having to reach in. I would love to see that feature again.. I hope the manufactureres of this toaster oven read this and add it.. Then this would be perfect..\n \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven 4 Slice, Multi-function Stainless Steel with Timer - Toast - Bake - Broil Settings, Natural Convection - 1100 Watt --is a great addition to our kitchen.  It is much more powerful than our previous entry level \n  This product is easy to use and looks like a professional stove brand but smaller!  The stainless steel does not show finger prints and cleans easily. I looked for weeks at many other brands and was grateful I found Mueller.  I loved that they gave a recipe book and also a free peeler as well. I thought it might be too big however it fits on my kitchen counter perfectly. I was impressed with the 2-year warranty. Did not find that with any other manufacturer I researched. A great find.  Harold R.- Houston TX\n \n  Just received my Mueller Toaster Oven.  It was well packaged and delivered promptly.  This is a great little toaster oven. It comes with a rack and baking tray. The crumb tray opens up easily and will be handy to keep clean. There is an Instruction Manual and Recipe book also included.  The 3 knobs on the oven are for Temperature, Function, and Time.  They are very easy to use. Please note that the settings are manual and are not digital which I really like. Less likely to have problems with it. Temperature ranges from 150-450 degrees. There are 3 Function choices designated with an icon - Bake, Broil and Toast. The timer goes up to 30 minutes or you can use without a time control by turning knob to Stay On position.  I christened the toaster/oven by making toast! I turned temp to Max, turned the Function knob to the Toast icon and set the timer for Darker setting. It took longer than a regular toaster but I was testing it and will have to adjust. Also baked biscuits in it which turned out great and didn\u2019t have to use all the electricity to pre-heat and bake in my range. A Temperature Guide for different kinds of foods is included in the Instruction Manual.  I am very pleased and happy with this purchase.  The Mueller oven has a sleek design, is multi functional, and so easy to use.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for a toaster oven.\n \n  I like that it's pretty simple to use. No complicated, overly technical stuff. Basic functions. We use ours everyday. It was actually a quick replacement to warm up pizzas, fries and chicken nuggets..etc after our oven when out. The toast function works really well and I actually baking pizza in this rather the the oven because it heats more evenly and the pizza comes out nice and crispy. \n  This great oven is made by an Austrian company, Mueller.  It is sleek with a sturdy design.  It has great sturdy controls with a well designed timer that allows you to accurately time cooking or just leave the oven on without using the timing device.  It has an easy to clean detachable oven bottom.  The heating elements are enclosed and not exposed - easy to clean.  5 star rating!\n \n  Stainless Steel. Blue LED.  Easy to use controls. Large viewing window so easy to see how food is progressing. Great value. Small counter footprint.  Nice results on my first few projects.\n \n  I have had toaster ovens for many years.  I basically just use the bake setting, since these ovens rarely toast well. \n  We purchased this oven to replace our toaster.  I can only rate this product as average.  The wattage is low, which requires additional time to make toast, etc.\n \n  UPDATED REVIEW: ", "\n  The heat generated from such a small device is impressive.  Heats up to 450 quickly.  But it is not so much a toaster oven as there is no toast setting.  You have to set a timer and then watch to make sure it is not burning.  The rack settings are either 2/3 of the way up or 2/3 of the way down so unlike a toaster which is designed to toast evenly this will toast one side more than the other based on positioning of the rack.  As an mini it is great.  But I planned to use more as a toaster.  Having said that I did make garlic toast which came out well after I adjusted the wire rack during the toasting process.  But I did have to pay close attention to the toast so it did not burn.  For all other purposes seems to be a nice little unit.\n \n  This toaster over is so easy to use.  Only have three knobs.  One is stop, broil, bake and toast. Another is temperature and the lasts a timer. No electronic to mess this up which was the demise of my last oven. It is small and fits well in a small kitchen nicely.  I give it 4 stars because there is a couple of problems I had to remedy. First it does get hot if cooking for some time. The door handle does not get hot but the steel plate right behind it does and I burned my finger the first time on the burn out they recommend in their instructions.  I cut a small 1 1/18\u201d X 9.75\u201d thin board and lodge it between the handle latches. This fixed this.  The wire tray does not slide out when you open the glass door after toasting. I simple folded some tin foil and looped it around the wire tray. Just reach in grab the foil and slide it out.  Not sure why their engineers didn\u2019t figure this out before production. If it wasn\u2019t for these small problems it would have been a 5.\n \n  Good solid product. Unboxed today. Shipped quickly. Heats fast and seems to heat eavenly. Looks nice. Compact and attractive (as attractive and I\u2019d expect a toaster to be).\n \n  I should have just send it back after it came, it felt flimsy and very light weight. After two weeks the door started becoming stuck and didn't want to open. Maybe it got damaged in shipping? The box wasn't damaged in any way. Haven't seen anyone else mention this problem I had. \n  We use this to toast fresh baked sourdough bread.  Great little toaster for the price, and heats up much faster than having to heat the entire oven. \n  I have baked apples, pot pies, heated pizzas & made toast in my new toaster oven. The pizza & small pot pies were evenly heated, no burn areas while others were OK. It has a wonderful timer a quick distinct ring that's loud enough to hear several feet away. I use it as a timer to tell me when the oven is warmed up + also when things are cooked [it turns off automatically when the timer goes off.  A blue light goes on when it's on. It has smaller print on the side panel because of its size. The knobs are easy to turn.\n \n  Overall I like this toaster. Fits well in our apartment with small kitchen. \n  Was excited to receive this toaster oven due to all the high ratings. I was very disappointed when the timer did not work correctly for the toast settings. The oven does not turn on unless you turn the timer dial past the \u201cmedium\u201d toast setting and then the oven shuts off before passing the \u201clight\u201d toast setting. Basically, it\u2019s defective and not able to do the basic thing it\u2019s supppsed to, make toast.  Other than that, the \u201cminutes\u201d part of the timer worked for the bake settings.  One other weird thing was you need to turn the temperature setting up to max for the toast setting, that\u2019s dumb, it should know it needs max heat for toast when it\u2019s set to \u201ctoast.\u201d I\u2019m plugging back in the cheap $20 toaster oven that we\u2019ve been using for the last 3 years and sending this one back. It at least our cheapy one gets the toast close to correct.\n \n  Attractive smaller toaster oven. Glass and stainless steel on front, black top and sides. Seems to heat up fine. \n  This toaster over does what it says it. Does. It is rather small- which I needed. I do have questions about long term durability as I plan to use this oven practically everyday. So far so good, but we\u2019ll see. I also made a bad assumption when I saw this as an Austria product, I figured it would be more sturdy. It is not. While it looks solid, it\u2019s just as flimsy as it\u2019s competitors. ", "\n  UPDATE: as I wrote this review toasting my English muffin, for the third time I realize the heating element isn\u2019t even working!! \n  I have owned this for FOUR MONTHS and the hinge that holds the door shut broke off tonite when i was getting teady to cook some food for my daughter. I literally propped it shut with a wooden spoon lodged against a 5lb bag of sugar. None None None \n  \u00a0UPDATE: \n  I previously had a Breville toaster oven.  It was a gift so when replacing it I didn't want to pay the price.  This toaster oven had great reviews.  The price seemed reasonable.  Everything about it felt \"cheap\".  Opening the door I could feel how lightweight it was.  In fact the whole unit is lightweight.  It only has one heating element on the bottom and one on the top. The bottom is a drop down door as opposed to a pull out tray which makes it more difficult to clean.  Most annoyingly the tic-tic-tic as it toasts.  When trying to cook a homemade pizza I put it on bake which only uses the bottom element.  I had to switch to toast and then use broil to help melt the cheese.  Toast seems to take longer than it should.  For the price I have bought Black and Decker toaster ovens.  Should have stayed with them. Overall disappointed.\n \n  It's the perfect size and easy to use but the bottom tray does not slide out. Instead one has to pull it down in order to clean. Rather inconvenient.\n \n  I was looking for a smaller toaster oven to take up less space on the counter.  This one does that but also does not accommodate four bread slices for toasting.  Perhaps it was designed for smaller breads than we use at our house.  With many attempts at different placement of bread slices for toasting, the results were always a matter of uneven toasting.  We could not find any placement that would result in even toasting on both sides of the bread.\n \n  It is fairly simple to use. My 8 year old was able to learn to use it. It did take us a moment to realize you have to set the temperature in order to use the toast function. Please use caution when taking tray out because the open door is very hot and it is easy to touch and get burned. This is a smaller oven but can easily toast 2 slices of bread.\n \n  Great price and functionality! The Mueller MT-175 Toaster Oven has easily become one of my go-to kitchen appliances. It is stainless steel and is not unnecessarily bulky, which makes it ideal for homes or apartments with limited counter space (see photo for visual reference). In fact, it is smaller then the package dimensions annotated in the product info section, measuring approx. 9\" x 14 3/4\" x 9 1/4\" (H, W, D).  It is also ideal, if you do not have dual-ovens and need to cook a couple dishes simultaneously. \n  This toaster works fine, but is definitely a lower quality than the Cuisinart that we had before. It is very lightweight and flimsy and it wobbles on flat, even surfaces. I didn\u2019t realize how much I liked my last toaster until replacing it with this one. The craftsmanship on this toaster is poor. There are pieces on each side that should be identical but are slightly off. Overall, I regret this purchase.\n \n  This toaster literally burns everything cursed enough to be put inside it. It\u2019s vindictive and cruel. ", "\n  Just a comment on how hot this thing gets: \n  I was replacing my old toaster oven with this Mueller model because it was on sale.  The directions gave it many restrictions, such as not operating on the same circuit with another appliance  , not placing anything on top and  keeping it several inches away from the wall. After first use, I can see why. It gets extremely hot on the outside. You could very easily get burned. If you decide to place something on top anyway, it will probably melt or stop working if it\u2019s another appliance.  The function settings are written so tiny and light that they are hard to see with the bare eye. Other than that, I guess it does the job. Although I regret purchasing this. \n  The instruction book contains many typos and misleading information.  For instance, it says \"use Crumb Tray\".  Here's the catch:  There is NO CRUMB TRAY PROVIDED with this toaster, and when you look into the interior of the toaster, there is no room to insert one and in addition, the coils underneath the tray shelving make it impossible to thoroughly clean after usage.  You would have to hold the entire toaster upside-down and shake crumbs loose. I find it strange that no one edited the instruction book for erroneous info.  I returned this to Amazon,\n \n  Terrible quality, false advertisement on size, there is NO slide out tray for cleaning , extremely small, not worth the price at all. Do not purchase.\n \n  I love this toaster oven. It's very easy to use. It heats up very fast and won't make you wait long. I love that it cooks evenly. All the settings are very helpful and useful. I love the detachable tray that makes it easy to clean the oven, very convenient. The oven is compact and won't take up too much space in your kitchen. It has beautiful stainless steal finish that goes perfectly with my other appliances. The only thing is this oven's surface gets really hot while operating, so make sure to be careful. Overall, very nice, quality toaster oven that looks great. Highly recommended.\n \n  I liked the small size that it doesn't take up much space on the counter. It looks very nice and it is light weight. I figured out that you have to turn the temp way up to get the heat to stay on. I might be doing something wrong but it works for me so I'll continue that way. Good value for the money as well. I threw my old toaster away and won't even consider purchasing another \"toaster\" as long as this one works the way it does.\n \n  This was a bust. I am replacing it just a few weeks in. Burned the crust of a pizza and rendered it inedible.\n \n  Didn\u2019t work properly...had to return \n  I like this toaster. The controls are easy to read and use. I especially like the tray that is removable. My old one slid into the sides, but this one fits on top of the grill. I like that. The door has a nice sturdy feel with a good handle. It is also attractive and a little larger than my old one but fits well in the same place. The only negative is that it is not a convection oven even though it was said to be \"natural convection.\" I don't know what that means. But I am happy with it.\n \n  I bought this for two reasons: 1) It was supposed to be able to toast 4 pieces of bread at once, which was twice what my old one could do . . . and then this one turned out to be even smaller internally than my old one, and 2) because it had a removable crumb tray. Sadly, even though the description says it has one and the manual says to \"remove the tray and soak it in water to clean\" it has the standard flip down tray my 30 year old toaster oven had. ", "\n  95% of the usage of our old toaster oven was toasting bagels in the morning.  The old one had a lever, so all you had to do was push down on it and adjust the dark/light setting to what worked and then never have to adjust again.  This toaster has a very imprecise knob that I'm supposed to turn to try to set a time for toasting, but half of the time it doesn't even turn on when I set it to the medium setting and the other half it stays on way too long and I end up with two hockey pucks.  The difference between a barely toasted bagel and hockey pucks seems to be one small click, which changes its location each morning to a different part of the knob.  The knob fails to go \"ding\" sometimes which makes me wonder if it even works right.  Then I have to guess what is the correct temp to toast bagels at.  I like the size, the heating element looks like it works well and heats up super fast, but after throwing away bagels morning after morning I'm ready to give up on this one.  To make it the perfect toaster just include the old fashioned button for a fixed duration and let me adjust the heat to find the perfect temp for a well toasted bagel.\n \n  It cooks ok, though not as easy to use as my much older,  cheap one.  It didn't smoke when getting it ready to use (it tells you to heat it up to burn off oils before you cook with it) but did make some funky odor for a little while.  It did smoke a lot once time when I used it, though maybe bc there was still grease in the pan from the use before.  My old toaster oven never did that though no matter how dirty it was.  It hasn't done it since.  I've used it about 8 times or so since getting it a couple weeks ago.  It's a decent size for width and depth,  but not much height like my old one.  Today,  I made a flatbread,  and granted it was piled up a bit (avocado smeared on the bread,  grilled chicken strips,  covered in cheese), and it BARELY fit without hitting the top burner even on the lowest rack. I like the look of the exterior, and the bake/broil/toast function options. Timer only goes to 30 minutes,  so anything longer you'll have to reset it, but for me that's enough for anything I plan to use it for.  It does make a soft ticking sound from the timer... not enough to bother me, but it might for some people.  I can't speak yet to durability.\n \n  Wow. Out of the box, this oven met my expectations which are high. We've had the Hamilton Beach 2 in 1 for over 15 years and although still working, it's old and a little under-powered. We've since grown to a family of four so toasting bread requires a tad more space and yet, we don't want to take up too much countertop space. This is Perfect sized for our needs. The stainless steel is beautiful and matches our kitchen. The dial from ez bottom rack/bake, top rack/broil & both racks/toast is simple. There's a standard temp setting. And the timer works well, with a mechanical 'ding'. I just followed the directions to clean the inside and 'toast/oven clean' for 15 minutes so indeed the place stunk up (this is a must!!). However, I'm no longer concerned with factory chemicals and can't wait to use it tomorrow. At $60, this seems costly compared to our old 2 in1 at $40 but this thing is gorgeous so we can't wait to test out all the functions. Will edit further as needed. \n  The first thing I noticed is that the toaster does not allow for you to adjust (decrease) the amount of time you want your food in the toaster.  If you set it for 10 minutes and then decide to change it to 5 minutes, the knob does not allow you to decrease the time.  It only allows you to increase the time.  So if you set the timer for 10 minutes and take your food out of the toaster after only five minutes, the toaster will continue running for another five minutes.  Secondly, and most importantly, the toaster takes forever to heat anything up.  As an example, I recently took a pancake out of the fridge (it was not frozen) and put it in the toaster for ten minutes.  By the end, it was barely luke warm.  Even when I use the baking function at the highest temperate possible (450 degrees), it takes an extraordinarily long time to heat anything up.  Don't waste your money on this.\n \n  This thing is ridiculous. I have used toaster ovens for many years. I have never had to set a temperature control \n  I have had this toaster for about a month and so far, it has met my expectations. It toasts, defrosts frozen bread and heats leftovers very well. These are the basic functions I want from this appliance---and it has performed excellently, At first I was puzzled about the \"absence\" of a crumb tray---but a quick call to their customer care solved that mystery. The crumb tray is actually the bottom of the toaster and one cleans it by releasing the bottom and tilting the entire appliance. Though a bit awkward, this actually turns out to be a good design decision as there are no gaps for crumbs to fall through or get caught in tight corners. Thus it is easy to clean.\n \n  I usually put a lot of faith in recommended items, especially when the product is a Amazon's choice! I will be more cautious after this. Why bother implying that this item is some how from Austria, when it is from clearly from China? The unit is very cheap, parts don't fit right, the door hinge seems as if it will break any second. I wish I had read more into the comments. I will be returning this as soon as the label comes.\n \n  So far I've used this oven only for baking potatoes and toasting bread and bagels. The toasting function works well, turning out evenly browned bread, once you learn how to set the timing and position the bread in the oven. (It seems there are only two positions for the rack, but this becomes four if you turn the rack upside down.) This involves turning the heat control to the maximum setting, deciding whether you want to brown both sides or only the top (by activating both elements or only the top one). Adjusting the timer for toasting is a skill acquired through practice, as the gradations are narrow, requiring good eyesight and some practice. (Be prepared to scrape some pieces of over-toasted bread at the sink until you learn.) By the way, the timer runs only 30 minutes, so the \"stay on\" setting is well conceived and essential for foods requiring long cook times. But you'll need a supplemental timer; I use the timer on my microwave oven. \n  I purchased this for two reasons. 1) My 15 year old Cuisinart bagle toaster finally gave out, and 2) I needed an easy-to-operate toaster oven for my 11 year old to use. \n  This is the worst product I have ever bought from Amazon!  My tiny Black & Decker was better than this piece of junk!  The crumb tray is a joke... you have to turn the unit on its side to clean because you can\u2019t remove the crumb tray!  The numbers on the dials are so small that I use a magnifying glass to read them!  The heating is awful.  It burns on the top or bottom no matter how you set it!  I\u2019ll replace it soon and I just bought it!\n ", "\n  For performance and ease of operation this little gem is stellar. \n  I like this product so much Till I cannot even imagine myself on not having it And I cannot imagine not going in the kitchen And not using it.I use it each and every day from the first time I took it out of the box and plugged it up and started using it the first day I open the box and I have been using it every day every sense.but I have a gripping problem because I have weakness in my arms and hands when it comes to turning it to the left is hard for me to do because my hands and arms are so weak but when it comes to turning it to the right is easy but only if it had a rubber grip going around it it would be much more easier for the people that have arm and hand problem that have a hard time gripping things and holding on tight that's the only thing that I have a problem with but other than that I have no problem with the product and the product is a breeze to clean it's not hard at all to clean each and every time I am done using it I take me a damp rag and open up the bottom of it take out the flat pad that's in there and clean it off with the damp rag and put it back in and take the right can clean it and some soapy warm water dry it and put it back in after I have wiped out the inside of it with a damp rag so easy and so pleasing thanks for making this product and also thanks for selling it on Amazon and thanks for making the price very easy to pay for to bring home to use for those that had their hardest times for those that's on a spending budget for elderly people that can't leave home hardly that is a good product for them to use and their home at any convenient time of day evening and night.\n \n  Alright, so I am the kind of guy who would get one of those cheap black and deckers or oyster brand toaster ovens and decided you know what, I'm going to get a non-American cheap brand toaster oven. So far, wow it really works. It heats up so fast, for instance, I only needed to per-heat the oven only a minute or two before actually putting the stuff inside it. I am use to putting my pizza in the oven and it taking like 20 minutes to crisp up but this oven it handles a pizza in just a few minutes and can easily burn it if forgotten for a few minutes longer than intended. This is great quality oven, 50$ well spent.\n \n  This toaster overall does not have any great advantage over any other top five rated toaster. The most disappointing feature is the cleaning function for the crumb tray. the crumb tray is located on the outside bottom of the toaster and if you have large hands/fingers it is difficult to detach the crumb tray from the underside of the toaster and also to fit it back into the clip/slot that holds it into place without having to lift/tilt the toaster up onto it back edge, a very poor design. Caution should be used when using the toaster around children, the top of the toaster gets extremely hot and inattention by adult or curiosity by children could lead to severe burns as it appears that there is not insulating material between the inner and out metal skin of the toaster. There is no auto pull out feature for the door as on some toasters to remove the toast from the rack, the rack is so hot that you have to use a fork or tip of a knife to pull the tray out. Would I buy this toaster again, no ways even with a coupon for $10.00 of the regular price this toaster is no better overall than the $21.99 Black & Decker from Macys and its easier to return, I am not going to pack this up and return it, I will probably end up donating it to Goodwill for someone who really needs a toaster.\n \n  First negative is the \"crumb tray\" is not removable. It kind of spring loaded and you can't open it to clean unless you turn the oven on its back. That makes all the crumbs fall to the back of the oven and makes cleaning even harder. Plus you can't remove it to properly clean it in case you have drips that managed to make it to the \"crumb tray\" \n  I wanted a small toaster oven and this is perfect. I bought it to replace a very old one from a different maker. I chose this model due to small size and separate temperature control knob. \n  This oven is clean, compact, and functional. I like it. But there are a few caveats customers should know about: \n  This is a very compact toaster oven so it won't take up a huge amount of space. I purchased it to reheat  smaller meal-size portions of food that I plan to  pre-cook to last say a week(for one person). So far I have just cooked 3 small  pizzas in it.  I cut a 12 in. frozen pizza in half and about 1/2 pizza fits diagonally in the pan provided. It has an adjustable timer so you can tweak the cooking time as needed(vs a preset digital). I undercooked my pizzas the first couple of times(did not read directions). Anyway all three pizzas ultimately came out perfect. The heat seems to be equally distributed as I didn't burn the crust and the cheese came out slightly browned. I feel this is a much better alternative to a microwave. A tuna melt sandwich is next on my list, which I am sure will turn out great!  Take measurements to make sure a smaller-size oven meets your needs. I feel this is a high quality product that will last a long-time.\n \n  This Mueller unit is very small and thinly constructed. This is my second such device formally I had an Oster which is made by Sunbeam. The Mueller looks and feels more like a toy that might have some utility warming rolls or melting cheese on a bun. It is not a serious cooking appliance. Tried baking a chicken breast and broiling some meat. Both tasks were disappointing . \n  I must admit, we were enthusiastic when we read the reviews. A good deal for the price, we thought. And yet, this was the worst small appliance we have bought in a decade. Poor quality, let's start there. Within 5 months of regular use (made toast every few days, used toaster oven to cook things like chicken nuggets or to reheat leftovers), the hinge on the door literally snapped. That rendered the door unusable, unless we held it shut with another object leaning against it. Even prior to that, it was hard to clean (the bottom does not have a crumb pan that slid out, so you had to lift the whole thing and shake it into the garbage; shame on me for missing that detail). To get it hot enough to cook anything you need to dial it up to 400 degrees. We just threw it in a dumpster, and we could not be happier to be rid of it.\n ", "\n  I had this toaster for less than a month (I ordered it July 12 and today is August 5th). First, it is ungodly hot when you're using it, like the entire thing heats up and the outside is extremely hot to the touch. But, it is an oven- so I could live with that. BUT THEN, last night I toasted half a bagel, buttered it up and walked away to enjoy it away from the kitchen and after a loud glass shattering noise, I realized the glass door shattered and redistributed itself ALL OVER MY KITCHEN!\n \n  This toaster oven runs much, much too hot. I mostly use the \"bake\" function, and everything burns no matter which slot the rack is in. I think it's because the heating element never turns off during baking, and I've never had a toaster oven that worked that way. (The others I've had turn off the heating element from time to time to regulate temperature.) I've even turned down the dial a good 75 degrees and baked for less than half the prescribed time, and the bottom burned even though the food I was baking was still cold inside. \n  Sorry, but this one's a joke. The dials are almost impossible to read, because the type is so small. Settings are confusing at best; it's very difficult to clean - especially getting crumbs out of the bottom. And after that, it really doesn't cook very well! This is a best-seller? Do you subtract returns from the purchases?  I have to wonder why I didn't return it (life was a bit too complicated at the time) and I also wonder why I continue to let it use up counter space.  But it does amuse me; the bottom metal place it molded to read \"OPEN\" and \"CLOSED\" with arrows. Except the arrows point the wrong way (in for open, out for closed) and the words are mirror-backwards, as if the plate was installed wrong. While you're waiting... waiting... for your food to cook, you can try to figure a way that the plate could be installed that would make it read correctly! (Spoiler; there isn't one.)\n \n  As the reviews stated this unit will smoke a little and smell when you first turn it on and continue for several cycles so dont cook right away. \n  I originally received a toaster from this company and the toasting element did not work properly.  I wrote a review and their customer service rep instantly replied to me and sent another in the mail as soon as they were back in stock.  This one works as it should and love the toaster.  More importantly, their customer service rep Julia was absolutely amazing!! She was diligent and responsive and I am extremely impressed by this company!! I will definitely order more from them.  They stand behind their products and customers as every good company should!! You won't be disappointed!! Thank you Julia for making this experience a great one!!\n \n  I returned this toaster oven and I'll tell you why. First, the toasting control is a dial that you have to turn for every toast. The difference between light, medium, dark toast is about 1 millimeter. It is impossible to get an easy reproducible toast. You have to watch what you toast instead of just walking away and having the timer go off. On other toaster ovens I've set the toast level I want once and push a button for each toast. Second,  it takes forever to toast! Even at the highest temperature. Yes, you have to set the temperature of your toasting as well as darkness level with two separate dials. It also toasts unevenly. We had to position the rack very close to the top near the heating mechanism. Even with this positioning it would slowly melt Swiss cheese on top of a sandwich. If we positioned the rack too low, the bottom the bread would be burnt to a crisp and the top would be barely toasted. Thirdly, and this isn't the biggest deal, the heating mechanisms are the brightest I've ever seen in a toaster oven. Oddly, you'd think this would make them very hot and would toast quickly, but they don't! So you're standing there with this bright toaster oven thinking it's going to fry your bread to ash but nothing is happening! It is very annoying. We are toast people and I cannot recommend this toaster oven. I was actually surprised to see it as an Amazon's Choice product, I've always thought their recommendations were good.\n \n  Timer is very insensitive making it essentially impossible to do a light toast. The metal grating over the heating coils blocks the heat so you end up with a band of barely toasted area in the middle of your food. The timer for cooking time is also terrible and I have to use my stove/phone timer if I want accuracy. Wouldn\u2019t buy this toaster again, but hey it looks nice and matches my kitchen so we will stick it out for now. \n  Update: You really can't bake with this toaster oven. Burns on the bottom and cooks unevenly. I think I will try much lower temperature settings to see if this helps this problem. That said, the oven heats up quickly and when you are in a rush it is great to heat things fast. \n  This is an unconventional toaster oven which proves that good looks aren't everything. The first time I tried to make toast was an utter failure. I put the bread in, turned the toast knob to medium. Ticking began and shortly after the bell rang and I withdrew the same piece of bread, completely untoasted. When all else fails \"read the directions.\" From the directions I learned that you have to first set the temperature to get the oven to light; why it was necessary to design it this way I don't know. So turn the temp up high and then set the toast knob to the desired darkness. This works but it takes a few times to get the settings just right, at which point the toaster produces a nice piece of toast. It would have been good to have the toaster rack automatically slide out when you open the door. This was a feature of our old Cuisinart toaster oven and it made it easier to withdraw the toast without also toasting your hand. I haven't use the oven for anything else but toasting to this point.\n \n  This was a replacement for an old B&D toaster over that finally gave up.  Used the B&D models for years finally decided to try something new.  The Mueller seemed to be  about the right price.  Delivery was flawless and the unit looks good.  Fits counter space nicely.  It does take a few times to get toast to the way you want it (temp, time and toast location).  Tried the bake and broil settings and seems ok for small dishes.  The quality of the unit seems no better or worse than the B&D but time will tell.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s a smaller toaster oven which is perfect for 1-2 people. Definitely follow the instructions for your first time use! It\u2019s easy to clean and access. I can\u2019t say too much about temperature control but it seems to be working fine. Heat distribution may be a little off. (I burn the bottom of my cookies when I use the suggested time on the packaging, but notice they\u2019re fine if I reduce the time and then let them sit in the toaster oven while it cools  a couple minutes to finish off the top part of the cookies) overall pleased with the product.\n \n  The Mueller toaster oven is quite compact, smaller than the Amazon specs (until I realized that Amazon listed the package dimensions, not the product dimensions), which was a sweet surprise because it fits even better in our small kitchen next to the microwave. I like the three function knobs, keeping temp, function (bake, broil, toast), and timer separate and easy to adjust. The only negative is that the exterior gets quite hot, so one must be careful, but I am not bothered by this. Overall, I would assign 4.5 stars, but since it's either 4 or 5, I'm giving it 5 because it seems to meet all other expectations. We just set it up and started using it, so we'll see how it does a few months down the road.\n \n  I did a search for dimensions and this toaster oven came up; received it today and was disappointed to see that is was smaller than expected inside.  Went back to read the full description again and seen that the dimension were of the package - wow. \n  I was replacing my 7yr old Kitchenaid Toaster Oven which served me well but started failing. Didn't know where to start so I was comparing a few brands on Amazon. The one I was about to buy was Cuisinart Toaster Oven .  Some of the reviews were not favorable. My biggest problem was that it was made in CHINA.  I noticed this brand, Mueller, and read the reviews on it.  Most people seemed to be very happy with their purchase. I thought about it for a while and decided the price was good and it was made in AUSTRIA. So, I bought it. When it arrived , I was a surprised how much smaller it was than my Kitchenaid.  But, it takes so much less counter space up, it works well for me. I have used it almost every day since it arrived and it works well and I really like it. It is definiitely worth getting. My advise, is GET IT!\n \n  Safety is important with this product....heats up quickly and whole unit feels  hot underneath .....Decided to set unit in a heavy duty cooking metal cooking sheet.....this works great with no heat on the counter area underneath it.....out side areas get warm enough to recommend doing what instruction brochure suggests!  Toasting bread requires constant observation...Otherwise oven works great with the other options..\n \n  A 'toaster/oven' is a compromise. Some make good toast but the oven is too small or underpowered. Some ovens work great but toasting is an afterthought. This model seems a good compromise between both. You have complete control over temperature, which elements heat and the time. I was a little unsure with only a lower and upper heating element that toasting would work, but it does. The dark setting on toast most definitely is what it says. Oven wise I can fit a much larger pan than I am used to and so we now use the main oven less for reheating. \n  Don't like this at all. Bought for my 78 old step father. Several things I don't like about it. First off, it's very tiny. Only the smallest of things will fit in this. Also, the writing is very small next to the controls. Very little space distribution between the different toast settings, you're not quite sure what you have it set on. Also, the timer tickticktickticktickticks as it counts down. How obnoxious! If that wasn't enough, what really pushed me to return it is it doesn't sit flush on the counter. One of the legs must have been shorter than the others...it rocked back and forth and was not solidly on the counter. My step father wanted to put a big fluffy towel under it to compensate...hello fire danger. Very disappointed in this.\n \n  We bought this in late August 2018. It's now early June 2019 and I'm afraid to use it anymore so I'm actually on here looking for a replacement. It was a good little toaster oven while it lasted, but it really should have lasted longer. I chose it initially because I had a very specific spot I wanted to put it in, so space was limited. This was one of the only options with a smaller footprint. If you want something short term and you're short on space, this is probably fine. If you're hoping it will last a few years, I wouldn't count on it.\n \n  This is an update to an earlier review.  The oven that was originally delivered to us was defective -- the handle on the door got very hot.  We posted a review about the heat hazard.  The seller reached out to us several weeks ago months after the purchase.  The end result was they sent us a newer model. \n  I am giving this product a four star overall. The reason is because I realize how to use it properly. The heat is a bit uneven and to bake you need to have the machine for max time. The first few times of use it didn\u2019t work very well but now it heats up well. Be wary of burning food though since the thing only heats on the bottom. The tray is the main issue when it comes to heat distribution. Its too thick. I have been using my old toaster ovens tray. I prefer not using a tray at all for the best results too. If you are toasting something, remember to flip whatever it is because again, the bottom heat is very powerful. The price is way to high for this.\n ", "\n  Did a test by toasting a sandwich and it heated up fast and evenly. We bought it so that we could have something in case of a hurricane to you use with our generator. It worked out great and it only consumes 1100 watts. Might be small for some people so make sure you check its dimensions.\n \n  Updated.  This company reached out after my previous review and sent out a new unit.  I did not reached out to their customer service prior to my review as I should have. They stand by their produce and I appreciate loyalty more than my previous frustration. \n  UPDATE REVIEW: \n  The first oven I received had some sort of power issue, and wouldn't turn on at all.  The company was great to send a replacement.  This replacement oven did turn on and functioned...sometimes.  It stops heating at times, even when there are 10-20 minutes left on the timer.  At first, I thought it was just stopping periodically to control the internal temp, but that wasn't the case. It would stop heating and then not come on again.  At other times, it worked fine, but it was a toss of the dice as to whether the food was going to heat up properly or not.  Toast burns on one side and stays almost completely untoasted on the other side. I contacted Amazon and am returning the oven, and will purchase another brand.  I really wanted to like this small, basic toaster oven, but unfortunately, cannot recommend it.\n \n  This works fine, even well as an oven. As is the case with most  toaster ovens ,(certainly ones at this price point)they don't work very well as toasters. The thing to be aware of with this particular toaster oven is that the controls are simple and not in a good way. One for temperature, one for mode, bake/ broil/toast and another one, a 'stay on' setting or a timer which is for toasting. You must make sure the temperature is turned up to its maximum setting when you want to toast, the  control doesn't do that automatically. I also had to put a broad rubber band on the toast/oven round switch because it was hard to turn because of its smooth surface. The bottom opens nicely for cleaning and getting rid of crumbs. Bottom line, oven works well, controls are poorly conceived . If you want a toaster this is not your best choice.\n \n  I am already searching for a better toaster oven after owning this one for 6 months.  I should have known at this price, it would not be the quality I would be happy with - toast burns, the baking pan is flimsy and became charcoaled after the second time I used it.  Very uneven baking and very uneven toasting.  It is also difficult to clean the bottom due to the position of the heating element.  It now looks MUCH older and worn than it should after only 6 months, as I have only used it about 3 times a week.  This is NOT the right choice!  Go for the Breville - I am.\n \n  You get what you pay for. It does toast things up super fast but at the same time runs extremely hot. It\u2019s probably the most basic toaster oven you can buy for the price. Tray doesn\u2019t slide out when you open the door, it\u2019s not convenient to clean either. No removable tray on bottom that you can slide out to remove burnt and dropped pieces. So you have to unplug the toaster- turn it upside down open the bottom side and clean it that way. I wouldn\u2019t recommend or purchase again. But if you\u2019re single or don\u2019t use it much it\u2019s probably fine. Not good for lots of use or families (meaning lots of people using who may or may not clean up after themselves).\n \n  We wanted a smaller toaster oven and came across this model. The size is perfect for a small family however don't let the size fool you this can toast, roast, bake, keep warm and more. The most attractive feature is the quartz heaters - fast, maintains good temperature control. For toasting make sure the temperature is set high, otherwise it may not toast. Used multiple times a day for heating, toasting, warming plates, cooking with not issues. The only problem we ran into is the spring that closes the door. Fell off a few times, being handy I looked into the spring, after applying a graphite lube has been flawless. Some reviews had issues with cleaning or removing the bottom tray, however we had no issues - pretty intuitive. Overall very pleased\n \n  Save your money and buy something else. I bought this to replace a Cuisinart toaster oven that I had for many years, and I was impressed by all the good reviews and ratings this one had. I do not understand what the good ratings are for. Basically, this toaster oven fails on every measure. \n  This is a lot bigger then you expect.  I was able to toast and cook lasagna at the same time and since it's almost instant heat, I didn't have to wait for the pre-heat and it took less time.  Not only that, about 20 mins after I turned it off it was cool enough for me to clean it. I was amazed with the speed this thing operates.\n ", "\n  I finally made the switch from conventional 4-slice toaster to toaster oven, and WOW what a difference!!  This is my first toaster oven ever, so I can't compare to other types/brands -- but I can say that this Mueller oven is EXCELLENT.  It cooks frozen french fries and frozen waffles perfectly, lightly crispy on outside and fluffy inside, and smells wonderful while baking.  This little oven is super easy to use, to clean, cooks evenly, and does not heat up the kitchen like my big oven does.  There are no burnt or soggy edges whatsoever like with my old toaster.  I highly recommend this Mueller toaster oven, and am beyond happy with it.  Just so folks know, it's not huge, but we wanted this smaller size for our counter and makes just enough for 1-2 people.  It was also a great price for all it does.\n \n  I do like this toaster oven and all of its features. However, regardless of the temp./setting, it gets beyond hot on top and the outside perimeter of oven.  Make sure you do NOT have anything on top or close by as it would melt anything close to it.  Because of this is why I gave it 4 Stars!\n \n  I have many quibbles. \n  I could not get over the fact that the crumb tray is NOT removable so you must unplug and turn the oven upside down or brush the crumbs onto a countertop. I can't imagine trying to clean a liquid spill/burn... \n  I needed a somewhat small toaster oven to have at work. I use it to toast, bake and broil every day. The product came as described. Ive been using it a couple weeks and it seems to do the job I wanted. It only came with one rack and pan which is what it shows it comes with but I needed 2 racks if I am to broil decent. You need a rack to put the drip pan on and on the lower rack setting. Food goes on an upper rack at least that's how I like to broil. The customer service at the company was great and is sending me another rack at no charge and really was concerned about my satisfaction on their product. id recommend this product, at least it works for me.\n \n  NiteFixed my blocked posts. I wondered where everybody had been! This is good to know. It's ridiculous to have over 500 friends and only 25 are allowed to see my posts. \n  I'm shocked at the glowing reviews in light of the price of this piece. It's a small, lightweight toaster oven. That's not a negative but the price? If I saw this in person (rather than here online) there is no way I would pay anymore than $30 MAX including tax. If it had been around $30 then I would be saying, it's OK, worth what I paid for it. At $50, it's overpriced imo. Tinny in the headline is not a typo, it has a tinny feel to it due to how lightweight it is. \n  I've had it for several months, the hinge started making strange noises like metal scraping plus a spring scratching noise, then the spring popped off of where it attaches to the door so the door falls open and smacks on the table. I can't keep the door closed without putting an object in front of it to hold it shut (dangerous) \n  I bought this toaster oven to replace one that stopped working. This is a nice toaster oven. It heats up super fast and does a nice job at cooking the food to an even consistency.  There is not room enough to cook a 12\" pizza without cutting it in half. A square Totino's party pizza fits in the toaster over perfectly with no room to spare.  I will caution anyone buying this that the outside of this oven gets extremely hot. All in All it is a nice little toaster oven and does the job.\n \n  Thank goodness everyone was okay but the toast legit caught on fire on the inside. There were 3 flames \u2014 HUGE for a toaster oven this size. Luckily I bought A fire extinguisher when I first Moved into the house (thank you, amazon Prime) a few months ago and that I\u2019ve had training in using it. ", "\n  I doubt the temperature accuracy of this oven.  I didn't buy for toaster reasons but for small oven reasons and will buy a thermostat to set inside to determine accuracy.  Set it at product recommended temp , preheated and yet had to up the temp 25 degrees and still took 20 minutes longer than package advised (stuffed bread).  Also does not come with much of any directions on how to use.  One page plus picture printed fluff for air fry.  Only tried one air fry and not the best start.  Fresh sweet pototoes.  I don't buy processed food and will try other things before I finally comment on that function.  I do like the interior size but holding off judgement overall.  Will update this review as I work with this product\n \n  In 35 years of owning toaster ovens, this is the worst design I have ever seen. \n  It\u2019s the right size for our kitchen counter in that it holds 4 pieces of toast. Many toasters advertise themselves now as countertop pizza ovens and list the diameter of pizza they will hold. We use this for toast and reheating leftover food. I feared that the single heating element on top and bottom would burn the toast in the center and leave it barely crisp on the edges but I was happy to see that even 4 slices of bread come out very evenly toasted when the rack is in the center position. We love this Mueller toaster and are glad Amazon recommended it due to its high number of 4 and 5 star reviews!\n \n  I've only used this a couple of times so far, but I'm pleased with it. I'd never heard of the brand, but I was looking for a small, inexpensive countertop oven and finally decided to give this one a try. I was tired of firing up the range oven for every little cooking job and heating up the apartment - especially in the summer heat with the A/C already struggling to keep up. It arrived in good shape and has done a great job so far. It even came with a little recipe book and some of the recipes look pretty good - I'm not much of a cook but I might even try a few of them.\n \n  I just received my new toaster oven from Mueller, a brand from Austria.  I didn't hesitate purchasing this oven because I own other kitchen products from the brand and have always been very happy with the construction and durability.  This toaster bakes, broils and has convection.  It came with a rack and baking pan.  The stainless steel provides a wonderful professional look to my kitchen and it shows no finger prints!  The oven is super easy to use and clean.  The instruction book also has some recipes and a option to receive a free julienner peeler as a thank you.  So happy with this purchase because it works wonderfully, thank you Mueller.  *****\n \n  Great little toaster oven!  Good for many uses and the features are wonderful! Oven temperature control, built in timer, and even a broil feature!  All the amenities of a big oven appliance but without heating the entire kitchen for a small amount of food.  Good price too!\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size for small kitchen. It is user friendly and bonus it comes with a mini cook book! I\u2019m excited to keep using this product. It has many different setting perfect for baking small items even cookies! You can also toast a broil. This toaster oven so far seems to be perfect for my small family. It\u2019s a great quality appliance and energy efficient! When cooking just for 1 person it has even replaced my oven which is a blessing on summer days! It doesn\u2019t over heat the house like my oven does!\n \n  Pros: \n  This toaster oven had only one element across the top in the middle and only one across the bottom in the middle.  Wonder how it could toast or bake at the very front or back of the oven.  The broiler/baking tray did not have deep enough grooves for the juices to drain away when broiling which then required that the meat would have to lay in the raw meat juices when the cooked side was turned down to cook the other side.  The tray was not wide enough to fit in the slots at the sides of the oven.  It had to set on the wire rack otherwise the meat could have laid on the rack and dripped down into the broiling pan.\n \n  We purchased this product to essentially sit on our counter and supplement our gas oven. ", "\n  This oven is serving us very well and we liked it even more than we expected. There is only one this we would change and that's the \"crumb tray\". It is not a pull out crumb tray. It is only hinged at the back and you have to tilt the unit backwards on a \"peg\" that is made to do so, but it only opens up and it quite difficult to really get it clean. Also the tray is made from fairly thin metal that does buckle a little with the heat. If they would just improve this bottom tray a little (make it pull out and make it from a stronger metal) this would really be an A+++ product.\n \n  Great little toaster oven! With summer here I hate to use the oven and add all that heat to our house, this solves that issue for so many items. My kids bake crescent rolls for breakfast, pizza rolls at lunch, and s'mores pies for after dinner. We have had this about a week and it has gotten plenty of use both as a toaster and to bake. Temperatures are accurate and the timer is nice and loud so it can be heard without being tied to the kitchen. \n  I love this oven! I initially was looking for a toaster oven and came across this multi-function oven and decided to get this so I didn\u2019t have to use my large oven for smaller dishes, and to not have to use my large oven during summer months as it releases a lot of heat.  I\u2019ve used the bake, broil, and toast settings so far and they\u2019ve all worked just as I hoped, with speed and to perfection! Completely worth every penny!\n \n  I reached out to the seller when I found my toaster oven to be defective.  They are sending a new one to me free of charge.  I am very pleased with their response to this issue.  I am hoping the new one will be perfect.  They assured me that if it doesn't meet with my satisfaction, they will refund my money.  I highly recommend.  The oven itself is beautiful, and fits in my small kitchen space perfectly.  The cord is also long enough to reach the outlet where other brands were not.\n \n  The first one I received started smoking from on of the knobs when I turned it on. I reached out to the manufacturer and they were easy to deal with and sent me a new replacement unit and told me to discard the \u201cdefective\u201d one. That\u2019s really the only reason I would give this 2 stars instead of 1. \n  This is my first toaster oven and I've had it for a month now. While I enjoy having a toaster oven, I am already running into some issues with the appliance. The crumb tray (which is not removable) curves up when heated, so part of it ends up touching the piece of metal underneath the bottom heating element. It looks like it's slowly burning through the crumb tray (marks on both inside and outside of the tray from this), and I can imagine it will only get worse. Maybe because of this (or could just be the appliance), there is a weird smell whenever I use the toaster oven. Additionally, the heating elements just stopped working while making toast this morning and I could not get them to turn back on for several hours. It seems to be working again now, but never a good sign when something stops working after only a few weeks. Unfortunately, the return window closed yesterday, otherwise I would return for a different toaster oven. I regret not returning sooner.\n \n  my parents toaster oven is old and in need of replacement so i bought this and it looked so much better and worked almost the same just look better. this broke within a month or so and apparently didn't work anymore and they threw it away. also had bad heat control sometimes the timer would get stuck and continuing cooking so you would have no idea that you're 15 minute timer was stuck at 10 minutes for 30 minutes and everything is burnt. never cooks the bottom as fast as the top\n \n  This machine isn\u2019t meant for people that cannot read small print. The controls print is so small I have to have my reading glasses on to operate. On top of that the elements are very odd and it\u2019s a very SMALL unit.  I sent this back after one use.\n \n  I bought this for my travel trailer since it doesn't have an oven. I love this purchase! Doesnt take up too much room and adds to our food menu. One more awesome thing about it is that it comes with a grippy bottom so it doesnt slide off the counter even when we drive. Definitely recommend!\n \n  OMG... What a disappointment. Pay $50 for a nice toaster oven, and this is what you get:  First of all, I read my electric meter every day. The 20 minutes the toaster oven was on , burning my food, my revolutions on my meter went up from 4.95 revolutions to 5.19... This thing is NOT energy efficient. Second. I put 4 hot dogs in for dinner for 10 minutes. The heat was sooooo hot, it Burnt the bottoms of the hot dogs, yet, did not \"cook\" them. after 10 more minutes... I had crusty, burnt hot dogs which were still raw. It is NOT heat distributed nor temperature controlled.  My Oster was really nice, but, after 3 months the TIMER went \"whacko\" and I could not set the timer to cook my food...\n ", "\n  We will need to return the toaster.  The actual oven is truly tiny.  The recipe booklet that came with the toaster must be for a larger toaster. We had hoped to use the oven to bake two personal pot pies, but the second pie was not even close to fitting due to insufficient depth and width.  In addition, the top element is situated in such a way that it reduces the available height of the oven.  Can you recommend a model that has a larger functional oven space?\n \n  We finally used the oven today.  Toast in the morning with no problem following instruction booklet then reheated frozen smoked pizza; oven was perfect for both, just watch your toast.  We left rack at lowest position so flipped toast after checking for doneness.  Pizza was in tray at lowest position for 13 min and thawed pizza was perfectly crusty and melted.  Hope it continues to perform, oh and it didn't heat the kitchen!  We bought it to use in our sticks and bricks home but ultimately is to use in our Airstream during hot summer camping trips for cookies, etc and at only 1100 amps, that can be handled easily by our stock inverter!!\n \n  I read so many positive reviews, I thought I was getting a toaster oven to end all toaster ovens. \n  I mostly bought the Mueller 1100w Ultratemp Toaster Oven because it is advertised as being \"specially designed for even toasting of up to 4 slices of bread\", and I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, I have found the toaster function to be extremely inferior to other toaster ovens by other manufacturers (most of which are not great to begin with). The instructions with the Mueller oven do not even recommend a temperature setting for toast, so I experimented at between 350 - 450 degrees (most often recommended by other manufacturers). The \"light\", \"medium\" and \"dark\" settings on the \"Time\" dial are useless and have no relevance to the way the bread will actually toast.  The \"Broil\" and \"Bake\" functions seem to be reasonably good, but certainly no better than many basic models that are less expensive than this one.\n \n  I was excited to obtain this toaster as it was the right color and price point for what I will want to do with it, which is mostly toast.  it seems that my family and I go through a toaster oven every few years and because of that, we didn't want to spend a lot.  I like the simplicity of this model as well as its size- it fits nicely on our countertop and won't collect crumbs all over the place like ordinary toasters do.  it's important, I suppose, to make sure that you follow their directions before you use it for the first time- I have done that and all was easy to touch and use- timer, toast and it clearly conducted heat from both top and bottom coils. I am excited to use this toaster oven and if anything changes, I will certainly post.\n \n  *UPDATE AS OF 7/29/2020* \n  I was glad to see the small size since I didn't want a big appliance taking up more room than I wanted.  It has just one rack which is fine, and holds 4 slices of bread or a 9\" pizza.  I can do a small pan of brownies or cake.  It looks well built, so I am hopeful it will last.  One problem is the small type at the knobs, but I am getting used to where to set them.  Very happy with my purchase (even though UPS delivered it to my neighbor, but he brought it to me!).\n \n  After trying at least three other brands over the years, I have finally found a winner!! This toaster oven is power packed and is very well built as well as looks great on my counter. It arrived on time and well packaged. I also appreciated the easy to read manual and recipe book that came with this oven. I also love that I can warm up a couple slices of pizza or some turnovers and can do it quickly and without having to heat up my entire kitchen to do it! (I never use the microwave) I\u2019m very satisfied with this purchase!\n \n  I normally trust the reviews from Amazon customers. This time I feel that they got it wrong. This toaster is not cheap. We use our toaster over a lot because we do not have a microwave.so it is an important purchase. The bottom tray does not come out so you can clean it. It toasts on the bottom only and hardly the top. Crumbs continually fall out on my counter from the inside. I am keeping it because in the grand scheme of things, it does the job. This is my first world problem. My suggestion is get another one. :)\n \n  Bought this for our  Airbnb casita and it fits the bill perfectly because of it's compact exterior size.  All the  while still holding as much as the previous toaster oven we had which was at least 30% larger exterior.  And it looks sharp too.\n ", "\n  This is an unsafe and really terrible toaster over.  The top end of the glass door has metal that gets hot and will burn your knuckle if it touches as you open the door, I did day one.  If you want to toast something you have to set the temp, no idea why and they don\u2019t tell you what temp to set toaster had to check other review on Amazon.  Bake function is terrible, want to cook a pizza good luck melting the cheese, it just cools the bottom.  This is such a terrible product\n \n  I was shocked when I got this toaster. I had searched for a toaster oven that would hold 4 slices of bread and had a clean out tray. It did not have either of these options. It was an Amazon \"recommended\" item. I will truthfully say I never used it so I can't really rate the 3 areas of use, but I had to choose something. It is going back and I have ordered a different brand that I have to wait weeks for. The strange thing was when I searched again, after receiving the toaster for the model I bought, it was no longer available!\n \n  Well, I was looking for a compact toaster oven that I could use to bake and toast.  This oven has a couple of problems, one it isn\u2019t east to clean (no removable tray at the bottom) and if not cleaned after each use it smokes, setting off my fire alarm.  Two it does not toast evenly which surprised me, as most toaster ovens do at least toast more than one strip.\n \n  This cooks pretty easily, and doesn't cook the house the way the main oven does. It can be a little hard to adapt recipes to use it, though. Not everything cooks the way it does in a normal oven. \n  total waste of money, the thermostat does cut on/off ok, although the temperature control is way off .. gets ~ 30F hotter than the dial setting... (use a quality interior oven thermometer to set this thing.. I had it set 325F-350F, it was getting to 400F inside).. but WORST, the OUTSIDE gets so ridiculous HOT that will start a fire on your countertop..  you cannot touch the top, sides, or even the front of this hunk of junk, and the countertop underneath gets hot too.. I pity the family with children who puts this junk in the kitchen,, it will scorch or set to fire most thing people might set on top of it without realizing how DANGEROUS this thing is.. BEWARE\n \n  I really wanted to like this toaster oven, based on all the reviews, but I use the toast feature most often and the light medium and dark settings just didn't work, so I've been forced to stand and watch it make toast so it doesn't burn. During my busy mornings, that doesn't work for me. I do like the oven features, but refuse to buy a toaster oven and a toaster. Kind of defeats the purpose of a toaster oven, toaster and oven all in one. If it doesn't make toast as well as the oven features, it shouldn't be labeled a toaster oven. Unfortunately I am returning it.\n \n  A well-designed timer that allows you to precisely time your meal or you can just choose to leave the toaster oven on without using the timing device. Heating elements are not exposed. The best part about it is that it is extremely easy to clean it!!! My kids love the cookies that I made in this toaster oven and I can tell that baking cookies was never easier. This toaster oven fits perfectly in our small kitchen and looks very good in it. Overall, I think this is a good quality toaster oven, great value. I simply enjoy it. Great buy.\n \n  Bought this toaster oven to replace my 4 slice toaster that is on its way out. It arrived today well packed with a great manual and a recipe book. Cleaned it as instructed and ran empty for the first time. Has bake, broil, and toast features as well as a timer and adjustable temp control from 150 to 450 degrees. Well built with a clean look. Has an easy access crumb tray for cleaning. Very happy with this purchase.\n \n  The oven is lightweight and I had doubts about its efficiency, but it works great for toasting muffins, much better than the stove broiler.  I like the range of temperature settings and the rotary timer is superb.  I prefer the analog controls to digital ones.  It is better than heating up the entire kitchen with the stove.  It's also great for melting cheese on sandwiches.\n \n  This is an amazing little toaster oven! What\u2019s not to love?? It shipped quickly and arrived very well packaged. The size is perfect for us. It toasts 4 slices of bread evenly & to perfection. It cooks personal sized pizzas (9 inches or less). Clean up is easy and the crumb tray is a great help. It\u2019s very sleek & stylish looking. The price point is more than reasonable, in fact, it\u2019s a great deal! I would absolutely recommend this product!\n ", "\n  I have needed a new toaster oven for a while now. My old (big brand) one has started making weird noises and the timer stopped working. After researching different brands and reading reviews I went with this one. May I say, I am glad I did. Its super sleek design and compact size sits great on my kitchen counter top. So far I have made toast and pizza on a tortilla. Both came out with great results! It definitely runs a lot smoother than my old one too.  I am excited to use this on a daily basis.\n \n  2nd UPDATE: The company honored their warranty it\u2019s no questions ask. They were very apologetic and communicative, which I appreciate. (Not always the case.) They replaced this item with no additional fees. It\u2019s nice to do business with a smaller company that values their clients. \n  This is a small oven, good if you have limited space. What I like about this oven is that the heating elements have a metal guard to shield from melted cheese and crumbs landing on them. This oven toasts quickly so you will have to watch it and experiment with the temperature settings. For me, this is not a problem. This little oven heats up fast. So far, I've only used it for toast and heating up leftover pizza. The crumb tray doesn't come out. There is a knob on the bottom which opens up but stays attached to the appliance. You may have to tilt the toaster up to clean it properly.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. My old Waring Pro died after 8 years and I could not find one that was exactly like it. When I found this one, I thought I\u2019d give it a try. It exceeds expectations. It looks great in my kitchen and operates easily. So far everything I\u2019ve made in it, dinners, reheating, toasting, has been perfect. I live in Florida, and use my large oven only a few times a year! This oven is large enough to fit even my Corning wear baking dishes.\n \n  I don't like leaving a negative comment but this oven's temperature control is unreliable.  The heating coils never turn off even after correct temp has been reached which results in overdone/burned bottom.  I would return but the time has expired to do that.  The interior is a nice size so that gets the one star but I am very sorry to have made this my choice.\n \n  This toaster is awesome!!!  The European design is really awesome and this toaster works very well.  It is very easy to use and you have a lot of control over all the settings.  The bell that dings after the timer is finished is loud enough to hear across the average size house.  I bought, of all things, a french press from the same company a while back and it has also performed flawlessly so I thought I would take a chance on a toaster oven and so far I am impressed with the build and quality of both.  I recommend this toaster to anyone looking for a toaster in this class. I hope you enjoy.\n \n  I\u2019ve been looking for a small toaster oven for a short while and narrowed in over Mueller. Arrived timely and packed well. Started with toasting bread to try out the heat settings and distribution which came out well. Next up was a pizza and it very well lived up to my expectation. So far I\u2019ve enjoyed using it and seems to doing the job well. It is light body and fits pretty much anywhere in the kitchen. Heats up quickly too so two thumbs up for this toaster oven.\n \n  I've had this oven for about a year and its worked well for general toasting. \n  my toaster over which i had for years finally gave up.  I searched and searched, and finally found the one i wanted.  it is the perfect size, affordable, and seems very well made.  I have used it a couple of times so far, from everything to toast, to cooking some fish - no issues at all.  I am in the housewares business, and have heard about this brand for a long time, and now happy I tried them out!\n \n  I ordered Vegetable Slicer and was surprised by the quality of this brand, so I ordered this oven toaster one week ago. Finally I got it today. The size is not so big (4-slides), the design has good taste. Unfortunately, the heating element was broken, so sad, have to return it.\n ", "\n  There are no clear instructions. For toasting you set a temperature, select toast, and select time to toast. The timer doesn't always stop at off. The crumb tray does not come completely out. I prefer being able to shake out tray directly into the trash can. Looks really nice. Overall it seems to be a good toaster over. I like the tray provided for baking.  I have not had any issues with the door not staying closed as posted in other reviews.\n \n  I have only used this about 6 times now and the door hinge that keeps the door closed, pulls it shut, is malfunctioning. The overall appearance and simplicity is nice, but on bake, when doing brown n serve rolls, the bottoms burn before the tops brown, so the heat distribution must not be proper. I like the size but am disappointed with the door hinge and heating distribution.\n \n  Terrible , just got this for 3 weeks , oven door ruined, hinge not keeping door up. \n  I live alone and do not like to heat up my big oven to heat up the small meals I buy.  This toaster oven is ideal for my needs. It fits nicely on my counter, heats up in minutes and cooks evenly. The package was perfect and survived shipping. \n  I've only had this oven for about a week, and might not have as of yet figured out all the controls.  But I have used it for Toast, English muffins, Chicken Shake n Bake and Pork Shake n Bake.  All have come out fine, except the English were a little under cooked, and I could not figure a way to extend the time.  All and all, good results which I expect will get better with time as I get things figured out. \n  What I didn\u2019t like is you can\u2019t line with aluminum foil so terrible to clean as no tray to pull out. No top heating elements either.\n \n  A very small volume, which does not allow you to cook more overall than a couple of pieces of bread. A very rough time setting, an error of + -3 minutes, which makes you stand on duty at the toaster, if you need to fry the bread. The smoke coming from under the control knobs is extremely annoying (with numerous regular openings). Lack of tray to remove crumbs.\n \n  I like my purchase of this toaster oven! It is a little bigger than I expected, but it's worth it because of all that it does. My normal microwave is broken and annoying, so that is why I bought this so it can replace my toaster and also can double as an oven, making it easier on me. Super happy with my decision!\n \n  I needed a toaster oven without spending over $100, NOT made in China...while this toaster fit both of those requirements, it failed nearly every other point. \n  I was thrilled to receive this little toaster oven in such a timely manner. It was packaged well, no chance of damage. Because of the extremely hot weather in my area, I have not used the oven, just plugged it in to see if it works. The controls are easy to figure out, and it passed the plug-in test. It looks to be a good substitution for my electric stove's oven, which is off-putting because of the electricity it requires. I'll write more after I've used it, but I'm very pleased so far.\n ", "\n  This toaster oven is a smaller version of the one I currently have. It is definitely big enough to do any sort of toaster oven needs. The settings are all similar in terms of the options, temperatures, and timer. The tray is a bit flimsy but I don't think there is really a need for it to be any sturdier. You can also place your item straight on the rack. I do think this is a better option because of versatility than a standard toaster.\n \n  Love it! It\u2019s compact enough to fit in my tiny kitchen which is a struggle. Though it\u2019s compact it still has enough space to cook a decent amount of things. It works great and it\u2019s super simple to use. I\u2019m forgetful and tend to burn things in my oven so this toaster oven is great because it has a timer! Never again will i destroy my mozzarella sticks! Also they include a recipe book with what seems to be some yummy recipes, I\u2019m excited to try them out.\n \n  We can't see why this has such positive reviews. To toast something you first have to set a temperature, then select toast, then set a timer but the timer for toasting is just a small section of a much longer timer so you really are just guessing and must watch your item to make sure it doesn't burn. The difference between light and dark is miniscule. Our old cuisinart toaster oven was much easier to use.\n \n  I purchased this because I needed a small oven so I didn\u2019t have to keep using the big oven for every little thing.  This takes up little space and doesn\u2019t look bulky at all.  I have other mueller products and I expected this to be the same - it did not disappoint.  I haven\u2019t used it all that much but for the ones I have, the outcome was great!\n \n  The toaster seems ok, but I hate being lied to. Made in PRC is the company way of hiding the fact the unit is made in China. They just need to tell the truth. Therefore the one star rating. Muller just tell the truth\n \n  We purchased this oven to replace another that had died. Everything was great, until we turned it on and the unit heated up. The way the handle is placed, when you open the front door the top metal piece running horizontally across the top of the gass, hits the top of your fingers and knuckles, AND IT IS HOT HOT HOT! One pretty bad burn later... Unfortunately we are requesting a return & refund for this item.\n \n  Three major/minor observation.... \n  Very attractive toaster oven with the right price...it cooks and toasts fairly well. Has mechanisms that make cleaning easy. \n  Can't regulate toasting or cooking.  Toast is eather burned or not toasted on one side. \n  The first one did not work. Sent it back and received a replacement. The second one lasted a year and a half. Smoke started coming out of the control panel so I threw out. When oven is on it only heats from the bottom so the bottom of everything is burned and the top is cold. It takes forever to toast anything. Bottom tray does not slide out so you have to hold the entire oven over the garbage to empty it.\n ", "\n  Our Zojirushi toaster oven stopped working after eight years and we decided to give this model a try after reading good reviews.  It has an appealing modern design and heats up very quickly.  It takes about the same footprint as our last toaster but surprisingly it has a larger capacity.  Choice of rack height is also a plus.  We love it and hope it will last long.\n \n  I got this a while back ago. I am just now doing the review because I wanted to use it for a while so my review actually count for something. Is being a while over 3 months and the whole time this toaster oven has been great. Is very practical, easy to clean and it fits just fine on my kitchen counter. I recommend it, is a great oven.\n \n  I received my oven and it does not work at all. The heat element does not work. We have tried everything. It took forever to get here and now I am having to send this one back and wait for the new one.\n \n  Good interior space; good insulation. \n  This thing is smaller than a shoe box.  I bought it because of the great reviews but I was very disappointed when I got it.  The box looked tiny and after I removed it from the packing I couldn't believe how small it was.  My old toaster wasn't huge but it had way more room on the inside. \n  It works great for bagels, slices of pizza, etc. Heats up very quickly. Just be careful to not store anything on / around it. \n  We had a bigger counter top over when the kids still lived at home, but now have found this one to be perfect for the just the 2 of us.  The timer feature is really great, as mine larger one had that as well, and it is a great feature.  The only the negative thing I have to say is that the tray is shallow and it has been hard to find a large enough one that is deeper.  But, not necessarily a deal-breaker, I use a cake pan and make it work.\n \n  This toaster is great. I have one major problem. When it was assembled the wiring between the Broil/Bake mode got reversed. So basically... broil setting is actually bake(lower element turns on)  and Bake settings is actually Broil(upper element)  Normally I would have returned it, but I can remember to use the proper setting for now.  I might open it up someday and switch the wire so that  the unit responds according to the correct knob selection .\n \n  Excellent product - sturdy and well made.  Makes great toast and has a good range of temperature settings.  I like the fact that there is are separate temperature, timer, and setting controls.  Also large enough for smaller baking pans so there are numerous uses for this toaster oven.  Would definitely recommend this item.\n \n  Not only does this oven look good, it's incredibly easy to setup and learn how to use. Excellent instructions! Had it ready to go in less than 20 minutes (and that included a thorough washing of the components). Heats up fast too. Especially like the large window, makes  it easy to watch the progress without letting out heat. The size is great too because it doesn't take up lots of counter space but holds relatively large items. And it's light weight. Love it!\n ", "\n  I just received it yesterday so 3 stars is all I can give until I use it for awhile. \n  I've bought other Mueller products before and have been pleased with the quality and workmanship. This one is no exception. I'm very pleased with my purchase.\n \n  This toaster oven may be small, but it works very well!  I like the compact size since I have very little counter space, and it doesn't get super hot on the outside like some toaster ovens I've had in the past.  All the foods I've made in it so far have come out perfectly and it seems to heat evenly.  My only complaint is that the knobs can be hard to read accurately.  I ended up drawing a line down the side with a marker so I can better see what setting I'm actually on.\n \n  My family uses toaster oven's for making toast a lot.  There's no dedicated timer knob for the toast functionality, so it's *real* difficult to set the timer to the right length for toasting.  And then after a couple weeks of use whatever spring or latch used to hold the door closed disappeared, so now something has to be wedged against the outside of the door while in use to keep it closed.  I'd recommend shopping for something else (as I'm about to do now).\n \n  We ordered this and the door broke within 2 weeks. We had the unit replaced and the new one had a crooked door right out of the box. Not sure that's it's worth trying a 3rd one. I'll be calling the company.\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size for my space! I found it to be easy to operate and works well! I had a little trouble at first with the toasting feature: you have to set it to toast and then pick a temperature before it begins toasting. I was not aware of this at first, but if you crank the temperature knob all the way up and then move the other knob to toast - it works great!\n \n  I love this toaster oven!! It is so lightweight and smaller than the average microwave. I did not expect it to heat up so fast, if you have kids I would suggest keep out of reach because the outside of the toaster oven does heat up. It has a timer feature so you don\u2019t have to worry about missing the time and it keeps your food warm if you put it on the setting. I can see myself taking this for Airbnb travels that do not have stoves.\n \n  I used my new Mueller toaster oven toay and it toasts so quickly, I was delighted and surprised.  So far...so good!I \n  Worst crap ever. We just needed  a reliable \"toaster\" oven. Stay away. It dosen't work as stated at all. If you simply want \"toast\" you have to flip your bread. Ours is listed on Mercari for $10 if anyone is interested. Would have returned it but I'm a nurse and haven't had much time to post reviewsor pay attention to time lately. Anyone want it for free? Disgusting. DO NOT BUY!\n \n  Have had the Mueller less than 1 1/2 yrs & absolutely loved it. However, started having problems with the door when it was less than 1 yr old. It was slightly ajar when cooking. Today the door hinge just fell apart & it\u2019s no longer useable. It\u2019s very disappointing considering my last one (a different brand), lasted close to 10 yrs. I rarely used this Mueller (less than 1 x week) & expected it to last at least a couple of years. It\u2019s really not worth the $ when there are cheaper brands out there that don\u2019t fall apart so easily.\n ", "\n  This toaster oven was exactly what I was looking for. I have limited counter space and was replacing a regular toaster. While this is slightly bigger than my toaster it does not eat up a lot of space and works great!!! I can do many more things in here than a regular toaster and it did not break the budget!\n \n  This toaster oven doesn\u2019t have a removable crumb tray to clean out. It\u2019s very difficult to clean.  Did not figure this out until after the return window. Otherwise decent toaster.\n \n  Another purchase for our camper and its size is perfect. It sits on our dinet table right against the wall and doesnt take up any needed space. It also does produce a lot of exterrior heat that would damage our wallpaper and table top (like pur old school toaster did). Highly recommend\n \n  This toaster oven was exactly what we were looking for.  It is lightweight (especially for its size) and has a modern, sleek look - it does not look bulky on the countertop and easily wipes clean.  It is very easy to use the temperature controls to adjust to a uniform toast at the desired amount.  The heat is also distributed evenly and disburses efficiently; we have no issues with the cabinets above the toaster getting hot.  We have mainly used it to toast bread products so far but it has plenty of options to use for other products.  We chose this product based on the overall reviews and definitely feel like we got a great value product, especially for the price.\n \n  Several things about this oven are problematic.  First, several surfaces including the top and door get extremely hot during operation to the point that they will severely burn your hand if touched directly.  Second, the timer is an egg timer so it is very approximate.  Finally, the crumb tray cannot be removed without flipping the whole unit on its back to unlatch the bottom.  I do not recommend this unit especially because of the first point which makes it extremely dangerous to operate.\n \n  I just got it out of the box today but I\u2019m totally psyched.  it\u2019s on the smaller side very cute stainless steel and glass.  has a wire rack with a baking sheet.  And I turned on the timer for heavy toast and the whole thing lit up Orange red all throughout the inside so I know I\u2019m gonna be happy with it!\n \n  The soggy feeling you get when you heat leftovers is a thing of the past when I use the Mueller convection oven to heat those leftovers. I'm able to enjoy them almost as crispy and delicious as they were and the leftovers do end up tasting about the same as they did when they came out of the big oven from the first time. I would recommend it completely for heating leftovers and cooking small stuff that you don't want to get the oven going for\n \n  Little Powerhouse. I'm very please with this oven. Came well packaged, no dings, or scratches. It's been lest than a week since this arrived. I've bake chicken, a cake, and squash in this oven and everything turned out great. Be careful though. It heats up quickly, and coooks relatively fast. You have to either time whatever you're making, or monitor closely, else it will burn. This is a great addition to any kitchen. Easy cleanup, doesn't heat up the house, and doesn't require a large footprint. Thank you Mueller for a great product.\n \n  A great addition to my kitchen. It\u2019s replaced a 4 slice toaster. Couldn\u2019t wait to try it on my frozen blueberry waffles. Worked perfectly. This toaster oven has a small enough footprint that fits on the counter and looks wonderful. I\u2019ve discovered Mueller products are outstanding. Highly recommended\n \n  Be Ready For It!\n ", "\n  Others gave this unit good reviews, and I am glad I listened. It's a beautiful and compact little toaster oven; fits on our narrow countertop. Design is quite nice and love the big window. Heats evenly and effectively, and I love the timer to remind you to check on your cooking. Really a nice product!!\n \n  I would not recommend it ever and never. After four (4) month the handle is broken. \n  Worked fine for about a year and then the BAKE function stopped working.  It's not the bulb because it works fine on the other settings.\n \n  This oven was great for about 6 weeks, then the toaster only worked in the back part of the oven.  Then I had to manually turn the bread over and push toast again at it would only toast on one side.  Then it wasn't worth using as a toaster any more and that is why I bought it.  I really liked the convection oven function, but that didn't last long.  It quit on my this past week, where it doesn't heat at all.  It was a great  idea, but seems like they didn't build it to last long.  I was using the toaster every morning and the oven once or twice a week, so it didn't get burned out from use!!!  Too bad, but don't buy.  It's heading for the trash.\n \n  Need to update my old toaster oven and was very pleased when I saw this one.  I have a guest house with a small kitchen and this toaster over really looks nice on the kitchen counter.  It works really well for toast and reheating leftovers, such as pizza and evening meals.  I like the stainless steel design of it and it is easy to keep clean.  I would recommend this handsome oven for anyone one looking to update and furnish their kitchen.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Broken door after using it for a week\n \n  I purchased this oven for my son who is in college. The compact size fits great on his counter and he can cook small meals without using the large oven.  After being back in school for less than a week he's cooked a calzone, chicken tenders, and of course cookies!  Both he and his roommate love the oven.\n \n  Since I basically only use it for making toast, it is overkill for me.  The control for making toast is too imprecise.  The handle for turning the toaster on is too small, settings are too small to see so I'm basically 'guessing' every time I turn the knob hoping it comes out right.  I'm sure it is fine for more difficult things than making toast.  My fault, I should have researched it better.\n \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven 4 Slice, Multi-function Stainless Steel with Timer - Toast - Bake - Broil Settings, Natural Convection - 1100 Watt --is a great addition to our kitchen. It is much more powerful than our previous entry level \n  Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She is a trucker with one of those trucks that you have a compartment you can live in. She wanted to be able to bake things so I got this for her and she loves it. She baked cookies and other things and it working out very well for her.\n ", "\n  We have had this toaster for about 2 months now and love it! It's a great size, stylish appearance and does a great job toasting and baking! I thought I was not going to like the fact that the tray does not pull out w the door but we are totally used to it...no problems! I wish there was a crumb tray that you could pull out to clean easier but the stylish look, sturdy construction, even cooking and great price make up for it!\n \n  Very pleased with the size of this. My previous toaster was big and clunky but this doesn\u2019t look uneasy on the eyes while it sits on the kitchen counter. Not to mention, it has double the amount of watt power than my old one. Perfect amount of space inside to make a decently sized meal and the increase in watt power cuts cooking time! Very versatile and perfect when you\u2019re baking something small so you won\u2019t need to heat up your whole oven.\n \n  We haven't cooked a whole chicken in this oven yet, but the air fryer Does cook things Quickly, so don't Overcook at a high temp!  My son Loves it!  Good gift for wedding gifts, or young people who have moved away from home, or even for us old folks!  Everybody here Loves it!!!\n \n  Make sure you do a burn threw at first.. Mine smokes a bit. Other then that it works well for the first time... Im happy\n \n  This toaster oven is not one to have in your home.  The settings around the control knobs are pictures too small to see, too tiny to even read up close which is ridiculous.  The rack inside is totally challenging to position.  And sometimes the oven just heated inconsistently.  Our mistake was trying to acclimate to this and not returning it in time.  We learned.  DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN!!\n \n  you definitely have to let the chemical unboxing smell burn out for a while before use because it was a bit overwhelming but after we got rid of that it has worked wonderfully and we love having an easier way to bake small things that doesn\u2019t heat up the entire house!\n \n  This is a great product for our needs. I wanted something to bake in because out little trailer didn\u2019t have an oven. This fits the bill perfectly!\n \n  This toaster oven is not good for people who are getting old and having vision problems. I couldn\u2019t see the baking temperature without turning all the lights on in the kitchen and putting on my reading glasses. The thin black lettering on the stainless steel is probably inadequate for anyone over 20! Even after thinking I\u2019d conquered the temperature I burnt the only thing I tried to bake in it.\n \n  Efficient. Compact and easy to use. Mueller products are always high quality and their customer service seems to be very engaged. My kids use this little toaster everyday with no issues. Not expensive so I don\u2019t worry about what they cook \ud83e\udd23. Happy with my purchase!\n \n  I got this as a replacement for my old toaster oven, and I am very pleased with how nice it looks. I love the chrome finish; it looks like it's made out of high end materials. It also toasts everything perfectly. It took a little to figure out the right times for different things. I don't like my toast to be super dark and I guess it just depends on how toasted you like your food. I love having a warm sandwich with melted cheese in the morning. I am usually rushing out of the house, but at least I can count on a decent meal on my way to work. I just let the oven do its thing while I get ready and after the beep, I'm out the door.\n ", "\n  Pros \n  Love this oven. It\u2019s large enough to make dinner for two without heating up the kitchen. It\u2019s beautifully designed and looks great on the counter. I use it everyday foe everything from brownies to roasts. The temperature is extremely accurate so there is no guessing with baking times. I would highly recommend his toaster oven.\n \n  I've had this oven for almost 2 weeks and I am happy with it thus far.  I needed an oven with a small footprint and this one fits my limited counter space beautifully.  I like the features and it looks great. The only disappointment is there is NOT a crumb tray that slides out for cleaning.  My last two toaster oven's had that feature and it sure made it convenient. The bottom of this oven opens up and can be cleaned fairly easily while open so I'm getting used to being without the removable tray.  I've used the oven several times and it has done a good job, even toast comes out pretty uniform. The oven does get very hot so the warnings to wear gloves should be taken seriously.  All in all I'm happy with my purchase.\n \n  Toaster oven works great. However, I had a problem with the door latch. The company's truly helpful and professional customer service sent me another unit. If you buy the unir, I would recommend not opening the door when in operation. I believe the heat from the lower heating element has a negative impact on the door latch.\n \n  Mueller is a great brand and this is a great toaster oven. The oven itself has a very nice and compact design and is very light. The hearing elements get hot quickly and the food is heated/cooked quickly. I have no complaints and would consider buying other Mueller products in the future.\n \n  After reading the instructions, I did not realize need to set a temperature to make toast.  Other toaster ovens do not require to set a temp for making toast. My suggestion for you ... under the \"tips\" on making toast, you should recommend a temperature setting.  Otherwise this is a good product.\n \n  This one toasts way faster than my old one! Nice even color ... just need to be careful on the dial cause I have burned more taco shells than ever before! \n  This is awesome! Mueller is an awesome company, I\u2019ve been slowly purchasing more and more from them. I love, and prefer this oven over my larger oven because it heats up and seems to cook a lot faster, I can have a mini frozen pizza in about 10 minutes as compared to 25-30 in the larger oven due to preheat times. You can also toast, and broil in here, it\u2019s also very affordable.\n \n  The recipients say they love it and was exactly what they wanted.  They don't have to turn on the oven for small items and heat up the room.  Also lessens the chance of their young child getting burned by the oven because he can't get to the counter top.\n \n  I like that this oven is easy to use.  I don't need a digital panel or touch screen to make toast! ", "\n  It seems week made- no rough edges. Thought it was made in Austria- but not- it\u2019s made in China... so it is pricey for a toaster for just our purpose of primarily just making toast. This is an elaborate toaster that can be used for small pizzas, etc...\n \n  Update: 8/12/2020 \n  I just got it and am in love! We got it for our RV. I have used it more times than I have used the actual oven in the RV. It's the perfect size and easy to clean too. My kids love cheese toast and my husband and I like to roast veggies in it. I am thinking about getting another for our house too. Great price too!\n \n  Heating up yesterday's pizza in the toaster oven is the best. I hate how the microwave makes everything soggy, this oven makes pizza taste even better the next day. I toast all my sandwiches in there now, it makes a big difference in taste when you have melted cheese. Using the regular oven is a huge pain since I often forget my food, or the oven is too powerful when I need to heat up something small. Without using so much electricity this toaster oven does a great job. The best part is the automatic shut off and the little ding when the food is done.\n \n  The bottom knob that selects \u201cStay on\u201d or \u201ctoast timer\u201d is too hard to turn. I have to use a silicone gripper to turn the dial. \n  Absolutely love our new toaster oven. Easy to clean and perfect for almost anything you want to toast, bake and broil.  It\u2019s the perfect size too!  The old toaster oven is not a good as this new toaster oven. It\u2019s evenly distributes heat to make sure you get the perfect toast on each side. I\u2019ve cooked some cookies and potato skins too!. I am happy with this toaster oven and might get one for my mom and dad too!  It\u2019s a definite must buy for anyone!\n \n  So far I am very pleased with the operation of this toaster oven. The three controls are very clear and easy to use.  Although I have yet to use the broiler, the toasting and heating functions work very well. I highly recommend this toaster oven.\n \n  I enjoy this toaster oven so much. It does so many functions and cooks so many different types of foods. I cooked sausage in it, that I usually put in my air fryer, but it came out better in the toaster oven! It's pretty easy to use and I like the wide temperature range. The food I've cooked so far cooks very evenly. The detachable oven bottom makes it easy to clean.\n \n  I have had the same toaster over for almost a decade and it was time to upgrade to a newer and more innovative appliance. The heat on this oven is stronger than in my old beat up one and it takes half of the time to toast my bread in the morning for breakfast. I love how roomie it is and yet it takes the same amount of space on my counter top. Great purchase and you should get one as well!\n \n  claims \u201ceven heating\u201d but only toasts the part that is right above the heating bar. The oven even stopped working mupltiple times while plugged in and ticking. Got rid of the thing in 2 weeks. Went to kohl\u2019s instead\n ", "\n  I love it I love it! Perfect addition to the kitchen, I had been using my oven to bake and broil as I love to cook - but I have been in the market for a toaster for a while and finally decided on this one. It has exceeded my expectations to say the least. Directions were quick and the device is super easy to use - even for those who have trouble with tech like me.  I have been using it to broil my english muffins for breakfast and it is easy to evaluate the best temperature to use and when the food is done. For the price, I am genuinely impressed. Fantastic product.\n \n  Returned never refunded after shipped. It is a pretty little stove but slove to cook or toast  anything. 6-7 minutes just for a slice of toast after many turns and settings. Get a toaster only, this oven is probably good if you don\u2019t have an oven.\n \n  Uneven heating on all settings. Made garlic toast, some were soft and some were burnt to a crisp. All toast needs to be flipped on toast settings. Barely used and had for just under 3 months, one of the most terrible purchases I ever made. Way past return date:( \n  I hate turning on my actual oven since it usually makes my entire apartment super hot and wanted to get a toaster oven that I could actually use to cook food in and not just warm up leftovers and this one fits the bill. I can cook my personal pizza and also toast and other things that I don't want to waste my time with the oven. I also tried it to cook potatoes and it worked great for that too!\n \n  This toaster oven makes perfect toast.  I love that I can reheat single serving left overs quickly and much better than in the microwave or needing to wait for the kitchen oven to come to temperature.  It looks great on my counter top too!\n \n  Loved how quickly is was shipped!! Also there are options to pick toast, broil, and bake.\n \n  Great toaster oven! Small enough for our small counter, easy to unpack, very sleek looking and we already made cookies in it! Plus my 11 year old can make mini frozen pizzas without heating up the whole kitchen in summer using the oven!\n \n  Looks good, cleans easily but I still haven\u2019t worked out the setting I need to put it on so I don\u2019t burn my rolls or biscuits on the bottom. That\u2019s a sticking point with me. The company I bought it from was great and I received it in a timely manner. I might not order this particular item again but I would buy from the company.\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size, it doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter.  We cook English muffins in the oven, it takes 10 minutes @ 350 degrees, they are perfectly cooked.  We will cook many other foods, we have had for about a week.\n \n  It is very small. Doesn\u2019t heat evenly. To clean  Bottom comes off with a struggle. And it\u2019s made with very thin metal slices my fingers every time. Deep too.  Not happy\n ", "\n  If you want to use this toaster oven to toast toast, this is not the toaster oven for you. This is more for a small oven on the countertop use. \n  A bit flimsy. If you try and remove something like a chicken breast with a fork the rack will collapse and fall down to the bottom under the pressure of a simple fork. Natural convection?!  Ha!  By their definition, every toaster oven has \"Natural convection\". There is no fan in it it's just heat rising. The two-element design makes it hard to toast bread without a streak through the bread where the element is above.  It is not easy to clean and the bottom is hard to keep in. I would buy something else.\n \n  The onion shopper pro was to easy for used I opened clean and used for the breakfast  rigth now, and have more carriots for the super. The toaster oven, really make a great dark toasted and medium farm, italian bread and muffins english\n \n  Copy your review here: Great toaster oven. Looks nice & toasted well. Arrived on time and packaged well!  Better quality than what was available in our local stores.  Definitely recommend this if your considering it as a purchase.\n \n  As far as normal operations for the price you can't beat this.  I had to dock a star because the handle broke less than 2 months after we purchased so now only one side is attached and I have to constantly try to glue the other side.  For the price I guess that's what you get.\n \n  Once I learned how to convert oven instructions to toaster oven instructions, using the toaster oven became easy. It replaces me having to start up my oven for small things like reheating food. My whole family uses it now and we don\u2019t heat up the whole kitchen just to warm up a slice a pizza. This beats microwaving which results in soggy food.\n \n  I just luv my little toaster oven so far! I find it easy to program and the size is perfect for my needs! I've made pizza, bacon, and toast so far and it turned out great! I recommend this for anyone who wants a nice basic toaster oven.\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster oven. It\u2019s just the right size to not take up too much room but big enough to get the job done! Everything is coming out just right so I will definitely purchase from Mueller again!!! The oven is well made and sturdy and matches my kitchen appliances perfectly. If you are on the fence about this product, don\u2019t be, you\u2019ll be more than happy with this toaster oven.\n \n  Nice little toaster oven for those with not a lot of counter space. it comfortably holds a frozen pizza or 2 pieces of toast or 3 English muffins. I've also roasted veggies in it. Good small machine but can do what you need and more. toasting, baking, broiling, etc. i use it almost everyday and it warms up very fast!\n \n  I have never owned a toaster oven and thought this would help with energy costs this winter.  I used to cook for a living and thought this toaster oven would take forever to warm up, but it is fast!  I also liked the cook book that is included.  The few things that annoy me is first off, the timer makes a loud clicking noise until it goes off, like an old alarm clock.  The other thing is the crumb tray is hard to remove, it doesn't just slide out.  No big deal though.  I highly recommend this toaster oven.  It looks nice on my counter.\n ", "\n  So far I like the toaster. What I don\u2019t care for, and why only 4 starts, is how long it takes to toast a piece of bread and how it\u2019s still uneven. I ended up putting the rack on the top slot so the bread wouldn\u2019t  burn. The dial is wrong as well as for toasting light, medium, or dark. I have to do past dark every time, even with the temp all the way up to 450 just for a normal toast. And it still takes almost 5 minutes just to toast a piece of bread.\n \n  It is smaller than my old one but it's ok for a single person pursuing a minimal life. I just want to have one more pan for putting it under a baking rack so that I can have grill marks on my salmon or meat and greasy oil would be dripped onto the pan. However, while writing this review, I had brainstorm. I went to the kitchen and wrapped a rack underneath with aluminum foil. Voila!\n \n  There is no way to clean this oven Because the trade does not slide out it is attached to the toaster oven and I was not expecting that. The temperature is not accurate and it is smaller than I thought it would be But I should\u2019ve looked better at the size of the description.\n \n  This toaster oven has a very nice compact design and works great to toast and warm my foods.  I love it!  The window on the front of the toaster oven is clear and it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on with the food inside.  The controls are easy to use and understand too.\n \n  I set to put the crumb catcher down, but it doesn't go on the bottom!  There is no removable crumb catcher and the heating unit blocks the rear of the unit.  I packed it back up and sent it back!\n \n  We've just begun using our Mueller toaster oven.  Initial reactions from the household are positive.  It's a little smaller than the one we replaced but doesn't seem to affect our usage.  We miss having a crumb tray but like the cleaning door on the bottom.  The controls work well and are easy to learn.  The oven heats up quickly.  Perhaps the nicest surprise is that it actually toasts bread!  Several of its predecessors weren't very good at that.  Overall we're pretty pleased after a week of use.\n \n  Smart looking, and more than adequate for my needs. No point in a bigger unit that would duplicate what already available in a standard oven. Great especially for reheating leftovers or for heating hunks of bread or rolls that wouldn\u2019t fit in a standard toaster. Only minor complaint: the instruction manual says the crumb tray is removable for cleaning. It is not, though it is accessible for cleaning by turning the toaster oven on its back (it\u2019s very light).\n \n  This toaster oven is perfect. I hated my previous one, it always took too long to cook simple food, would get dirty and disgusting really easily and burn half of my toast and the other half would be cold, but this one can even broil food correctly. I live alone, so this makes it easier to cook for myself and keep my electricity bill low, which always helps!\n \n  Exactly as advertised. Very sturdy and well made. Works flawlessly.\n \n  The first and only time I used it (to make toast), the unit\u2019s burner element caught fire from crumbs that had fallen upon it. I glanced over and saw flames.\n ", "\n  The toaster worked fine for the first two months but 2 weeks after that, the door handle broke. I am quite disappointed. The door will no longer stay closed I have to prop it up with something to continue using it. I kept it in the same spot on my counter, cleaned and maintained it regularly, and used it per standard functionality. I also cannot reattach the hinge myself.\n \n  I purchased this toaster oven after reading it's reviews... Although, it does work great & I've been very satisfied with it for the past month since I've had it.. The door will not stay closed, at first I thought there was a magnet somewhere holding it closed, but there isn't! I guess it's just a \"latch\" a the lower left side of the door which looks like it's not connecting to where it's supposed to.  I was going to attempt fixing it myself but am scared I will break it! Needless to say, it does still work & I've been using duct tape to hold it closed...\n \n  Our old Cuisinart toaster oven died and we thought we'd take a chance on a brand we've never used before, and I'm glad we did.  It works perfectly... at first almost too well, as this unit heats up much more quickly than our old one.  We've gotten used to this powerful little oven now, and we're very happy with it!\n \n  cheaply made in china, badly written instructions and cookbook. smells awful for the first two hours despite careful following of instructions and cleaning. the promised free slicer: two sms numbers provided, neither one responsive nor to the email sent to customer service \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven Model MT-175 is a sleek stainless steel treasure! \n  For the price there this is a tremendous value. Why? the difference was the OUTSTANDING technical support I received when I couldn't figure out how to use the timer dial. Yes, I am technically challenged - I admit it! I called the 800 number expecting an automated menu without human contact. However, I was really pleasantly surprised when, within a few rings, a nice man answered the phone with a German or Austrian accent (I think). He was so kind, patient, understanding and thorough.  He emphasized a few times that the product was under warranty and if there was ever and issue to call back and he would help again. I am very pleased to have bought this wonderful Mueller unit and look forward to using it!\n \n  Great small oven for the price. Works just fine for our needs. We have limited counter space and a double oven range, wanted a smaller counter top oven for toast and reheating small quantities of food. This oven works very good. Took me about a week to get the toast to come out just right, now that I have that figured out toast is perfect. Good Buy.\n \n  I gave it a one star for cleaning because I cut myself! I opened the door and was trying to clean the bread crumbs out and accidentally my fingers slid on the metal part of the door and i cut my finger!\n \n  Since we bought this toaster oven, we have used it everyday. It is just my husband and I, so we don't cook a ton of food.  We have made toast, pizza, eggplant parmesan, chicken, etc in this toaster oven.\n \n  This thing works just like a mini oven, you can make pizzas, chicken, shrimp, steak, and you can toast! ", "\n  I like that it is smaller than my previous toaster oven, but it holds the same amount of food. The timer/heat dials are great. Easy to see and set. The heat temperature is accurate. Only downside is cleaning the crumb tray. But that's easy to deal with considering all the positives. Would buy from this seller again!\n \n  After 10 years, my old toaster oven died.  I looked at various ones on-line and saw this one.  Before purchasing it, I went to Kohl's and looked at a few other brands.  Either the ones they had on display were not in stock or the ones in stock, were not on display.  Completely disgusted, I order the Mueller taster over and it arrived in 2 days.  I've used it on frozen pizza and toasted some bread.  It simple to use and heats up quickly.  I've had it less than a week and look forward to many years of toasting and small baking!!\n \n  This is the worst,cheapest, garbage out there. I've had it for 15 minutes and I'm so disappointed !!!  Gonna drive an hour to Walmart to get a \"ReaL\" toaster oven. This says a lot as I try not to buy from Walmart...Can some American companies please start building stuff again, I pay the extra $20.\n \n  So great! We tossed on the microwave in our house because we don't want to be exposed to any EMF radiation from it anymore (yuck)! So we bought this instead and it does the job even better than our microwave did. Love it, would buy again and definitely recommend to a friend\n \n  Terrific little toaster over.  Easy to read instructions and good looking. Takes up little space but you can cut and cook a two pound chicken for example. Heat distribution is excellent and visibility is great.\n \n  This product is well designed and has knob controls for making your selections, easy to use, no electronics or push buttons.  It comes with 2 trays (wired and solid).  It's a great product made in Austria.\n \n  I am from Europe and I usually look for European made products. \n  This oven is smaller than what i expected.  I find that I need to keep on eye on my food when heating since it does tend to  get very hot and burns food quickly.\n \n  Temperature knob is hard to turn (on/off) compared to my previous Black and Decker.  Also toast settings are too hard to predict accurately as the knob is a problem.  The heat distribution on the toast is not even as it browns in some spots more than others.  Cleaning is not as easy as the tray does not slide out.  You have to lift the toaster and unhook the bottom tray which is a pain.  Going back to my Black and Decker so I hope this burns out quickly!\n \n  I did not see any instructions on the proper use of the toaster. I didn't know that you have to put the temperature on to at least 200 degrees to get the Toaster working. Our old Oster Toaster - did not need that. It automatically turned on the Toaster at the desired time. Also, the bread at the end toasted darker that the two on the front.\n ", "\n  Perfect size to sit on my ancient stove in my rental. This little oven works so well and I don\u2019t have to heat up my tiny rental kitchen for just one person. It\u2019s great! Shipping was quick and well packed. Thank you!\n \n  This toaster is compact and takes only minutes to preheat. Simple and perfect for toasting bread, reheating fried chicken, and pizza. The size is also perfect for 1-2 person household.\n \n  Toaster oven is on the smallish side, not sure output is even on upper and lower heating elements as toast gets burned on underside majority of the time. Will have to use more to get used to it.\n \n  This oven is very compact but found it was much too small for us. My husband tried to bake a couple of biscuits but they cooked too fast and burnt.  He said he had read and followed the directions and he was completely angry about his burnt biscuits!\n \n  I read the reviews prior to ordering however ordered one anyway.  Called distributor and was told by person on phone they will correct the issue of ... 'the tray is not wide enough too fit into the side slots.'  This would add greatly for selling purposes.\n \n  I\u2019ve only had it a day but I love that I can cook smaller food items without having to heat up my large electric stove. This little oven cooks great (broiled some hotdogs)! I\u2019m hoping to see a great savings in my electric bill. I\u2019ll keep you posted!\n \n  Compact, simple and heats up quickly.  Does not toast without a selecting a temperature, toast feature and time. \n  To use the Toast function you have to use all 3 dials.  It requires you to pick an oven temperature for toast.  I've never had to do that on previous toaster ovens I've owned.  The writing for each function is very small so I had a hard time figuring out what setting I needed to be on.  Also, it would be nice if a tray or pan came with it other than just the grill rack.\n \n  Watch food carefully...can burn fast.....Go a little lower in temp.\n \n  The packaging was a bit tattered. There is a small dent on the top front of the toaster oven. This does not affect the working mechanism.  It's taken me a few trial and errors but I am finding this works quite well. I've baked several items, including fish and it has worked out perfectly. It is the perfect size for the area of my counter between the range and the pantry. It is easy to clean.\n ", "\n  It is very difficult to regulate temperature when baking.  I would say it is virtually impossible.  My previous convection oven was wonderful.  This one is mostly a toaster.  Extremely disappointed.  I will be replacing it. Unfortunately I am sure I am am unable to return this.\n \n  This is a very standard almost like an old school over.  It loud when the timer goes off (loud ding, it says multi function but I do not see using this thing for anything other than toasting.\n \n  I love my new Mueller Toaster Oven \n  I recently had my kitchen remodeled, and wanted a nice looking toaster oven for my countertop. His toaster oven looks nice and worked well when I made frozen bagels for breakfast recently.\n \n  All good except for the \u201ctick tick tick tick \u201c while it\u2019s counting down. It\u2019s SO irritating!!! If you have 10 minutes set, it\u2019s ticking away for 10 minutes. The DeLonghi we had before this one didn\u2019t have the ticking.\n \n  Love this toaster oven! We don't have a lot of counter space, so this is perfect - it doesn't take up a lot of room, but it does exactly what we need it to do. Make sure you open the windows when you first fire the oven up and burn off the chemicals. I was very nauseous from the scent of whatever was burning off of it.\n \n  I received this Toaster Oven in quick time and the packaging appeared intact, however the oven never turned on nor did the hearing mechanism work. I have attached a video to display this. \n  Font is very thin and black making it very difficult to read with the glare from the stainless steal ,  cooks very well but the temperature seems to be on the hot side of the control (it will burn things)  you will need to watch your cooking for a  while until you\u2019re used to the adjusted cook times/ temps.\n \n  This is the perfect toaster oven for the price.  It looks and feels well made pulling it out of the box.  The settings and controls are intuitive and easy to understand and the functionality is great.  I have tried many of the traditional \"toaster\" heated foods like toast and frozen waffles and it does a good job.  I checked the oven temperatures with thermometer against the setting temperatures and they were spot on.  I will  be on the look out for other appliances and/or products from this manufacturer and supplier.\n \n  it has been a month and  very satisfying...my previous toaster was burning the bread every time i  keep it a few seconds longer....this one is perfect ..even if i forget the bread slices in the oven, breads are toasted evenly...\n ", "\n  This toaster oven looks amazing in my kitchen, it\u2019s super modern looking! It\u2019s a great size where it does not take up too much space! I love that it has a 2 pan option rather than one! My toast was evenly browned! I also love the keep warm feature!\n \n  Do not buy this item. Mine is 6 months old and the door flops open. \n  Excellent toaster oven! The heat distribution among the food I've put in it so far has been even. So far I've used it for baking, broiling and toasting and it does an effective job. The toaster oven is a good size and it's also easy to clean.\n \n  Toasts evenly..it's great for small items like pizza and mozzarella sticks without using entire oven/wasting energy (and heating house in 96* weather is not an option)..fits on counter perfectly at 10\" deep and even cooks up hamburgers as well and healthier than the stove top.\n \n  No crazy bells and whistles. Just a nice basic toaster oven at a reasonable price. I like being able to cook without heating up the whole house. It's a great addition to my kitchen.\n \n  This unit is a replacement for a 10 year old toaster that finally died.  So far, it works great!  I have only used it for toast and it does a good job,  heat seems to be pretty evenly distributed.  The controls are clearly marked and easy \n  This isn't what I thought , I red others comments on here, I had different brand that was bit bigger and \n  A great choice.  This toaster oven is perfect for our needs.  Doesn't take up too much space on the counter.  It's easy to use.  Seems to heat evenly.  We don't need to heat up the entire kitchen to warm something up.  Highly recommended.\n \n  I have tried not too many toaster ovens before this one, so I can't actually compare it to others toaster ovens, but so far I can tell I am very satisfied with this one. I was a little bit confused about how to use all functions but when I realized it I can say that it is very easy to use every function. It looks magnificent in my kitchen, actually, it looks very expensive. Settings are manual which I really like, the timer goes up to 30 minutes and you can also choose to use it without time control. Size meets my needs.\n \n  Buttons are labeled, but very indistinctly etched on the metal. Toasting temps are not sufficient to brown a slice of bread. The top is darker than the bottom of the slice. ", "\n  I love that this toasts items, I always want my pizza or subs extra well done and this allows me to do so without cooking everything extra long. The tray is easy to clean even with melted cheese and bbq sauce on it. I threw my regular toaster in a cupboard and use this bad boy instead. Kids love that they can cook pizza rolls and bagels in it quickly too. No complaints and I dont see this moving off of my counter anytime soon.\n \n  We love our little toaster oven. We use it everyday for toast, heating up small about of food etc. My kids make grill cheese sandwiches and for the price you can't beat it. We don't need anything fancy but something functional which this toaster is. There isn't a crumb tray so I need to carefully hold it up to clean crumbs but I don't mind.  Unfortunately, the door had a little problem and I call customer services they couldn't have been more helpful. I highly recommend this toaster.\n \n  I was looking for a simple toaster oven (like one that a family friend had when I was a child). Looked at pricier ones, but decided to give this one a try and do not regret that decision! Very pleased with this little toaster oven! Not too big and does everything we need it to do with ease!\n \n  I am very pleased with this purchase. It has been very convenient to toast and warm small portions quickly without having to wait for the big oven to heat up. I really appreciate that it has a timer and temperature control so my food never burns. The kids have a blast making their own personal pizzas and watching through the glass. It makes them feel very accomplished and gives me the peace of mind that they don't run the risk of getting burned in the big oven.\n \n  Nice and compact perfect for supporting my Ketogenic diet....\n \n  The product came in perfect condition and was packaged very well. I like the appearance of the toaster oven and it is easy to use. I look forward to enjoying it in the years to come. Great value for the money!\n \n  Well made and performance meets the needs of my family. I use it mostly for reheating things that don't do well in microwave or when I don't want to bother using my full size oven.\n \n  I went to target and walmart  Because of COVID supply of toaster ovens are down, all the good ones are not available  I am Austrian by descent and have a Mueller French Press so I knew the quality and materials used would be top of the line  I was not diappointed  Tremendous heat capacity and design allows for even toasting  Setting the temp of the toaster to a range of intensities adjusts the quality of the toasting  Great product, better than any of the common chinese made ovens\n \n  In order to remove the crumb tray: \n  I just received my toaster oven yesterday. It looks sleek and has very easy to understand dials/knobs. So far I have only toasted a few pieces of toast, but it works great and toasts evenly. There is plenty of room inside the toaster oven that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to burn my hand as I remove my item. I feel that this will become a a much used item in my kitchen.\n ", "\n  The toast function, which is why I bought it doesn\u2019t work.  It starts and then just stops without completing.  If I set it past toast it will run fully, but very crispy.\n \n  I got this toaster oven for my office since it was compact enough to fit on top of my office mini fridge since I don't prefer heating my lunch in the microwave, so far it works as expected, now I pack my prepared sandwiches and just heat them inside coming all perfect and toasty :)\n \n  I don't like to heat up my oven when I can use a toaster oven.  I have never had one to last very long because I make things like meatloaf in mine.  It is on for an hour. I am still trying to fine one that lasts. I have used Black and Decker and others.\n \n  I have been wanting a toaster oven for quite some time so I finally broke down and bought one and I'm so happy I did! It is amazing! We have used it almost daily. It's perfect for reheating food. We put a little foil in the pan which makes for super easy clean up. Wish I would have bought it sooner!\n \n  Just got this, but was disappointed to find that although the product description and owner's manual said it had a removable crumb tray - it does not.  You have to lift up the toaster oven and open a hinged door to access the crumb tray.  Even though the manual says to soak bad spills, this is impossible.  You need to be able to wipe it off.  Too early to rate the other features.\n \n  I love this Toaster Oven it is sturdy and compact and fits nicely in my small kitchen. I am most pleased with how tightly the door shuts so the oven stays up to temp.\n \n  I got this product to free up the oven for bigger things and to also use in the warmer months without heating up the entire house. This toaster oven helped me achieve all that and also looks quite nice on my counter!\n \n  Really nice, better than I expected! I assumed it was all silver, but it's actually black and silver and it matches all my other appliances, which is awesome. \n  This toaster oven is far better than previous brands I have tried and returned.  While it tends to darken the toast on the under side slightly more than the top ( a common problem with all I have tried) this model is closer to even heating than any others..  It gets the toast done faster than any others too.\n \n  This is a GREAT little toaster oven. Warms up almost instantly and very economical for quick lunches & snacks etc. It's better suited for 2 slices of bread unless they are small slices. Shipping was fast and customer service is even faster! Great price great quality!\n ", "\n  I love this toaster oven.  This is a must have for a small kitchen and I love to use this when I don't want to heat up my house but want to cook something in the oven.\n \n  Just bought the product. Very nice packaging. Overall good quality for the price. A few things that noticed right from the get go. The knobs are plastic and one of them lost the silver coating in a few places on day one. Also the toaster overheats and you can feel a lot of heat being conducted from the top of the toaster. (Had a breville prior and was very cool on the top)\n \n  Does not toast, in my opinion. A toaster oven it is not.\n \n  Good toaster oven great for reheating food I was just disappointed when the hinge came off and the door wouldn\u2019t close anymore after 10 months. contacted customer service they immediately shipped me a new unit without me having to return the old one excellent customer service I will buy from them again!\n \n  Very nice toaster oven and works great.  Nice to find a reliable product that is not a name brand.  Sleek design,easy to read controls, and nice even heating and toasting functions.\n \n  Happy with the quality so far.  Not the best for making toast, but that's to be expected from a toaster oven.  Use the oven to cook chicken breasts and it came out great.  Seems to be built well for being under $50.\n \n  very small, and dials are a bit old fashioned she be simplified hard to take out the try as well but it technically does what a toaster oven is suppose to do.\n \n  This oven doesn't generate enough heat. I often roast vegetables in a toaster oven, and with my previous toaster oven the small cut veggies would take about ten minutes to cook, with this oven it takes a good 30 minutes. There are two baking elements --top and bottom--and only the bottom element heats up in baking mode, which may explain the low heat level \n  I like that is doesn't take up much space on the counter and it is sleek and well built. What I don't like is that the controls have very small print and some are grayed out which makes them very hard to read. I had to bend over and get up close to see them at all when i first got it. Knobs are still and hard to turn and it takes longer than i would expect (from a previous toaster/oven) to toast a piece of bread or muffin. Only used for toasting, no baking yet.\n \n  Good product!  One minor issue: very difficult to read dial print.  Had to get flashlight to read what was printed around dials.\n ", "\n  Easy to clean and operate, but the heat distribution is all over the place. Used every setting possible, but you either burn the top, bottom, or both sides.\n \n  I just bought this toaster oven and I am very, very disappointed with it. I have used it twice..first time was garlic bread and it turned out ok...second time made a meatloaf and the oven started smoking and the top burner started on fire! \n  I have had this for a few months and I love it. It crisps and toast so evenly with no burnt edges. Great for mini pizzas and anything that gets soggy in microwave.It does not take up much counter space which is a plus. Don't hesitate in buying.\n \n  As both an experiment and an effort to make more cookies for a bake sale at school, I figured I'd use this toaster oven to bake some cookies while the large oven was being taken up by another batch. It didn't disappoint in the process and got out some very good looking and crisp cookies. So, whenever I need to use the oven to a small extent, I'm going to instead opt for this toaster oven. That way, I save on gas and have an easier time handling everything.\n \n  We have only had this product for a couple days and we already love it! It does not take up a lot of space but gets the job done. The temperature control and heat distribution are perfect. Would definitely recommend!\n \n  This a a great little oven. Fairly compact, self-explanatory. Clean design. I have only made toast so far but it\u2019s so nice, I\u2019m going to give it to my daughter!\n \n  Bought for our office kitchen. It does the job we need but can\u2019t turn timer off if you finish warming sooner. \n  Cooks well. Do far we have toasted bagels and toast..great. It cooks well also. The only con for me is that the whole unit heats up. I wish there was a cool/neutral spot on the outside that doesn't get hot. Otherwise great!\n \n  Makes my daily breakfast routine way less of a chore! I'm not dreading getting up and having to toil in the kitchen for a couple of slices of toast, a bit of bacon, and coffee which does admittedly come out nicely. Instead, I can use this super versatile tool to get myself up on the right foot. The oven does all of the work for me. I just sit back and relax after having put most of what I needed breakfast in this toaster oven and get on with the rest of my morning routine.\n \n  It works! Word of caution: the outside of the door along the base gets insanely hot. I gave myself a decent 2nd degree burn because I brushed my hand up against it.\n ", "\n  Needed a toaster because I hate turning on the oven for bread and small things. I was supposed to get a free julienne peeler with it but it never arrived.\n \n  I love Mueller products!  They are great craftsmanship.  I have not had a problem with anything I've purchased.  This little oven has not disappointed!  Thanks so much for the great product!\n \n  Very satisfied with this good quality toaster oven. One person household, perfect size for small kitchen countertop. The temperature heats up quickly. Purchased for small cooking jobs like tuna melts and crisping foods. The only complaint I have is that the numbers on the dials are hard to read, used the instruction manual as a guide until I became familiar with the settings.\n \n  This oven is quite small.  The thing that bothers me the most is that it is almost impossible to read the controls.  The letters are sooooo small.  I wouldn't buy this again.\n \n  Disappointed in this product.  It can't even cook one pork chop.  If I could, I would have returned it, but it's been used.  Would not recommend it.\n \n  For the price, it's a good looking and durable toaster oven that will stay with you for years. The insides and outside are easy to clean and keep clean, and the toaster itself heats up fairly quickly when set to any temperature between 100 - 450 degrees. The convection feature makes it that every piece of food you have no matter on what tray position it's in is cooked well through and is depending on what mode you use it one, either crispy or not.\n \n  I love it. Does not take up too much space on the countertop. Cooks evenly the timer control is very handy Kitchen stays cooler. GREAT product. would buy it again. Great seller. A+++\n \n  I have had this oven for 2 months, and I use it every day. I no longer need my microwave for anything but popping popcorn. I prefer heating up leftovers in the mini oven, my sandwiches come out toasted and with melted cheese inside. It's a real game changer. My mornings have been so much better ever since I started heating up my sandwiches in it while I get ready for work. Having a warm meal every morning is the best thing to prep me for the day.\n \n  When I moved to my new apartment, I realized I needed a new toaster oven. This one is so nice and matches the rest of my kitchen appliances. It doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter, but it does the job of a huge oven. I love the fact that I don't need to waste energy to heat up the big oven or accidentally burning my food. Once the food is done, the timer goes off and it keeps the food warm until I am ready to get it out. Perfect for my on the go lifestyle.\n \n  We needed a new toaster at work so I figured I would buy this and give it a try! I love how it\u2019s spacious inside but doesn\u2019t take up a ton of counter space (smaller footprint than our OLD one, but more room inside) and it works great! Everyone at my store is super happy with my purchase and I\u2019m happy to have this quality toaster around for many years to come!\n ", "\n  I used it to make oatmeal cookies and it was super fast and easy process!! Will sure come in handy for future use. I will say it does steam the higher the heat and heat distribution could be better (hotter at the back) but other than that. It was great.\n \n  How can this be listed as convection?  There is no fan and it is not marked as a convection oven.  There is nothing in the instructions referring to convection.\n \n  Lo amo!!!! I set it up and use it the same day I received it. My wife and I are totally satisfied with this oven. I know visitors are going to ask about it.\n \n  I just got this toaster oven and am really happy with how well made it is. The controls seem easy to use. It heats up very quickly. It\u2019s a good size also.\n \n  Why this toaster oven does have a good amount of functionality for the price point, it's not fancy and won't be doing a bunch of crazy things besides baking, broiling, toasting, and keeping food warm, which are more than adequate. It takes longer than an actual oven to cook things in here since there isn't as much insulation as a larger oven but it's only a ten-minute difference which is negligible if you plan right.\n \n  For a smaller toaster oven, color me impressed. The trays are sturdy while not too stain or residue resistant as I'd like but that can be taken care of with a bit of aluminum foil each time I use it. The heating elements also do a good just at heating the toaster oven evenly throughout and willie I don't understand the concept of convection, I think it's cool.  my food is much more evenly cooked than with my old toaster.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Burn away the assumed electronics insulation that wants to burn first 3 minutes off use, then it will be good from there.\n \n  The rack or grate does not fit snugly into the grooves and will collapse when used in the bottom position.  The knobs are slick and round, and if your fingers are wet or oily, it's hard to get enough traction to turn them.  The toasting degree indicator is unreliable; you have to keep an eye on the toast and keep adjusting.  I go through a lot of toaster ovens.  I think I'll go back to Black & Decker.\n \n  controls work great-compact size with 1100 watts cooks fast- not easy to clean-can't remove crumb tray- door hinge is fragile ( not for heavy use)- unfortunately the door hinges broke within 6 months and I had to toss in the garbage\n \n  The oven heats up quickly and evenly. It is stylish and fits nicely on the counter; not too big. Knobs are responsive and the tray is a good size.\n ", "\n  So far this product is great. Bought it as a replacement for my grandma whose home is the center of our family with 12 children 36 grandchildren 10 + great grand children and one great great grandchild.  We very one in the family of a constantly using the toaster oven when they visit so it really needs to be sturdy so far works great.\n \n  I like the small size; it does not take up much room on the counter.  That's the good.  What i don't like is that while there is a toast setting, there is no guidance on the temperature required to toast.  Pretty simple thing that should be included in the instructions.  Other than that , it's pretty good.  I'm still trying to get the right setting.\n \n  I bought this as a gift for a new homeowner, and she tells me she is really pleased with it, thinks it's an excellent choice.  Sorry no more details at this point.\n \n  I love the ease of operation, it\u2019s simplicity and it\u2019s attractiveness. I use it for all kinds of things - toast, veggie sausage, small pizzas.\n \n  I can't figure out all the great reviews.  We have had this for 2 weeks and it consistently burns the toast on the bottom.  I have adjusted the temperature setting and the toast setting.  We also tried heating up and broiling chicken nuggets.  After that when we used it there was a lot of smoke.  This never happened with our previous toaster.  We are disappointed and unfortunately will be returning.\n \n  This was bought as a christmas gift.  I bought it because the tebiews i went thru indicated it was a better brand than the one I considered.\n \n  Very slick, easy to use , I've been putting it to work everyday since I got it as the cafeteria at my work is still closed. Breakfast and lunch each day - saving money and eating healthier!\n \n  Product information as described.  Shipping packing was exceptional. \n  I love this little oven! I wished it was bigger though. I thought it would be big enough to put a 12\u201d pizza in but unfortunately no. \n  Do not like having to tilt up the oven to clean out the crumb tray.  This way the crumbs fall out onto the counter.  It would be better to have a slide-out crumb tray.\n ", "\n  I like the toaster, and the features it offers. The bake, broil and toast...with 2 different levels to place the bake rack for prefered height especially when broiling since the heat is on top.\n \n  In my delivery, I got a nice little toaster oven that I'm actively coming up with more and more creative meals to make with. This is a good toaster oven for those of you who are alone as of now and don't feel like doubling your monthly gas bill by using the oven for just one person. The food comes out well cooked but since it takes a little longer than normal ovens to heat up, I would adjust prep and expected cook time appropriately.\n \n  Love this product came in big handy did not have a regular oven kitchen was getting remodeled so I cook all meals out of the toaster oven\n \n  Solid construction, heats quickly. Slightly slower than a toaster but once you learn the settings makes toast the same every time. Plus its useful for heating up or even cooking smaller items.\n \n  After looking for a new toaster oven I decided to go with this one it seemed to have good reviews. So far I\u2019m loving it. It\u2019s not so big but has plenty space inside. Fits nice on my small counter. And very easy to clean. I would recomend\n \n  It has a good size to put a pizza in it but the drip pan in it not as my expectation but yeah if they do have a drip pan that is really removable it will be better the cord too it's not too long but overall great buy for the price of it ^_^\n \n  I like that this is such a compact size, but still able to fit enough items in for serving sizes. It has allowed me to have more Much needed counter space!\n \n  The unit never heated, has complicated settings and made using a toaster oven a headache for the first time in my life.  I have owned many different brands over more than 50 years of marriage and this one was so unfriendly, I returned it the next day.  I shouldn\u2019t have to spend days trying to figure out how to make it work.\n \n  The toaster oven seems fine, but I \n  I had to return this toaster because it did not fit my 9\" pizza pan, but the description said it would.  It did look like a good product though for those with different needs.\n ", "\n  I haven't found anything yet that I dislike about the product. Price was reasonable, performs well.  I really have enjoyed my problem free addition to our kitchen!!\n \n  This was a great addition to my kitchen counter. The design is modern and with the brushed chrome, it matches the rest of my appliances. I am happy that it feels well made and not cheap like previous ovens I have had. I am excited to begin enjoying a warm breakfast even when I am in a rush in the morning to get to work. I like the convenience of the timer that turns off and keeps my food warm until I am ready to get it out.\n \n  I like this toaster oven it works great and I recommended to anyone my only complaint is the size I was used to the one I had before which was a little bit bigger if you have a family of 3 or more people I will recommend the one where you can accommodate 6 slices of bread but everything else is good. I\u2019m very satisfied with the product.\n \n  So far I am loving how easy and convenient this toaster oven is. I was able to cook a personal pan pizza in it and tasted great, thoroughly cooked. It's only my husband and me at home, so using the big oven seems like such a waste. I made a loaf of banana bread in it too. I think it's even better than using the regular oven since I can set the timer and temp, it turns off when done and lets me know with a loud enough peep.\n \n  I ordered this to replace an old toaster oven. I love the compact size of it. It is also very lightweight but well made. The appearance is professional looking. It is easy to clean and operate. Price is well worth it.\n \n  I like everything about this toaster oven, except the crumb tray....for some reason they made it so it non removable, so you have to lift the oven, open crumb tray and brush crumbs out, a bit of a pain...other than that everything's great !!\n \n  I love how it is compact enough for my small counters but yet is still able to cook many number of meals for my family of 3. And I can cook several bagels and waffles at a time. It\u2019s very versatile\n \n  Works well, wish it had a bagel setting for one side but put on broil same thing last oven had the setting. Happy with it performs well.\n \n  I'm confused why this product is so highly-reviewed and remains an \"Amazon's Choice\" \n  Love this oven. Very fast to heat up, even heat. Toasted bread great without drying out the bread.\n ", "\n  I ordered this toaster oven for my new apartment. I needed something small, minimal and stylish yet affordable and this seem to fit my objectives. I'm surprised to learn of this European brand. I just used the toaster today and I really liked how it worked. The no-fuss manual dials are great vs. something digital.\n \n  Very pleased with this toaster oven.  The size is great,  Heats up fast and the outside of the oven is not hot, which is very important when children are around.  Great value for the money!  I recommend it.\n \n  Not the worlds best toaster. Toasting takes a long time and isn\u2019t terribly even. The oven function works great but if you\u2019re looking for a toaster this is not it.\n \n  The control knobs of this toaster oven are easy enough to set to what you want and the timer's ticking isn't loud enough to bother you. It shuts off when it's set to. The material is stainless except for the sides which do make it a little less stylish but it's not a deal-breaker and they did have to make some concessions in an effort to add other more useful features like convection and four different cooking modes.\n \n  Always wanted to purchase a toaster oven but had no great knowledge of them. so I thought I would try this one.and I fell in love. I use it all the time.\n \n  I  I did not like the knobs on the toaster plus the toaster was  too small and I did not like anything about the toaster oven . I called the number that was in the book  that came with  The toaster oven and the name is Home universe and they told me that Amazon would refund my money and I did not have to send it back very much like to hear from you about the situation I have the number from Home universe if you would like it my email is  BROGAN 55@comcast.net thank you very much  Mary and Kane\n \n  Didn't want to spend to much for toaster oven to toast bagels & bread. This was perfect price for me. A little bigger than I would like, but works well.\n \n  I have had a Cuisinart Toaster Oven for 10 years.  When it finally died I was uncertain whether to buy one again or try a new brand.  After reading all the reviews I decided to buy the Mueller brand.  When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  Half the price with all of the same features.  It is an excellent choice.\n \n  This is by far the best toaster oven I have ever owned! It toasts anything I want extremely well and evenly. The temperature setting is perfect and it looks so sleek and clean in my kitchen. I like that it is spacious and can hold more than two things at once. I love that it is stainless steel, too. It makes for a better quality oven. I am very happy with this purchase and I know that it will last me years to come.\n \n  The instructions do not give a temperature setting for toast.  How am I supposed to know how hot/cold to set it for toast????\n ", "\n  This toaster oven is small, but mighty, cooks faster then your oven so you need to keep an eye out. I roasted a cut up chicken and it came out really good. Toasts bread, bagals and English muffins evenly. Easy to clean, with a pull out tray. This is a sturdy unit that does not take up a large amount of space on your counter. Great for heating up leftovers and avoiding using the oven. I love this little powerhouse?\n \n  Beautiful stainless steel toaster oven- fits perfectly in our small office kitchenette.  Now finally, we can bring raw foods/ good from home and get a more \u201clike home\u201d baking and broiling experience, without the constant \u201cmicrowaveable experience\u201d. Love it!!\n \n  This is very clean looking in detail and sits on the counter top nicely without taking up a bunch of room. I have already cooked a few different things in it and am happy with its performance\n \n  The bad thing about buying things sight unseen on the internet is that the details of operating a small appliance like this are unknown until you open the box. The timer on this machine is terrible. There is no preset for toasting, just a knob that you turn to a very \u201capproximate\u201d setting- so every time out, it\u2019s a crapshoot.  I\u2019ll be returning this and buying something like I had before, which has a preset time & temp for toasting.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space and it\u2019s super easy to use. Also Mueller gives a percentage of your purchase to help those in crisis situations get back on their feet and they help troubled youth via the Youth Opportunity Center. Love companies that give back.\n \n  Toasted perfect set at 450. It\u2019s the perfect size, for what I wanted. Didn\u2019t get crazy hot on the outside like other brands. So far so good.\n \n  When we 1st received, this toaster oven operated fairly well. Now, less than 5 months later, the top element is shot and the bottom element burns everything!  Do not buy!\n \n  I have not been disappointed by the Mueller brand yet and this toaster is nothing to differ. This works as well as my previous mini oven that was twice as expensive as this. The old toaster oven's element broke and forced me to get this one which I'm in hindsight happy about. The analog clock limits setting the time always being good but it's still effective and a couple of seconds here and there is no problem.\n \n  The Mueller toaster oven is fairly large on the inside while also having a sleek and compact signature that won't get in the way of the rest of your kitchen by taking up too much space. It's sleek and well designed and on a happy coincidental note is the same color as my dishwasher, fridge, and toaster so it looks at home in my kitchen even more. I'm really happy with this toaster's ease of use and versatility.\n \n  The title of that review makes it sound like it's scorchingly negative but I mean that in a positive way. What you're getting isn't a flimsy and cheap feeling toaster oven but a toaster oven that will last through a couple of drops that are inevitable and still work great! It's a sturdy design that has a bunch of features, nothing crazy difficult to figure, that don't come with other ovens at this price point.\n ", "\n  my oven quit working....during the pandemic. so i ordered this on  Amazon. works great and i don't have to heat my oven.\n \n  The toaster oven does even more than I was expecting. It also bakes, broils & roasts. The size is perfect. It is on the smaller side which is what I was looking for. The design is stylish & modern. It is easy to use all of the functions.\n \n  Love everything about this toaster oven!  Perfect countertop size. Sturdy construction. \n  My toast gets toasted on the underneath side but not the top. This oven smokes when I make toast. Very scary\n \n  Happy with the toaster. I had not had such a good toaster for a long time.\n \n  I love the looks because It looks fancy! Oven is a perfect size for a small kitchen. It heats the food fast and the heat is well distributed.\n \n  I dont like it. Does not cook food evenly.\n \n  Items arrived in timely manner.  Small but powerful machine and also fits perfectly on kitchen counter.  One improvement is a power off button or dial added.\n \n  I love the compact size, fits on my counter and i also love the different ways to heat,  toast and bake. Very well put together also. I would definitely recommend this item.\n \n  It's a nice and nifty tool to have if you're like me and just want to heat yourself up to something when working from home and don't need the extra hassle but can appreciate a nice looking appliance that your wife isn't totally against you having a hand in buying. It looks good in the kitchen, matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen and works well enough to become a staple in my family's food routine.\n ", "\n  This is a great little toaster oven. The controls are simple, the size is perfect, it\u2019s short enough to be under cabinets, it\u2019s deep enough to hold 4 slices. All good.\n \n  Very small for the price. Half the size I was expecting.  Ok for toast I guess, but not much space for anything else.\n \n  It was difficult to set any kind of temperature and time to cook toast which was the most basic of options. Because that would be the most frequent use,  I could not move past that issue.  I did not try any other settings and returned it. \n  What a great little gadget this is. It does everything a regular oven does and more. I am thrilled that I can get the perfect grilled cheese sandwich in only minutes. My kids are into melted cheese in their sandwiches as of late. I am happy I can throw some in the over while I get them ready for school. It gives me the peace of mind that they have a good breakfast on their way to school every morning.\n \n  After only having it for about 2 years, my last mini toaster died and I needed a more reliable replacement. So far this has been an amazing replacement. Works great and heats up food in a jiffy. I can heat up just about anything, which is convenient since I hate using the microwave. I actually use it to heat up my personal frozen pizza better than the regular oven. It is so much easier and I love it!!\n \n  I wanted something that I could place a Pizza in, something big enough so that i would not have to use my over.  My fault, bad buy\n \n  Finally, a toaster oven that doesn\u2019t take up a huge chunk of real estate on the kitchen counter! Great, good looking, toaster oven that has easy to use controls. Just what I was looking for!\n \n  Very nice design!!  It cooks evenly and is very easy to operate.  Comes nicely packaged, all you have to do is plug it in!!\n \n  Looks big in pic, the woman in this house says size really does matter, she could not see getting any satisfaction from the small maching\n \n  This is really lightweight and just okay. Was expecting more from a European toaster oven. It\u2019s OK but I wouldn\u2019t order it again not give it as a gift.\n ", "\n  I've used a lot of toasters from college to now, and each one broke before. My last toaster's door suddenly stopped closing all the way. This time, I bought a Mueller toaster and it functions incredibly well. There are 3 knobs to control bake, broil, and toast, and having these 3 settings all separated is very convenient. The design is sleek and clean. I like it a lot and will be ordering a second one for my office.\n \n  We are a small family and using the big oven is a kind of energy waste when we bake a small amount of food. I did some research and found out this one. It looks very space saving and the design looks very simple and elegant. After I received and used it for a couple of times, I really like it! It is very easy to use, and the heating up is very fast. It meets most of our baking needs! Energy saving and space saving\u2019\n \n  It is almost impossible to read the logos on the dial or the temperatures, etc.  It works like a toaster oven should, once you can figure out the symbols.  VERY BAD design defect!\n \n  Our old one died I love that the controls are manual less that can go wrong. Use it all the time probably our most used appliance. Easy to clean.\n \n  It fits my small counter space perfectly- see width measurement in photo. When baking French fries or anything we want crispy, we use the \u201ctoasting\u201d setting so the heat elements for top and bottom are both on. \n  My best lil gadget in my kitchen. The cooking area is actually not that big, but its perfect for me. It heats up in like 3 minutes up to 400\u00b0 but my kitchen never heats up. It has a timer, so you dont need to watch it ever second. I'm very happy with this teeny oven. Toast, burgers, steak, chicken, sausages, what ever you need...as long as it can fit inside.\n \n  Smaller than what you imagine.  1 light bulb burner in the bottom and 1 on top.  The door very flimsy and doesnt have anything to stop when you close it so it closes hard and noisy.  Needed some sort of rubber stop.  Also be careful, it gets hot but I think that's with all smaller ovens as ive experience in the past.\n \n  I\u2019ve owned two other airfryers this by far is the best. The fact that I can turn it up so it doesn\u2019t take up all the counter space is a huge plus! Love the larger tray. I\u2019ve cooked 9 chicken breast at one time! Love all the different options! Way to go. I would recommend to others.\n \n  I used it for the first time today and I think it is an excellent toaster oven. Very well manufactured and heats super fast. It has the advantage of being a convection oven that greatly reduces energy consumption.\n \n  This toaster oven has been a great help in my kitchen. I love having reheated pizza in it, nothing like a soggy pizza from the microwave. It's super easy to make any type of sandwich and have the surprise of melted cheese inside. I like that I can set the temperature and time so that my food never burns. The only downside is that It only fits 3 sandwiches if you squish them. I wish it fit 4.\n ", "\n  Very pleased and satisfied with the product Muller Toaster Oven including performance (fast) , size and stainless steel sleek look. \n  This is a great toaster oven!  Beautifully designed, the top doesn't get super hot while cooking and easy to use!\n \n  The door on this toaster oven has broken several times since we purchased it. First, the spring that holds the door closed slipped off the pin it's hooked to several times. Now the bracket that attaches that spring to the door slips off the door nearly every time the door is opened. I've taken the cover off to fix it at least 8 times. It's now going in the trash. Other than that, it worked fine.\n \n  Fits our need for a basic toaster. Relatively compact and simple controls. The timer is an old school analog counter with a bell at the end.\n \n  We have been very dissatisfied with this toaster oven.  the knobs are very difficult to read (ie, toast vs. bake) and it heats very unevenly.  you have to watch anything you put in it constantly to prevent burning.  we will replace it soon.\n \n  Disappointed at best...I found the knobs were not as descriptive of the settings as they should have been. When looking to toast, I could not tell what setting I was on because it is a large square with no indicator or arrow. So I either got very light toast or burnt. There is always a plume of smoke when I toast.  I am very leery of baking and/or broiling. I wouldn't know what to expect.\n \n  We thought this would be better than the old 2 or 4 slice toaster but it\u2019s not. It takes a long time to cook anything.  Might as well throw it in the oven. Doesn\u2019t heat evenly either. Thanks\n \n  i like the overall look and design of this Austrian unit.. It is not cheap looking like things mfg'd. in the states. It costs a bit more than a toaster oven would here (in US) but if you don't want to replace your appliances every year you'll love this \n  Bought two of these toasters as gifts so I can't comment on features. I bought this particular toaster oven because of it size.\n \n  There are a lot of people out there with the creativity to do very interesting things with their toaster ovens and make truly unique meals but me, I just use this for the usual breakfast stuff and it works wonderfully in that arena. I get my toast browned evenly throughout and don't need to turn it over and risk burning my hands. The handle's fairly well insulated and it heats up quick.\n ", "\n  I bought this to add to my morning routine (and pizza baking). It takes up a lot of space on the counter, but makes up in functionality. I burned a grilled cheese on the first day, but it was easy to clean. The oven heats up really fast. Useful and convenient, but make sure you have enough counter space.\n \n  Great little toaster oven. I like the extra height inside this one. And the 2 tray levels. Using it on my boat!\n \n  Larger capacity than other toaster ovens. The big glass door allows you to see all your food while it's cooking.  Easy to remove the crumb catcher too. Great product!\n \n  I love that this is entirely stainless steel! It\u2019s a nice upgrade from my half plastic, half stainless steel one. This is roomy and looks nice just leaving on my counter top. These are  a must for the kitchen. I love this company too! They give a free gift with every product.\n \n  I just got it so haven\u2019t really been able to see the cooking results with temperature control and ease of cleaning  but really enjoy the Function settings.... particularly that the toast option heats Top and bottom. I like that the exterior is compact so saves counter top space and appears that the inside is not compromised. I didn\u2019t see a drop pan so  suggestion for the future models.\n \n  It took a few tries to get used to this toaster oven. The toaster oven gets really hot and I'm finding that I need a lower temperature or less cooking time than what cooking instructions recommend to avoid burning my food. It is still super convenient and beats having to pre-heat a full sized oven. The broil function does a good job melting cheeses or adding a slight crunch to my food.\n \n  I liked the fact that the unit heated up quickly.  It was very powerful and took a few times to get the temp right.\n \n  Knowing a toaster oven can range from 25 bucks to over 100, I figured I would go with something in the middle. No regrets! It's a great unit with lots of adjustments. Replaces my 20 year-old proctor silex whose cable was getting too hot during operation. \n  Simple, basic, no frills, uncomplicated. Compact design with small footprint allows use in limited space. Still haven't figured out how to remove crumb tray for cleaning.\n \n  Leftovers are easy enough to heat up evenly and thoroughly with the help of this toaster oven. You get a good amount of heat coming off of this toaster oven which isn't too great since heat loss makes it heat up much more slowly but it still gets up there in temperature in a good amount of time. The handle does get hot but not too hot that you'd burn yourself ever even when the thermostat is set at 400.\n ", "\n  This is your basic easy to use a convection toaster oven that has a lot of capacity (Can heat half a pizza at the same time). The timer shuts off when it should and is easy enough to set and the knobs aren't wobbly. The temperature goes up to 450 degrees so there is a lot that can be cooked in this. It has been a lot more convenient than needing to turn on the big oven for small meals\n \n  This is a great toaster oven. Perfectly toasts 4 slices of bread. Easy to read and use control knobs. Compact and does not take up too much space on countertop!!\n \n  Easy to use, ample space inside. Stylish. Much better than my last toaster oven. A positive upgrade!\n \n  Works perfect, was a little concerned with the knobs getting the temperature correct but is not an issue at all. Love the tiers and the ability to have multiple trays. For the price, this couldn\u2019t be better. Thank you!\n \n  As this was a gift, I don't have much feedback other than she liked the size for her small apartment.\n \n  This Toaster Oven is Beautiful and it heats up very quickly which makes my life a lot easier. I am super pleased with it so far and excited to try cooking some of the bigger items I couldn\u2019t cook in my other Toaster Oven because it took forever to heat up and didn\u2019t cook evenly.\n \n  This is a feature-rich and sleek looking oven that is at home in any house with a modern motif. I can toast, bake, and broil to my liking with this oven and I'm really happy that I went through with the purchase. The two rows of racks let you position what you're heating up or cooking so that it's either away or near the source of heat so you actually get to decide which side is the more crispy side\n \n  Had to send back. Arrived with a misaligned door, would not close properly\n \n  I had never heard of Mueller until this purchase . Will definitely try more products by this company\n \n  Good oven, not much to it. It looks great in my kitchen and I save tons since I barely use my big oven. As a single guy, I barely cook but anytime I want to heat something up, I use it. The color is great as well and it is durable. Honestly my favorite thing to make is pizza, and I can get me a nice personal size pizza made in 20 minutes. Came with a few cool recopies that I will eventually get to.\n ", "\n  The toaster oven was a gift for my daughter.  We open the box and turned the toaster on. It smoked but I think its just that new first time turning on. The size was perfect.  She really liked it.\n \n  Sturdy but lightweight. Easy to use, heats up quickly and cools down quickly, too. Very efficient.\n \n  The appliance functions as described in product description, all features work and the appliance fits perfectly on my countertop. The appliance looks nice in my modern kitchen also. Shipping was fast and met the Christmas deadline.\n \n  Going to return. Cannot back or toast without the bottom burning.  I've tried using lower temperature  and does the same.  Yesterday was the last straw.  The bottom burner caught on fire.\n \n  The nicest toaster oven I've seen in a long time. I like the compact size, my kitchen is small and it does not take up a lot of cabnet space. I like the dial better than the digital. The only thing I would change is the symbols are small and hard to read. Have to get real close to see them, other than that it's a very nice product. I would buy again.\n \n  When I used it there was a burned plastic smell that I thought was going to go away but it didn't. It does not cook evenly and every time I try to bake something the bottom get burned and the top is left uncooked. Also when I tried using the broiling function smoke started coming out.\n \n  Alot smaller than I actually thought it would be. Overall it's a good unit, but I am disappointed with the amount of cooking space.\n \n  Smaller footprint than our old toaster oven, leaving more counter space. Toasts quickly for a toaster oven. There are reveiwea that it's hard to use the toast function but its not difficult and is basically the same as our previous toaster oven in terms of how it works. Not unusual or hard to use\n \n  it's smaller than i expected, but will still do what i need it to do, which is toast bread and small baking jobs. i'm still getting used to the buttons. but i like the oven.\n \n  I finally got my oven and followed the \"before first use\" instructions -TO THE LETTER- but within 5 minutes on the toast function the heating element stopped working and wouldnt turn back on. Total waste of money.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s small and light weight but it heats fast and doesn\u2019t radiate the heat I thought it would\n \n  I love how fast my new toaster oven heats up but also has variable settings to keep things from burning which is why I don\u2019t use my main kitchen oven.\n \n  I bought this for my Mother in law and she loves it. It does everything she needs and looks great on her countertop.\n \n  We were looking for a smaller toaster over that would not take-up a lot of counter space and this was the perfect fit! Instructions easy to follow, heated before first use and no smoke, slight odor. Has multi-use options but we've only used the toast option as of now. Would have preferred a slide-out crumb tray but was not a deal-breaker for me. Very happy with this purchase.\n \n  NIce tall toaster oven that I found others did not provide. \n  It evenly cooked foods.\n \n  Good little oven but if they offer a $10 gift card for a review it won\u2019t come to fruition\n \n  This product - regardless of description - DOES NOT HAVE A REMOVABLE CRUMB TRAY.  On top of all that, the middle rack doesn't have a \"stop\" so it comes flying out with your food and is a floor and foot hazard.  Heats unevenly...Buns not toasted on top, burnt on the bottom.  Price may be attractive but this is NOT the toaster oven for you if you need it to be functional.\n \n  Absolutely loved how it toasted my French bread to perfection. \n  Ordered due to space limitations. Very pleased with the size, weight and functionality of this toaster oven, works very well and the most important part is My Wife\u2019s Approves \ud83d\ude00\n ", "\n  Great toaster oven. Impressive fit and finish; adequate functions; clean design: compact and perfect for the counter. Toasting and baking well controlled with good results. Fine product for the price.\n \n  It works fine and it's not too bad to clean. Please note...if you turn the timer knob too far, you can't turn it back very easily, so you have to be very careful when setting the timer.\n \n  I\u2019ve had my toaster oven a few months now and I love it. It\u2019s very user friendly and with the way I work I\u2019m not able to cook much so its definitely helping me in that area. Thanks so much stay blessed and be safe. \n  This is a stylish oven and it has a study feel to it. It works well and is quite nice for the money\u2014a good buy.\n \n  It seems like a very nice toaster oven but it didn\u2019t fit our space so had to return it.\n \n  I am usually only cooking for myself and using my oven is a pain, so I decided to purchase this toaster oven for my small, individual meals. So far, it has worked amazingly. All of my meals come out tasting like it was cooked in a real oven whether it is pizza or chicken. It fits perfectly in my kitchen and isn't too bulky, but powerful enough to heat up my food in an efficient manner.\n \n  Descent size over toaster for everyday use. Its stainless steel and LED light make it look like a premium product in your kitchen. I used it used about everyday mostly for breakfast and lunch. Put a few slices of bread in the morning to heat them up and for lunch I use it to warm up pasta, rice, and mixed vegetables. Very satisfied with the product!\n \n  Only used it a couple times so far but it was easy to set up and use. So far it\u2019s been exactly what I wanted and I\u2019m excited to try some of the recipes  that it came with. \n  Definitely good value for money. I thought it will be a little bit big for my kitchen because it's a small kitchen, but it fits perfectly. Good value for money. I love this multi-function idea! A great addition to my kitchen. All functions works  well and it's very easy to clean it up. I am very satisfied with this toaster oven, it is very functional. Heats up fast.\n \n  Been in the market for a stainless steel toaster oven to match my kitchen and for the size and price point this one is perfect! Heats food great and is an amazing addition to my kitchen.\n ", "\n  Only had this for two days, but so far impressed with the quality and even toasting, both better than the Black and Decker Toast R Oven we had for years (although the Mueller is more expensive).  Toasting is generally the weak link for toaster ovens, so that is good.  The controls are just fine, in contrast to other reviews, and it looks pretty good on the countertop.\n \n  I have not had this over long enough to know. \n  Great smaller toaster oven for a rental I have- nice compact design.  When the door latch broke after I had it over a year,  I called customer service and they sent me a new unit immediately.  Now that is good service!\n None None None \n  \u00a0I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It looks very sturdy and like it would hold up well.  She began using it on 1/2/2020 and on 1/10/2020 this happened, see video.  Very dissappointed.  Trying to fugure out how to return it.\n \n  This oven surpasses my wildest thoughts.  It is easier to use because it has a timer. \n  I was looking for a regular toaster that I could use for reheating breads and making pizza. I don\u2019t understand much about the technology behind it, I just needed something sturdy that will serve me for many years. It works well so far, but again, I only use it to make bread toasts. Hope this helps!\n \n  My last toaster oven was such a pain, I could never use it for toast because I would have one side toasted way too much. I ended up buying a toaster for bread, which cluttered my kitchen. After I bought this toaster oven, I can make toast and not have to worry about flipping it.  Cooks everything else really well and tastes better than using the microwave for me.\n \n  I love this toaster oven so much! It has so many features that other ovens do not have and it does everything very well. The temperature settings are great and allow me to toast or bake many food items. I also really appreciate the fact that it is not obnoxiously large so it fits well in my kitchen. All in all, this toaster oven is small, powerful, and effective.\n \n  A very well made and easy to use oven that comes with two trays, one that is meant to catch crumbs and one that can hold your food. The toaster is pretty easy to clean as well not only because of the crumb tray but also because of the fingerprint-resistant exterior and the interior that makes it pretty hard for food stuff to get stuck to the sides and the inside.\n \n  This appliance is great.  I saved me time and energy.  Very easy to operate and clean. I love it!\n ", "\n  Have only made one thing in it so far so can't give it a higher rating , but the instructions do not tell you where or how the crumb tray is supposed to be used. Took lots of turning the oven around to figure out that there was a crumb tray included. It seems like it will not be easy to empty it.\n \n  The dials are impossible to read, the oven didn\u2019t work, I called customer service and they sent me a return label.\n \n  Works fine just takes a bit long to heat up and smaller than expected. Looks cool.\n \n  Hard to clean.  Crumb tray does not detach.  Hot exterior surfaces will burn you.\n \n  I got this to cook pizzas and chicken nuggets without turning on an oven. Cooks nuggets quickly, and makes them nice and crunchy. I was able to fit half a pizza on the tray. Also doesn\u2019t heat up the whole kitchen.\n \n  Such a great convection oven!  Very easy to use and so much more convenient than using a stove or larger appliance.  It fits under my kitchen cabinets.  I could not be happy for the value!! Would highly recommend!\n \n  Great price and smaller compact size for tight spots. Works incredibly well and easy to clean and use.\n \n  This company was quick to replace the toaster oven that had a hinge break off.  The replacement didn't work AT ALL.  Heater bar would heat up occasionally, no sense to it, but wouldn't ever get  hot enough to toast bread. I would now like a free refund.\n \n  A little smaller than i expected, but works great. Just have to put on my glasses to see the temp settings and such.\n \n  But oven door has broken with moderate use. ", "\n  THE TOASTER OVEN IS WELL BUILT. IT HAS GREAT HEAT DISTRIBUTION. A LITTLE SMALL.\n \n  This is a great product. It's small and doesn't take up much space yet it does so much. Great to make toast or beagles they dont get stuck . Heats up left over pizza and its not soggy. And i don't need to turn the big oven on.\n \n  Its compact and easy to operate. Like any good tool you have to get familiar with the operation. The instructions should emphasize this more.\n \n  I totally love this item!! Compact and sturdy!! Lots of functionality!!! Thanks\n \n  Heats up fast, toast evenly. I like the bell signal when my food is done.  Looks like  better construction than the last toaster. \n  I was looking for a suitable toaster oven to replace my old one and after much research, I decided on this one. My old toaster oven had finally died on me after only 2 years of owning it. I had barely even used it on top of that! I've been using this new Mueller toaster oven for about a month and I'm very pleased with my purchase. Cooks food perfectly and just as I like it.\n \n  We are so happy with this product!!!! Easy to use, lots of options.... great for our busy family!!!\n \n  Waited a couple months to leave a review. This is a great unit for the price. Although some may think it\u2019s a bit small it works for small families.\n \n  I love the design of the product and it fits on my counter perfectly without taking up too much space. It is super easy to use with its 3 knobs controlling the temperature, type of cooking, and a timer. It\u2019s great for cooking when you don\u2019t want to use your oven and it\u2019s supper convenient for reheating foods. I love the product and would highly recommend!\n \n  Very easy to use for cooking fish, harsh brown and toast! I like the temparature switch since it shows fahrenheit and celsius so when I read recipes in different units I don't need to convert.\n ", "\n  Easy to use and gets the job done! I made brownies, toast, heat up pizza, etc.\n \n  I like that the size of the inside of the oven is just about the size of the entire oven, keeping it small, but maximizing space for cooking. I like the three separate disks for time, temperature, and functions. It\u2019s nice that you can select toaster, baking, or broil. Oven is labeled clearly. Easy to read and understand.\n \n  Heats real well.  Hard to judge temperature without a magnifying glass.  Numbers on dials are really small.  Other than that it's ok\n \n  The setup was easy, very simple to use and the best part is quick cleaning.\n \n  Sleek design .  Ez to operate .  Roasts nicely and overall a nice countertop  oven .\n \n  I like how this toaster oven does not emit a burning smell. It cooks food evenly and quick.I haven\u2019t cooked a large piece of meat in it.  I bought to toast waffles and heat up frozen chicken tenders/pizzas\n \n  First of all, I love it because it's much more powerful than the oven I had before. Stainless Steel looks very good in my kitchen, and it's very easy to clean it. Very easy to use all functions, which wasn't cased with my previous toaster oven. It's very easy to make a toast which  also wasn't case with my previous oven. Well designed timer.  I simply love it.\n \n  This is what I use in the mornings to get my breakfast started smoothly. I just plop the bacon onto the tray which I cover with aluminum, because they're going to eventually stain if I don't, and set the timer and get on with the rest of the preparations. They also toast bread really well but I just enjoy the sound of toast popping out in the mornings\n \n  This is a great toaster oven. Its easy to use and it bakes, broils, and toasts beautifully & evenly plus Its not bulky.\n \n  This toaster oven works so well for my kitchen. My biggest thing for my kitchen is that it looks beautiful and doesn't have any bulky, ugly appliances and this toaster oven makes my kitchen look complete and sleek. It goes perfectly in my kitchen and the best part is that it works amazingly!! My food always comes out tasting great and evenly heated.\n ", "\n  I had an issue with this toaster oven cooking evenly. The seller held true to the 2 yr warranty, offering a replacement and/or refund right away at no charge. Wonderful service!! Thank You!\n \n  So far the product has lived up to my expectations. Can\u2019t wait to get years of service from it!\n \n  The oven is very convenient to use, the removable crumble tray is very convenient to clean the inside and temperature control seems pretty accurate. Would definitely recommend this model.\n \n  I love this toaster oven, great deal at a great price.  Its compact so it doesn't waste alot of space, but plenty of room to cook what we want.  Heats up very fast and easy to use.\n \n  We just received our toaster oven and im so glad we picked this one. It looks great, i love the recipe book it came with and its very intuitive to use. So far so good! Ill update this post after i spend a good month using it! Ill post pics of the recipes i make from the book as well\n \n  Heating elements do not turn off.  Thermostat is poor.  I returned it.\n \n  It is the perfect size for my kitchen, works great, and the price was great.....very pleased.\n \n  Of course it makes great toast, but after baking eggs, cooking pizza, and making quesadillas, I\u2019m excited to have this toaster oven. Easy to clean, light weight, and compact great addition to the kitchen.\n \n  A little small but good. I think I could have gotten a larger oven for less\n \n  I bought this for my daughter who lives in VA and she's very pleased with the way it works.  I have no first-hand knowledge.\n ", "\n  The oven rack is too small and falls out of the track when good is on it\n \n  I love the quality and design. Heats up fast and pretty accurate settings. I hope it lasts a long time.\n \n  A great toaster oven at an attractive price. Well made and compact. Easy to use.\n \n  ......but hard to read numbers on dials.....otherwise, good product\n \n  This toaster oven far exceeded our expectations!  Don't hesitate if you are looking for one like this.\n \n  This is such an awesome upgrade from our old toaster oven. The temperature controls are very accurate, and the different zone settings make it easy to cook a variety of different foods. As with an toaster oven, there are parts that are hard to clean, but that is to be expected. Overall this was a worthwhile purchase that I would recommended highly to anyone.\n \n  Great toaster oven.  Heats items well and very easy to use.  My son uses it to both cook and heat his food.  Size is great and fits on a small table.  Definitely would buy it again.\n \n  This is a bit smaller item than we were expecting in terms of how it compared with our last one.  Because it's small we are having trouble keeping things from burning on the bottom......could be operator error but we are following it's instructions.  This one will find it's way to a thrift shop shortly.\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing! Super sleek and beautiful design and the controls are fool proof! Easy to understand the settings and heats and cleans up quickly! I highly recommend this toaster oven!\n \n  When I use the timer function, the toaster shuts off without dinging before it reaches the \u201cOff\u201d tick. This is extremely disappointing as I was attracted to the product design and I like how it looks on my counter, but it just doesn\u2019t function as it should and is so frustrating to use. I would like to know how I can get a replacement that works correctly.\n ", "\n  I bought this to use for my smaller cakes I cook for my coworkers and family members and it's worked great so far. I actually use it for more than just my cakes now, which is something I wasn't expecting and is super convenient. I can cook food for myself very easily and not have to use the kitchen oven.  I just wish it had a longer timer than 30 minutes.\n \n  I was skeptical when I opened this and saw how small it is. But then I plugged it in and gave it a shot... Talk about pleasantly surprised! Not only is this nice and compact on your counter, it does a fantastic job making anything you can fit into it. I've done pizzas, casadilla's, roasted peppers, grilled cheese, chicken... All came out great!\n \n  I am glad I purchased this it works great and does a great job.\n \n  This was a gift from my kids.  Out old toaster oven had been needing replacement for a while.  This was a great surprise.  The oven is the perfect size... not too small but not taking all the counter space.  Appears to work well on all the settings.  Have to remember to set the temperature on the toast setting to get the best results.  All-in-all a great toaster oven.\n \n  I needed a new counter top toaster oven to replace my old one that died a few months ago. I\u2019ve looked at probably every one they make online and settled on this one because it doesn\u2019t take up much space in my kitchen and it\u2019s good quality for the price. I tested it right out of the box and it cooked my pizza slices like a pro, way better than my old one.\n \n  Love this little machine!  Small in size but it does exactly what you need it to.  Priced right and looks sleek.  Love it!\n \n  Just got it and used for the first time. The size is perfect, not taking up much counter space. Controls are easy to read and use. Made perfect toast on the first try.\n \n  Works as  advertised... \n  I like that it's stainless steel and the select knob has an off position.

It is super lightweight and small enough where it does not take up a lot of counter space. I have had this for about a week and have cooked several dinners in it, heats up fast and cooks great. No more having turn to turn on my oven to cook meals\n \n  It arrived  early Sunday afternoon. I read through the leaflet, set up was easy and made a grilled cheese sandwich. I don't have a toaster so this comes in very handy. Happy with my purchase.\n \n  We also have an air fryer so this thing isn't getting as much use as it should, but it's perfect for warming up a couple pieces of pizza or whatever we need. I haven't had a problem with it yet.\n \n  Perfect size for our countertop, I like the way it heats and toasts,  I highly recommend!\n \n  Very badly designed. There is one precarious hinge, and when it comes loose, as happened after two uses, there is no way to reattach it. I would return to Amazon but it isn't worth the trouble.

Our whole family loves it, we don\u2019t even put it away because it\u2019s always in use! Great buy!!\n \n  Perfect size and easy to use \n  I like that it has knobs and is not digital. It's very easy to use.\n \n  I ALREADY HAD YOUR I-POD COFFEE MAKER AND LOVE THAT SO MOVING TO THE TOASTER OVEN WAS A NATURAL. \n  Perfect for small width counter top space, but has large interior space.  Two racks are nice and useful feature and this is what I was looking for.  The exterior finish is compatible with any kitchen d\u00e9cor.  Controls are easy to read and uncomplicated.\n \n  I had to send this product back. It didn't work at all.\n \n  Like the look and not to big.  I use it to bake a piece of fish or chicken.  Makes a quick meal for myself. Not sure I've used my oven since recieving.\n \n  Love the compact size and how well made it is.  Used it for toast and found that no matter what was done, one side did not toast as well, however, it cooks everything else well!\n \n  Great compact toaster oven. Has all the functionality needed for this busy single mom.  Especially the broiler. Very easy to use for my teenager.  Fits perfectly next to my coffee maker. I have limited space on my countertop. Good price too!\n \n  Perfect starter toaster oven for me and my boyfriend. We recently moved in together and a toaster oven was at the top of our kitchen appliances list.\n ", "\n  This appears to be a nicely finished well built product\n \n  Its ok, will not recommend for elderly people to used.\n \n  This oven is perfect. It is not bulky, fits easily on the kitchen top, and is easy to use. It heats up quickly and does most of the job conveniently. Easy to clean as well with the removable bottom tray. It is a fine looking 5 stars oven! Loving it!\n \n  after 15 minutes of making toast I had warm bread.  took 22 minutes to make 2 light brown pcs.  NOT REAL HAPPY, I'm sending it back and will stick to a brand name I know!!!\n \n  I liked my Mueller toaster oven because I can toast bread in a jiffy, bake my personal sized pizzas and heat up my lasagana in a snap. I really like the easy to read knobs as well. My homemade cookies cooked faster than normal. This little oven packs a big punch.\n \n  Kids begged me to get a toaster oven .  they wanted to have 4 slices so they can have at the same time.

Even bought my friend one for Xmas.\n ", "\n  It works great and is a nice addition to the kitchen and works great.\n \n  This toaster is smaller than anticipated but works well. It is nice for an office for one person occasional use, but probably not the best option for a family. The only thing to watch is if you set the timer for too long, you can\u2019t adjust it or turn it off early.\n \n  My toaster dies, thought why not combine an appliance... Works well for small jobs to avoid heating the house from the oven. Food with a specific time and temperature works quite well. But I have yet to figure out the settings for normal toast - pale and dry to burnt beyond.\n \n  Could not use it. Turned it on several times for hours and it kept smoking and had a burnt smell. Cleaned inside and kept trying with same problem. Had to return it.\n \n  I finally have a toaster of my own! I love the three functions instead of having one function such as toasting. It looks well made with good quality materials. Its decent size so not too big for my counter but not to small that it can't fit the food I want to prepare in it.\n \n  Great multifunction toaster oven.  I was surprised at all the features.  Family loves it and it doesn't take up much space!\n \n  I just received it but my first impression is good, it seems to be made quite well and I am excited to try the many uses\ud83e\udd17\n \n  The best toaster oven I have ever used and it has so many great features, all for a very reasonable price!\n \n  the trays keep falling off the sides. can't read the controls. Disappointed. They contacted me and said would refund me and not send it back - have not heard anymore from them and no refund.\n \n  This is a lovely, basic toaster oven. So far, I used it in oven mode (highest temperature) to bake frozen rolls, and in toast mode for bread (highest temperature, dark timer setting). I like the understandable control knobs, and also it takes up less counter space than some other models.\n ", "\n  Love this toaster oven! The design is very elegant and easy to use, and the size of the toaster oven is not overwhelming even though it can accommodate a lot of items. And the addition of a recipe book is a really nice touch! Highly recommend!\n \n  Toaster oven\u2019s are toaster ovens.  None of them are that great . they are what they are.\n \n  Came on time.

It distributes the heat very well and is very convenient.\n \n  I no longer have to use our main oven for heating g small snacks. I see a significant savings in electricity for that reason.\n \n  Heats up my food great! I thought it was going to be smaller, but it\u2019s a perfect size! Can easily hear 4 bread pieces at the same time! I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.\n \n  Stainless steel front and inside.  Sides black.

Would definitely recommend this product.\n \n  I replaced exact same toaster after 10 years, but manufacturer decided to increase the decibel level of beeper that beeps when toast is done. That\u2019s my only complaint.\n \n  Great toaster oven , works as described. It\u2019s compact for smaller kitchen . Space saver . Powerful and helpful in making meals. Really easy to use .\n \n  This is a great unit. The crumb tray is very awkward. It is difficult to use.

Still getting it broken in so perhaps I'm not doing something I should be.  Also it's more complicated than I wanted...doesn't anyone make a simple toaster oven?  I don't like that the crumb tray is not removable.\n \n  Works well. Had a problem with door staying open but customer service was fantastic, took care of it with no questions asked!\n \n  This product is a great appliance that I use often! It is very lightweight and not bulky, unlike other products I've looked at. It heats up very easily and requires a lot less energy than a traditional oven. Additionally, It takes up the very little space on my countertop. I'm very satisfied with this product.\n \n  Compact and stylish. Big enough for what I need to toast or reheat\n \n  Worked literally right out of the box. After the recommended 15 min \"oil burnoff\", heated quickly to 400F, and cooked a delicious Costco chicken Alfredo for the specified 55 minutes.\n \n  Easy to use and looks nice.

Nice compact size with easy to use controls!\n \n  Love the temperature control for the toaster setting, which helps make it less likely to burn toast. It takes some adjusting, but I appreciate that feature now. The smaller size and cute design makes the counter look better and less crowded. Seems like a well made product. So far so good!\n ", "\n  Having it for a week only. It looks well built, simple commands, enough power (1.1 KW).\n \n  I purchased this item for a Graduation gift for one of my coworkers!

Works well and cooks evenly.  Just for toast so far, but does well.\n \n  I have not used it, as it is a birthday present for my daughter,  but it is very nice & delivered on time.\n \n  This is just a fancier toaster!, not much fits.  The heat distribution is off as well, not happy.  Too expensive for the quality you get.\n \n  This is a great oven that's not made in China , I love this thing and just started using it. But so far so good. Thanks\n ", "\n  I like, unlike my last toaster oven, you can select \"on\" instead of using the timer.  It fits 4 bagels perfectly.

Great but\n \n  Good size for small kitchen\n \n  Great product, great price.\n \n  I\u2019ve had it for a couple of months and recently I noticed that the timer doesn\u2019t work properly.

I love the ease of use and the functionality. I appreciate being able to cook/reheat my food without having to turn on my gas oven.\n \n  This toaster oven started smoking the second time we used it. It was smoking out the side and it smelled like plastic. I thought that maybe we left some of the packing material inside or on the outside of the toaster but there was nothing.  The product was defective and a potential fire hazard.\n \n  This is much more complicated to use than mister toaster ovens. ", "\n  Nothing works correctly. Timer doesn't shut it off, temperature is all over the place. It's clunky and impossible to clean. Buy anything else.\n \n  This  is the third toaster oven I purchase and so far the best. I\u2019m really enjoying all the heat functions. I\u2019ve cooked several different meals from fish, baked brownies and reheating pizza and frozen meals.

I returned the item\n \n  It cooks so nice\n \n  Used for first time since buying- as expected for price range. Great counter appeal based appearance, love the easy to understand knobs for those of us who don't routinely venture into the kitchen. Added bonus is the sturdy + longevity vibe of the knobs/door. Would absolutely buy again!\n \n  This oven is very well built. It toast, bakes well. Easy to clean.\n \n  This product was cheaply made. Barely fits 4 of anything. To small to put a plate in.

It\u2019s lightweight and doesn\u2019t heat up the whole house whenever I need quick meal. I use it three times a day maybe more depending on how hungry I am.\n \n  This is my first toaster oven and it's awesome.  I've been using it twice a day.  I've used it on bake and on toast.

I\u2019d give it 5/5 stars. It also unlike a microwave doesn\u2019t ruin your food when it\u2019s reheated.\n \n  Bought this oven for my husband since he is a truck driver and travels for work constantly. He has been complaining how he doesn\u2019t like how microwave food taste so I decided to get him this over. He loves it, always talks about how good the food tastes now and how much he loves it .\n \n  Too new to comment - has different procedures\n ", "\n  I finally have a toaster oven.  This is so convenient and my kids love it.  We can toast waffles, bread, bagels quickly and with ease.  We love it so far!!!

German engineering\n \n  I love! Perfect for a quick warm up.\n \n  Love the toaster oven, we even made cookies, baked potatoes and spaghetti squash in it! That was especially helpful since the weather has been so hot. Looks great in the counter also. Had a small issue that was quickly fixed by the seller! Amazing customer service!\n \n  I so far have only used this for toasting bread and making grilled cheese sandwiches and it does those perfectly. The oven did come with a recipe book however and some of those meals look awesome so I'm definitely gonna try a few of them eventually.\n ", "\n  This is a great product. It is the perfect size to fit on my kitchen counter but still is spacious inside for all my toasting, broiling, baking, or re-heating needs.

This oven is easy to operate and is a perfect addition to my kitchen.\n \n  As expected great\n \n  Well I threw it out after a few months ,  didn\u2019t work for toast very uneven  .  Could not read the directions on the dials .  You get what you pay for , on this one\n \n  With my last toaster oven I never baked in it, I only used it for like toast and bagels, but with this one, I decided to give it a try and I am really impressed. I've baked cookies, brownies, casserole and so much more in this toaster oven. Very yummy every time.\n \n  The three modes are something new that I didn't see before. Would love to try it.\n \n  I really love this toaster oven however, the one caveat is that the ticking timer can become extremely annoying. I'm not sure if that is normal with toaster ovens in general because this is the first one I've owned. Other than that it works great!\n \n  Only made toast, but it came out perfectly. The oven doesn\u2019t take up much counter space. Good design.\n \n  This is great toaster oven. Very simple controls that do exactly what they are supposed to do.

A+++\n \n  Unit works well\n \n  This is a great size toaster oven with all the features I was looking for. We use ours for reheating leftovers, cooking for one or two and toasted bread. It takes a little practice to know how long to set the timer to get desired results with toasting. Overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.\n \n  Great oven. The size is perfect!\n \n  It works no better than my old, cheaper toaster oven. The write-up said it would hold 4 slices of bread - wrong!! The numbers on the dials are so small and dim that you have to tip the unit up to see.\n \n  I love this product! Great toaster oven and perfect size not to big!\n \n  At first I really liked this toaster, until the door handle broke. Making so the latch was not holding the door shut while cooking. I ended up returning to Amazon and bought a new different brand toaster at costco\n \n  Bought this to replace my old Black & Decker. Price was good. Fits perfectly under my counter. Not a combo air fryer which leaves your food Frozen in the middle. Timer button is a little hard to turn, but considering it's brand new I'm sure it will loosen up.\n \n  JUNK.  I was excited to purchase this to replace a $10 toaster that lasted 15 years.  It lasted less than 2 weeks - probably 6 uses - before the spring attached to the the glass door failed and then detached enirely. It is now useless and I am about to contact amazon to arrange a return.  I am so disappointed.\n ", "\n  nice size not too big\n \n  Great\n \n  As long as it works well I'm willing to give this 4/3.5 stars but cleaning it can be a pain (see headline). On the first use the tray showed burn outlines even though I've cleaned it several times.\n \n  Great small toaster oven from Mueller--heats fast and evenly, controls easy to use, plenty of room inside for meals for 1-2, sleek design is attractive. Glad I bought it, excellent value for money.\n \n  The quality is good, heats up good, but if you want toast, put the bread in when you enter the kitchen, by the time you have made your breakfast your toast might be done,,takes twice as long as a normal toaster.\n \n  I like the quality of this--BUT it's really small to be used for anything but the basics\n \n  Does just what is described.  Nice construction.  Bakes & Toasts very well\n \n  It is the perfect size, it's compact without taking away from the oven size. It works perfectly and all my food is delicious\n \n  Toasts nixel6\n \n  Great gift\n ", "\n  I bought this to replace our Cuisenart that made an ear splitting noise when toasting was complete. The Mueller is compact, looks nice and most importantly, has a nice comforting ding at the end of toasting. Not inaudible and not ear splitting, just right!\n \n  This is our second olster oven. My wife loves it\n \n  The oven arrived when promised, food heats quickly & evenly. Great temp control\n \n  Just got the toaster oven today - it fits perfectly in our kitchen. Can\u2019t wait to fire it up. Will update soon!\n \n  Perfect size and great function for small, fast meals. A little slow to heat up but no problems. Walls and top do not get too hot. Makes good toast. Love not turning on the stove for small items.\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing. It actually toasts bagels and bread. I use this daily and I'm very happy.\n \n  I like the simplicity of the toaster oven and the additional features. Also, the footprint is not too big as it is being used in an apartment.  I also like the large viewing window.\n \n  Love this toaster oven.  Size is perfect in my small kitchen. The directions for each setting are clear and easy to follow.

It\u2019s been great for quick meals for our busy schedules.\n \n  Can cook a lot of things,better half loves it\n \n  It works well for grilling meat and  I just made a berry cobbler using it. The toaster works great but all three controls on the oven must be used. We like using it in place of our large oven as we live in a hot climate.\n \n  Great little toaster oven so far. Love the temp features and the ability to bake/roast in the summer time without having to heat up my oven.\n \n  The oven is smaller than I anticipated...I don\u2019t think I could get a small casserole inside...and the heat for baking does not create even heat throughout the oven.\n ", "\n  I bought it for the office break room.\n \n  Toast well but other features non existent love \u2764\ufe0f\n \n  Worked fine but door is broken after 5 months. \n  This toaster was not a convection oven.

The temperature isn\u2019t true, it ALWAYS burns the bottom of the food & the timer is off. Too much trouble to box up and ship back so it just sits\n \n  Great toaster oven for the price.\n \n  Size was important since counter space is at a premium. Plus I now have a way to toast delicate breads that are gluten free and no more fishing in toaster slots!\n \n  Bought this for my mom. She says it\u2019s a great size and fits perfectly on the counter. It toasts for breakfast pastries, cooks for great lunch frozen pizzas and bakes chicken perfectly.

It fits nicely in my kitchen\n \n  The product looks pretty nice, just like how it described online and easy to use.\n \n  I wanted to find a toaster oven that wasn\u2019t cheaply made and could last time a long time. This product is sturdy and well-made and I trust this brand to deliver a quality product. It does the job and at a great price. Thank you!\n \n  Worked well, like options to control temperature, allow bake toast or broil, and timer. Dislike that when flat tray pulls out, the grid also comes out. Wish tray would come out easier. We\u2019ll see how long it lasts.\n \n  It has decent capacity and doesn\u2019t take up too much room. I prefer not using a microwave, so this is a great alternative to heating food without heating the whole house in the middle of a heat wave.\n \n  I bought this toaster oven because of all the great reviews I read.

My daughter made some small pastries in it and they came out all evenly cooked and , also the toaster oven is very easy to clean ! I would 100% recommend anyone to buy this product!\n \n  Everything great, with the exception of having to flip it to open a latch in order to remove the pan after it cools down to clean it.  Also have to be careful when you pull out tray so that you don\u2019t damage wire.  Everything else is great.\n \n  christmas gift for nyc dweller\n \n  Did not have the tray or rack. Nice quality control job.\n \n  Bought this for my daughter who is on grad school. Visited her recently and learn that the wire shelf inside constantly falls down because it\u2019s too short to fit properly.  This whatever she\u2019s cooking falls, too.\n \n  Not exactly what I expected.  No way to easily turn off the toaster function if toast is getting too dark.  Instructions aren't terribly clear.  However, I am adjusting.\n \n  It heats food thoroughly and quickly.  The cleaning part is never fun, but I really enjoy the toaster oven.\n \n  Overall this is a good toaster over. Heats leftovers well. But the toast control is hard to use, you think that you've put it on medium, but it only toasts for about 15 seconds. The settings are just very small to read.\n \n  Heats very unevenly, temp dial very difficult to set accurately, and the door broke on mine after less than a year of use. Don't be fooled by European make!\n \n  If you need a toaster oven this one is a great item to add to your home. It works great Anna cleans up easily.\n ", "\n  I've been wanting a toaster oven for a while now and this one is great! Affordable and easy to use/clean.\n \n  Perfect size for a small kitchen.

Excellent quality, sharp looking, compact toaster with a wide range of user friendly settings.\n \n  The heating coils are intermittent and the toaster function is not working at all. I expected much better quality from a Mueller, especially for the cost.\n \n  I love how quiet the oven is when cooking.  I have had many that are very noisy.  This one heats up very quickly, which is a plus!\n ", "\n  Smaller item perfect to save counter space, heats quickly and evenly, and like all the heating options. \n  Wonderful product.  Just the right size for me.  Toasts bread perfectly.\n \n  We are very pleased with our new Mueller toaster oven. It is very high quality and seems very durable. The knob controls work very well and seem sturdy. The toaster is lightweight and sleek. It heats evenly. Very well made.\n \n  I love this toaster.  It looks great on my counter!  Toast perfectly bread, bagels and garlic bread. I have used it to cook hash browns and French fries and did it in less time then in my oven, without all the heat.  It does everything I wanted it to do.\n \n  I'm not new at cooking and baking in a toaster oven but I have not been able to regulate it so that it doesn't burn on the bottom of anything I have baked or toasted.\n \n  I would not recommend this to anyone.. Letting on the dials. To small and dim to read, not good at all for making toast. Very cheaply made. Just very dissatisfied with it.\n \n  Unfortunately it was smaller then I thought and the bottom of what I put in there gets cooked fast then the top \"/ my pizza comes out burnt on the bottom and the cheese isn't even melted on top\n \n  Smaller than expected.\n \n  one issue is the toasting option....a little more involved than previous toaster ovens i have had.  The temperature knob has to be turned to a temp in order to toast\n \n  Gets way hotter than it's supposed to and cooks very unevenly. Basically half of whatever I put in is burned while the other half is undercooked. It even melted my oven mitt when I tried to take the pan out\n ", "\n  Excellent Value\n \n  Perfect little toaster oven! Looks nice, works good, perfect size for those small package meals!\n \n  The toaster oven door hinge broke about 32 days.  I have experiencing difficulty getting a replacement .\n \n  It is great for chicken wings reheating things to stay crisp. Extremely easy to clean timer is very accurate for the price this is a wonderful product.\n \n  This is a great toaster, especially for this price point. It looks sleek and has very easy to use knobs. I also really like the fact that you can move the toasting grate to different levels.\n \n  The toaster function doesn\u2019t appear to work. There is a dial to set for darkness and it doesn\u2019t heat up when the dial is on that setting. Unhappy with product and would return it if I could.\n \n  Bought this toaster less than a year ago. Worked ok until last week when the door broke. The door is on the crappiest hinge I could imagine and there's only one hinge. So now it's useless unless I want to stand there holding the door closed. While it was functioning it was only ok. Now I've learned you get what you pay for\n \n  While its called a toaster oven, it has bake and broil features. I subscribe to online meal delivery kits and most of their recipes require an oven. This proved to be a good replacement for an oven for a short term stay in another city.\n \n  Delivered with broken handle!\n \n  There is no convection feature to this and it is half the size advertised. This is my first deception sild on amazon. Do not buy it!\n ", "\n  This was a gift. Recipient was highly satisfied.\n \n  The toaster handle gets so hot it will burn you.

It does get Very hot if at the highest temp for a while, but not a big surprise, just beware.\n \n  The timer is a little noisy with the beeping and the sound of time up is very loud.\n \n  This toaster oven cooks really well, wether just toasting bread or cooking a small amount of meat or veggies for 2 people. I end up using the toaster oven more often than the main oven for small meals such as kabobs or 12oz of fish.\n \n  Do not buy this product.  Toaster oven doesn\u2019t have a pre-heat option so food burns.  I\u2019ve had it less than two months and the toaster control shuts off mid-cycle.  Too late by 4 days to return so I\u2019m stuck with an inferior product.\n \n  I\u2019ve used it a few times & enjoyed it.  I like the size.  I know you can\u2019t go wrong.\n \n  I am very unhappy with this purchase. The heat distribution is not even and because of where the rack can be placed, the food is either burnt on top and undercooked on the bottom or vice verse. I would not recommend.\n \n  I ordered this item for our office and it's a great little oven.  It has 4 features, bake, broil, toast and convection and the price is right.

So far everyone that has been over to my place has complimented on how awesome it looks. Then I cook them some bomb food and they love it. \n  This oven was delivered on June 26, 2018.  I\u2019ve used it 6 times.  Twice for pizza, once browning bread and three times for toast.  This morning I had baked waffles @400 - 5 min. Turned off oven.  A few min later, the glass door exploded.  Shattered glass everywhere.  What a mess.  No one was close to it thankfully.  A lot of money to only last 3 months.\n \n  I like that the preheat and temperature seem to be accurate, and it's quiet.  Dislike is: baking pan is not flat but uneven ripples, and that hairline gap between doors allows loss of valuable heat and adds to cooking time.  Was this not addressed by Q/A?  Because otherwise it's perfection.\n \n  I bought this for my mom's Tiny House in the mountains. She doesn't have room for a full size stove/oven, and really didn't need one. We wanted her to be able to make casseroles, bake a few cookies, or make things like cornbread etc. This oven is fantastic. \n  just an FYI, the doors swing way past the sides of the oven and they must be opened all the way if you want them to stay open and no slam shut..I did not take this into consideration when I measured the space for the oven, so just be aware!\n \n  This is a beautiful oven. It truly is spacious. It is relatively easy to set, but some things, like toast \"doneness\" have to be set by the temperature setting arrow, which is a little confusing until you know. I had to explain the feature to all my family. One nice feature is that when it is On, the oven light is on. This helps you remember to turn it off when you are finished using it. I didn't realize when I purchased it that it can also dehydrate, and I am excited about trying that feature. \n  I received this oven today I'm so glad we purchased one finally we live upstairs in our house the rest of my family is down stairs so we had to always share the oven downstairs I hated walking up and down to check food in the oven so having this will hopefully solve my problem of hiking up and down those stairs looks great nice size I hope to get a lot of uses out of it ...satisfied customer\n \n  When the doors are in the open position a slight bump caused them to spring closed rapidly, generally on your hand, and if you are holding a sheet pan or casserole, you will jerk your hands out reflexively and in addition to being burned, your food product will come flying out on your feet.  Terrible design in that respect.  The rest of the oven is pretty decent.\n \n  I love the look but.....the Stainless Steel marks up so easily and it's hard to remove any finger prints, water marks, etc... ", "None None None \n  \u00a0BUY THIS! Not a typical one start review thing to say but, hey, I say what I want.  The one start is for their totally fraudulent butthead liar move of claiming the sleek new look of black stainless.  Not in any shape, form or (more importantly!!) color.  The picture shows it next to a black stainless food processor base and stainless automatic salt & pepper mills for comparison.  This thing is LITERALLY classic stainless with out a hint of tint. (PERIOD).  I'm obviously super annoyed by it.  That being said, BUY THIS!  Its massive (that is an average sized frozen pizza). \n  After our Waring counter top convection oven died before Thanksgiving, I was disappointed to find that most counter top ovens were too small for my needs.  This Oster is perfect, if a pan will not fit side to side the oven is amazing deep, rotate 90 degrees and there we go.  Convection and baking works well -- the heat is remarkably even throughout the cooking space. \n  The Oster French Door Toaster Oven, Model TSSTTVFDDG was purchased less than a year ago through Amazon. It was seldom used, maybe a few dozen cookies, toast, bagels and maybe a few warm up items. As time went on it took longer and longer to even cook toast. Turned out the top heating element was not lighting (heating) which meant a piece of toast cooked in about 10 minutes and needed flipping. Contacted Sunbeam, which makes Oster. Took almost a half hour to get a real person. Was told the item had to be shipped back for examination to determine cause and if it would be repaired or replaced..... but they would pay to ship back the old one. Estimated time for repair or replace was about three weeks. Just wheat we needed with the holidays coming. When I complained about the time etc.. with holidays, I was told that was the way it was. \n  Great way to cook with out heating the whole kitchen and much faster than Conventional Oven . I cook 14\" frozen pizza in 12 minutes including pre-heat.  Bake squash or other things in minutes with the \"Turbo Convection \" .  Cooks much better than a toaster oven or Microwave than can make foods \" rubbery or chewy \" , like left overs. Big enough inside that , clean easily I slow cooked a 3.5 lb Roast in a covered Crock .  The Racks and drip pan  clean easily . We are completely satisfied....\n \n  This is proble the best purchase I\u2019ve ever made . We don\u2019t have a stove in our rental house , so this is really the next best thing . You can cook a whole pizza ! All you have to do is press the \u201cPizza\u201d button & walk away . Cooks it PERFECT everytime . We\u2019ve cooked a few meals in it , evenly cooks . Double doors that open together . Great purchase ! Took a risk spending that kind of money , but glad i did . Highly recommend this product .\n \n  Great oven! I\u2019m used to our loud toaster oven with the timer. This one is so quiet and works so well! I love the French doors. Makes things easier to get in and out.\n \n  Loved the size of the unit. But French doors were not made properly to allow for sealed closure. Upon closure doors do not touch each other. Too much space left between closed doors allowing heat, meant for cooking, to escape.\n \n  Danger! My wife got a pretty bad burn from the door closing on her wrist.\n \n  Bought for husbands birthday.  He wanted something to use to cook in the garage during the summer to keep the kitchen cool. \n  Bigger than any other toaster oven I could find. I've made whole chickens, baked bread and cookies, roasted vegetables, and made fish sticks and tater tots for the kids, all great. Some reviewers flagged the doors as an issue and I can see the potential for them to snap shut unexpectedly but I haven't had that problem yet. Max temp on this oven is 450, not bad and works great for bread. This unit is very light, I use it outside but store it in the house, very ease to carry in and out.\n ", "\n  I Just took my new unit out of the box.  I gave only one star because the cord It is only 24\" MAX  and it comes out of the bottom end under the unit so if your wall plug is on  the opposite end of this unit where you need to set this unit you can not plug it in without a extension cord. It should either be a much longer cord or it should have come out of the outer center at the bottom of the unit.\n \n  As a constant buyer of products Amazon sells for the actual manufacturers, I concluded that the actual manufacturers products they sell through Amazon have some kind of defects. Most consumers that purchase larger items, such as electric heaters, microwave ovens, and such, don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of returns. The manufacturers of those items know that. So these manufacturers count on only a 50% - of actual returns. \n  I am so pleased with this toaster oven.  We use ours in place of our regular oven.  So far it has performed as well as our regular oven.  The only thing i have not tried to bake yet is cookies, i am confident that it will be another success.  The oven light makes it a lot easlier to bake with.  The convection feature work perfectly.  Everything that i have baked has browned evenly.  Love this oven!\n \n  This is a great toaster oven as far as performance and size are concerned.  It is slow but it cooks thoroughly and completely.  The shelves are study enough to hold our cast iron cookware.  The only thing that is not so great is that while the doors do open together which makes it convenient, they do not stay open on their own and will slam at inconvenient times.  However, over all a great product.  We have had for some month now and only problem is the doors.\n \n  I'm disappointed in this oven... I bought it for the extra large size, which is really nice size. \n  DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER OVEN. First, the toaster oven got lost in the mail, so I had to order another. Upon my first time using this toaster oven, I preheated it to 375 on turbo convection and right after it beeped to alert me of it being preheated, it exploded and shattered glass flew at me. Luckily I wasn\u2019t directly in front of it. And luckily I hadn\u2019t yet put the food in it.\n \n  I've received two ovens now because the first one came damaged. Now the second one they sent is damaged even worse then the replacement. I don't know if this is Oster or Amazon's fault. The first one the doors were off balanced and wouldn't shut properly, plus the sides were bent in. The second oven the back was completely bent on and the ventilator knob (I think that's what it was) was broke off. Very disappointed.\n \n  Perfect 2nd oven in my kitchen! Wish the top rack could go up an inch or so, so the bottom rack could handle a baking dish of more than 1/2\" tall.  Some design change like that would make it more versatile. Doors must swing pretty wide on either side to stay open, so allow an extra 3\" or so if positioning next to a wall or cabinet. Easy to use, interior lighted when in use - I like that. Would buy again.\n \n  I have had a Hamilton beach convection oven for 10 years and it still worked great but the numbers had wore off and I could only fit a small, square casserole dish in it. I got this one because it\u2019s huge and I could actually fit large casserole dishes inside.  While it\u2019s beautiful and I love the design there are a few negatives I\u2019ve noticed so far. Firstly, it has a ton of space and two racks but you can really only use the top rack because the bottom rack space is so narrow and there are only two slots to put the racks in, one for the top and one for the bottom rack so they\u2019re not really adjustable and it would be nice to adjust them to fit maybe two casserole dishes inside. The next thing I noticed is the buttons are not easy to push, we had to push them several times to manage the settings, I actually wish I had just gotten the one with knobs. The last thing I noticed was the French doors can get easily nudged and when they do they come slamming closed and if you have your arms in the way with a dish you will get burned. I\u2019ve noticed all of this from just one use. 3 family members got burned in the process. I know it just takes some getting use to with the doors but I am disappointed in the racks and buttons. \n  Cooks like a full sized oven! Our oven broke and we can\u2019t afford a full sized oven so we got a cheap one from Walmart but it just didn\u2019t cook right. This is proper baking. The convection is so perfect I don\u2019t see myself using anything else. It\u2019s not without its flaws though, for one the timer you set before preheating counts towards the preheat time and the bake time. So if you set 10 minutes and it takes 4 minutes to preheat, you\u2019ll be baking for 6 minutes. Also there is no pause between preheating and baking, as soon as it\u2019s done preheating it beeps and keeps ticking the timer. I usually combat this by adding 5 minutes to the bake time and adjusting the timer after preheat to make sure it\u2019s exact. With convection, you don\u2019t need to add any time to frozen dinners with oven times, the toaster oven can do it in the same amount of time.\n ", "\n  This convection oven is such a great assist in the kitchen for small quick cooking. I am a bit disappointed in the temperature control. I tried dropping the temperature down about 25 degrees when baking but I still don\u2019t have it correct. The back of the oven get hotter than the front si I must rotate all my baking. It is a very handy appliance.\n \n  Bought it to use daily in my rv .  Very disappointed with it.  Convection does not work well.  Heats up to much and toes not cook evenly.  The back of the pan cooks to fast, have to rotate my pan around.  Send the first one back for a replacement and still the same.  Not sure what I will do at this point.\n \n  So far this has been a great product, really love not having to heat up the entire traditional oven when I want to make some sweet potato fries. The only issue I have is that the unit shuts off when the timer goes off. Sometimes I need to flip food after 10 minutes but the entire unit shuts off and I have to restart it. Just a suggestion but they should really change that feature.\n \n  I have been using this for a while now, I do not know what happened to the broiler coil on top but now it is not working proper.  If anyone has a suggestion of what I might need to do please post.  Thanks.  Other than that it has been working fine.\n \n  The french doors take some getting used to.  I  managed to burn both my arms before I got the hang of it.  The outside of the unit as well as the doors get VERY HOT.  I think they could have designed it so there was better insulation.  The metal seems very thin.  That said, it does a lot, and works as advertised.\n \n  Love this oven. This is my second. I use it every day. Highly recommend it. I don\u2019t have to use my big oven. This is big enough for almost everything.\n \n  I have used this convection oven a couple of times and every time it does not cook in the appropriate time.  If the cooking instructions are 350 degrees for 30 minutes it takes about 90 minutes to heat.  Does not matter if done on Bake or Convection Bake still does not heat properly.  It could be because the doors do not touch in the middle and all the heat escapes instead of cooking the food.  WORST PURCHASE I have ever made.  Total disappointment\n \n  I love this oven!  I've had several countertop oven over the years and this ranks at the top.  I have some mobility issues and using the regular stove oven is extremely difficult. \n  Actually a bit bigger than expected, but looks like it will work well. Little concerned about the low temp the first time we used it. I'll give an update after we've had it for a while. Want to see if the low temp was just user error or product error.\n \n  It cooks well enough and fits good sized pans on the top rack, but has some negative features as numbered below. I kept it but would not buy again and don't recommend it unless you can put up with its negative features. ", "\n  We received the oven in good time and  condition. Upon opening the carton and examining the oven we concluded that it was not up to our expectations regarding quality. It felt cheaply constructed and rough sounding when opening and closing the doors. Very light weight and the controls seemed awkward. We returned the oven due to these conclusions.\n \n  I used this at food shows, 2 times per year for 3 days each time.  I would use it for maybe 2 hours/day off and on during these times.  It was packed up and not used in between shows.  It worked great the first two times.  The third time, I plugged it in and the oven would not turn on.  (Power and connections were tested and all functioned.)  We had to scramble and buy new ovens at a local hardware store.  Really really disappointing given the price and great reviews on this item.  I definitely had higher expectations.\n \n  It looks great.  It fit in the spot available perfectly.  It does everything! Toast, broil, bake, convection ( great for re-heating and making frozen things crispy).  I got a set of cookware that is the perfect size for the oven!  I moved into a unit that has propane in it and I am a total wienie about open flames and won't use the oven or the burners, so this is perfect!!\n \n  This Oster French Door Oven is the greatest!!!  I love the size and the fact that the french doors open up so easy.  It cooks your food perfectly and is very easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product.  I would have given it 10 stars but they only have 5 stars to chose from.\n \n  Loved the look of this oven but sooooo disappointed in it. \n  This is a very nice oven,  Easy to use and cooks evenly.  The light inside is very bright and makes it easy to see inside. However, after purchasing this oven, we saw the same exact oven and model number at Costco in Harrisonburg Va for $139.99.  Quite a big difference from the $173.84 we paid it.  Would have paid to check around I guess.\n \n  I dislike this oven with a passion.  Had my husband not thrown away the box the day I got it I would have sent it back. I paid $200 for it and all it does is over cook the outside while the inside is not done.  I have tried turning the temp down by 25 degrees and it still burns stuff.  You can only adjust the temperature 25 degrees at a time while does not seem to equal out what you really need.  I loved the idea of the french doors but I have also burned my arm by not making sure they lock when you open it.  I am really sorry I bought it because now I am stuck with it.  The whole idea was to keep my kitchen cooler during our 100 degree days and this does not do it, the heat that radiates off of it is like having my stove on, not happy with it at all.\n \n  Very nice and spacious countertop oven. Works great for a single or a couple. My conventional oven's door fell off its hinges and I don't want to spend big bucks on a new electric range right now. This Oyster is perfect for me and my wife. The outside gets very hot of course but it works great. Very happy with the purchase.\n \n  We LOVE this! It\u2019s an amazing oven and looks great. We\u2019ve had it about a month and used it almost daily. I\u2019ve baked breads, cakes, chicken, meatballs, pizza, etc. The toast function is perfect as well - I was nervous I\u2019d have to buy a separate toasted but nope! I can\u2019t recommend this enough. I love showing it off to friends and family.\n \n  Bought this for my husband for our anniversary and we BOTH love it! Only thing it is missing, is air frying, but I'm sure the convection heat can do the job. I just have to give it a whirl! Also, you don't have to cook/bake/toast food as long as you would in a normal oven. It is also big enough to cook a whole meal for 4 and then some! It also has the capabilities to dehydrate and defrost, as well as many, many other options I have yet to discover! Highly recommend!\n ", "\n  I love this oven! The first one came broken (temp buttons) wouldn\u2019t work. So the whole system would come in. Requests a replacement, and they sent it out and UPS came and got the broken one. The new is perfect. The convention feature is amazing. You have to kinda figure out your temp and times for convection. (Go down, temp and time) I\u2019m going down 25-30 degrees and taking about 10 - 20 off depending on what I\u2019m cooking. Love how you can fit regular (small) pans and full size pizzas. We have a family of 6 and cane make enough for everyone\n \n  Because it came with pretty much worthless instructions and no detailed  cook book covering what tray location and pan type to use to  do a specific operation. I can down Oster's specific cookbook only if I'm willing to allow their cookies on my computer, which I'm not. Oh well, I can roam around YouTube and hope I can find out what I need for this particular unit. It's  a shame because I'm pretty sure it will do more than I will use, and do it well. Het, Oster marketing guys; I can understand why you would want your cookies on my computer but I'm a little unclear on why I'd want them. Well, except you are hold the instructions hostage for them. Bad Marketing, bad.\n \n  We really like the large interior and the French doors.  This unit cooks much more evenly than all of the other smaller ovens we\u2019ve owned.  The only complaint we have is that the control buttons are a bit hard to press.\n \n  We've had this toaster/Oven for a little over a month and we are very happy with it.  It's amazing.  We've made homemade pizza's that turned out perfect.  We roasted a medium size chicken.  Turned out perfect as well.  I make toast for myself every morning.  Again, perfect.  The one thing I would mention is that the unit gets very hot so you have to be careful not to get too close to it while it's cooking and use oven gloves when handling the doors.  Don't let small children use it without supervision.  All in all, we are very happy with this product.\n \n  Manual found .  I am beginning to truly enjoy my Oster convection toaster oven.  My pineapple cake was too brown because I needed to put items on the bottom rack, live and learn.  Still tasty. My Apple pie came out pretty good. I should have baked my bottom crust for 15 minutes. It still tasted delicious. My chicken pot pie was very good. All in all I am very happy with my counter top oven.\n \n  Was really pleased when this artived...was very surprised on how big it was...true to the advertising .  Dual doors work fantastic..just have to open all the way, then they stay open..use this now instead on my regular oven.  Very very pleased with this product.\n \n  need a backup oven or a second oven this is your item , it works great. it cleans up good  it's not your toaster oven. This will handle big jobs.\n \n  Takes way to long to heat up.  Takes up way to much counter space.  The toaster feature is a joke it takes forever to make your toast.  The accessories warp when put in but go back once they cool off.  I guess it serves a purpose if your having a party and need another oven but that doesn\u2019t happen all that much for me at least so this stays in the storage room until it\u2019s needed\n \n  Not happy at all. The gap between the doors does allow for a lost of heat loss. I have tried bread a few times and no matter where I place the racks the top burns, on both convection and normal bake. \n  To be honest I wasn\u2019t expecting this unit to be this useful.  It bakes well broils well. Has both conventional and convection settings. This has been used daily while I remodel my kitchen. Easy to clean, easy to use, uses far less heat than a traditional oven.  i have cooked everything from pizzas, to raw stuffed and breaded chicken breast and cooks it with no problems. Fantastic for truly  crispy potatoes with not fryer or air fryer.\n ", "\n  Good but with design flaws. \n  While I haven't yet tried every function, I have been very pleased by the way it functions so far. It is only about 2 inches wider than my previous countertop device, so it fits in the same space, yet I can easily fit pans that I couldn't use before, especially with the extra depth from the bumpout. I only wish it had at least one, possibly two, more positions available for the racks.\n \n  Extremely nice unit! Best looking toaster oven I\u2019ve ever seen, so it dresses the kitchen up nicely. And it works better then any I\u2019ve used in the past. Bought this one to replace an older one of similar size. This one works so much better. Toasts perfectly and quicker.\n \n  I like how it looks! I like how hot it gets -yet the doors don\u2019t come together so heat escapes -there\u2019s no reheat button so it has to preheat all the time! \n  It looks very nice, and cooks pizza, chicken nuggets, vegetables, and roast very well.  That being said I gave it only four stars, because when I took it out of the box it had a dent in the top near the front right.  It still works fine, however I did buy a warranty for it and had not yet received it yet!  So I kept it anyway!  I probably won't buy it again, if and when this fails, I don't want my new stuff with a dent in it!\n \n  So we got the oven, nice looking, double doors are cute, but easy to burn yourself if you are used to a single door.  Several factors to get used to.  Doors need to be opened all the way to eliminate slamming shut.  I would always double check that.  Got a nice burn on my belly from the pan because it closed and hit the pan.  Temp controls and all of the keypad should be easier to use, you have to push hard in a small area.  Overall the oven has many settings and appears to be pretty awesome.  As far as the double doors go just be careful until you are used to it.  Wouldn't recommend a youngster use it without some serious explaining.\n \n  I liked the French doors on this oven..we already had (still have) it's 'little' brother, a single door, swing/down type, that still works great, but doesn't have the extra goodies like the pre-heat feature & extra space this one has. We've used without any issues, for nearly a year. This is a great product, it also has just a little bit more inside space needed for extra-sized pans that the previous model lacked.\n \n  I bought this when my gas oven stopped working to let my wife cook while repairs were made. she came to love it so much she uses it more than the gas oven after it was repaired. Of course large meals like a turkey are still done in the gas oven but having the electric there for quick daily use is great. And she uses it for other cooking while the turkey is roasting in the gas oven. Our different meal parts are done more timely so we are not waiting dinner just for one to finish. It has been great for several months now.\n \n  I like baked potatoes.  I wanted to stop using the big oven for a couple baked potatoes but wanted flexibility to cook pizza and apple crisp in 8x8 pan. I've tried all of these, including french fries and chicken nuggets, chicken breast and country-style ribs.  This will save on energy costs!  Looks nice on counter.  I have not experienced the outside being overly hot but I make sure nothing that can melt is near it.\n \n  This is a very good investment!!! Do not use my 220 oven at all.  And it is a nice addition to my kitchen.\n ", "\n  Great product. I love the pre-programmed settings. I use this daily instead of my big gas oven.\n \n  This oven is outstanding. There are 2 of us at home, semi-retired, and the size is perfect. Two shelves allow an entree and roasted veggies (I like Brussel sprouts). It bakes biscuits perfectly, holds a 10\u201d cast iron skillet for pot pie, and heats as well or better than the gas oven I have. Id recommend this to anyone looking for a countertop addition to the kitchen.\n \n  Purchased this for past holidays to easy the tension about the double oven not having enough room. Actually used it to cook rolls and casseroles and they turned out great. Now it has been used from fish , pizza, cinnamon rolls everything comes out great. Have even put in separate thermometer to watch temperature and spot on. Is very spacious and works great.\n \n  I gave this oven 2 stars because I am tired of getting burned each time I use it.  Everything gets extremely hot even the doors.  I will not use it when my grandkids are around for fear that they burn themselves... if it weren\u2019t too late I would return it. I kept thinking that I would get use to it. I use potholders but if I have to reach in... boom I get burned.  Very disappointed\n \n  The best counter top over owned. Fits counter like a glove. It cooks food fast and leaves it just the way we like it. The door are great opening up just using one handle. Size hold a lot of food. Emmy\n \n  We bought this oven to cook some of the extra stuff for Thanksgiving dinner. To that end, it worked perfectly. Some of the dishes at my wife cooked in it turned out perfectly.\n \n  This is a great oven.  It meets all of my family's needs.  A huge step up from our previous oven.\n \n  Product works well. Very quiet. Must not have much insulation as the sides and top get too hot to put anything there. Temp/time on this model are push button and kind of tricky to use. Knobs would be easier. Double doors look nice and function well but open together so care must be used when hot. Lots of functions, accurate temps and cooking.\n \n  Yo compr\u00e9 un equipo de doble puerta y digital. Tienen que poner mejor atenci\u00f3n a lo que compramos, no a lo que tienen en stock. Decepci\u00f3n total. Quiero devolver.\n None \n  Just unboxed, and found out it will not except 16\u201d pizza as advertised. Disappointed a little because this is one reason why we purchased this model.\n ", "\n  Bought to toast and bake outside and not heat up tge kitchen \n  My regular oven died before Thanksgiving and needed something to serve until new one came in.  Between this and my toaster oven and stove all was well.  One caveat is to make sure you open the door all the way otherwise it will close and I got a bad knuckle burn because of this.  But doors stay open if you are careful to open all the way.\n \n  very fast does a pizza in like four minutes. it's a big size toaster over so think about your counter space, nice one hand operation spring loaded doors that snap open I love it\n \n  Everything I have cooked has come out better than the equivalent cusinart it replaced.\n \n  Works amazingly well.  Have cooked wings in it mostly, but also cooked chicken thighs once when on the road in our rv.  Nice oven.\n \n  I don\u2019t know how I lived without this oven before. What a wonderful oven it does everything. I love it!\n \n  I really like this little oven. Only down fall is the doors!  The doors are spring loaded and if it\u2019s not open all the way, they will close on you. I had to learn this the hard way and got burned by the doors. So from now on I always make sure the doors catch and stay open before I get anything out of there.\n \n  Not sure why there are any bad reviews! One person said his regular oven cooked faster, well mine doesn\u2019t. Love this little oven! Great for take and bake pizza and frozen entrees. \n  It get pretty hot on the outside but I love this. It replaces a microwave. Food cooks well and faster than a normal oven\n \n  Ive had this convection oven for over 6 months now, and I am happy to say it's been a fantastic tool and excellent replacement for a large conventional oven, and I still have no complaints. ", "\n  This thing is huge so make sure you have the counter top space for this. It looks great and functional. If you have no oven at all, this is a legit oven replacement.\n \n  Couldn't find a part for our commercial range. Had to cook holiday meals in this toaster oven and it did not disappoint. Pre heats, toasts perfectly. It almost appears its doing nothing at all until you view the results when the timer goes off.  MUST BE CAREFUL OF THE SPRING TENSION DOORS. YOU MUST OPEN ALL THE WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN HOT AS THE DOORS WILL QUICKLY SWING BACK TO THE CLOSED POSITION IF YOU DON'T.\n \n  Fabulous so far. Outside doesn\u2019t get too hot, Quality is apparent. Nice buttons and features and seems easy enough to clean.\n \n  This product works well.  I have not used it a whole lot but it has worked very well each time I use it.  I hope it is of good quality and lasts long.\n \n  I bought this as a gift so I get my information from a friend. My friend loves this oven. He uses this instead of his large oven and everything has come out just right.\n \n  I love to use this counter top versatile oven. A simple read of the instructions for use and your on your way to preparing everything efficiently. This oven is a joy to have and use many times Daily. ! ! ! \ud83d\ude0a only thing for me is working around quick doors with rather sharp edges... very minor behavior adaptation.\n \n  Excellent for the price as it cooks dishes so fine! You really can't go wrong here, also the french doors open perfectly!\n \n  I've used it twice and so far so good. It cooks great. It does take as long as my oven to preheat(about 10 minutes), but I'm sure it uses much less power to cook in it than the oven. It does cook toast quickly and it's very spacious.\n \n  Well worth the $$$. Love this oven. Use it every day for several months. SO MUCH nicer to use than the big oven. Bakes and Broils evenly. Easy to clean. There's been nothing I couldn't cook in this. AND it's beautiful!\n \n  Very convenient when I try to make a cake or a pizza without having to use my actual kitchen oven since it\u2019s used too much electricity. This used a lot less electricity. It\u2019s A little hard to clean around the edges but it works well.\n ", "\n  I wanted to love this oven, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t heat evenly, seems to take longer to cook foods, and anything on the bottoms rack doesn\u2019t cook very well at all. Once the item on the top rack is finished, I have to move the second item to the top so it can actually cook. I\u2019m still trying to figure out which is better/faster bake or convection. Convection is a little noisy due to the fan.\n \n  A lovely counter top show-off! This thing is good looking. And it works beautifully. I'm still adjusting to learn temperature settings and time but that will come. Seems this oven (which does not have a seal between the doors so it must be letting out heat) takes a little longer to bake whatever it is you're baking. But this is all I need in my fully functioning cabin kitchen. It can handle more than just my wishes, I can easily bake things for company size fun too. Ahhh, to be rid of that big oven -- what a pleasure.\n \n  We hardly every use our Kitchen oven we use this and it works fantastic. Works great for toasting, cooking, re-heating. It's easy to clean and good size too. It is simple to operate and we use it daily.\n \n  I LOVE  this counter top convection oven.  I use it several times a day.  I can bake, broil and warm up food without having to turn on my big oven.  Makes toast in a jiffy.  I highly recommend this product.\n \n  We have loved this addition to our kitchen! It preheats quickly and cooks evenly. Our 4 teenagers use the toast setting - making everyone\u2019s toaster strudel or bagel pizzas at once. The convection feature makes adding last minute dinner sides a breeze!\n \n  I bought this for my daughter as the one she had wasn\u2019t working too good , and that had been her second one  She loves this new Oster oven, it was more expensive than her previous two but she said it is well worth it, it\u2019s very easy to use and versatile .\n \n  Used in my \u201cMan Cave\u201d!  Pizza! Lasagna! TOAST! Cooks hot, 45-40 min can be reduced to 35 min! EXCELLENT product, PLEASED!\n \n  Easy to use/clean. Preheats relatively quickly. Love the convection setting.\n \n  It preheats much faster than my big oven and doesn't heat up the kitchen nearly as much. It's truly like having a second oven. I no longer have to wait for one thing to get done in the big oven, before starting another course, which bakes at a different temperature than the first one. With having this countertop oven now, I can complete the whole meal at once and serve it hot, instead of one dish getting cold, while waiting on a second dish to bake!\n \n  Extremely versatile because of its large size and double racks. I used it over the holidays and it was a life saver becoming in effect a much needed second oven.\n ", "\n  Keep in mind that is a French door the heat will scape a little bit from the door but still do it\u2019s job, the bottoms are deep and sometimes is hard to press\n \n  Worst toaster oven I\u2019ve ever had. Takes a long time to get to temperature. Broil function both top and bottom elements are on. If I need to brown the top of rolls have to put the broiler pan underneath the rolls. \n  So we baked a 15 lb turkey in this thing. It turned out perfect. It stayed juicy and browned beautifully. This is more than just a toaster oven, this is a mini oven. Toast comes out perfect, casseroles are beautiful. If you are making a bake from frozen item keep an eye on things. This little oven cooks things faster than your normal oven and tastes like it\u2019s cooked all day.\n \n  This unit is quite large and a bit pricey. It is worth ever penny. Sturdy and versatile toaster oven.  Haven't had a single issue with it. Highly recommend.\n \n  I love this oven. I use it all the time for everything. So much more efficient and even heating than my regular oven. It air fries great as well.\n \n  Everything works great except the \"toast\" part. It seems to take forever - the sausage & eggs are cooked and we're still waiting on the toast.\n \n  You do have to be careful that you fully open the doors other than that it is excellent so far, 1month in use everyday toast, nachos, and a spiral ham on Xmas eve\n \n  I left it plugged in all the time with no issues untill it stormed. The circuit fried and turned itself on and got extremely hot. Fire hazzard\n \n  Very nice piece of equipment. Looks great on the counter. Cooks evenly. Lots of room to cook whatever you want. The doors work great as well.\n \n  This is the perfect small oven for people who don't have or don't use their full oven. We love that the doors open to the side and stay open.\n ", "\n  I luv luv luv this toaster oven! The look w the French doors is adorable, it's huge. Came in very handy as an Xtra oven during the holidays\n \n  A great oven like the double doors and the size is nice so you can get more cooking done then using the stove oven  it\u2019s great because there\u2019s three of us so we cook in this more then the oven the only thing you need to be careful that you don\u2019t touch the doors when taking food in or out because the door will close with just a touch but other then that I\u2019m very happy with it\n \n  I have a very unusual kitchen space, and don\u2019t have the ability to have a true oven, we\u2019ve had toaster ovens in the past, but with prolonged use they\u2019ve all crapped out and it\u2019s been very difficult to regulate temperature.  This one is different!  Like other reviewers have stated you can actually bake in this! \n  I cooked in my oven tonight and realized the doors do not meet. I will get a thermometer and check temperature. I will have to call Amazon tomorrow. \n  Unit stopped working after five months of use.\n \n  No lo he usado a\u00fan porque es un regalo que le hago a mis hijos y lo env\u00edo a Guatemala\n None \n  We love this oven, we have a kitchen that doesn't have an oven and this is really the next best thing. \n  Loved the look. Dissatisfied with the doors not closing properly. Heats the kitchen up( reason I bought it to (avoid using my oven. My problem was I got rid of the box it came in ( no problems the first few times) now might not be able to return ?\n \n  it's huge.  it works.  it arrived.  it wasn't stolen.\n \n  Arrived on time,in good shape. Works great my wife has made cookies a meat loaf, and pie they all came out perfect.\n ", "\n  Excellent. On the larger size makes it very usable. It toasts, bakes, warms just like a big oven.\n \n  Hubby bought this for me for Christmas (it was on my list).  I really love it.  So easy to make meals without heating up the big ovens.\n \n  Perfect size, not too big not too small. Fits a lot of food.\n \n  I purchased one but I returned it the out exterior gets extremely hot\n \n  I thought the body would be black to match black appliances  Padi extra to have BLACK. Very disappoint in that.  It looks odd on the countertop where you see the gray side not black.\n \n  Love the oven. It heats up fast and has an indicator light to tell you when it reaches temperature.\n \n  Easy to use, double door allows for larger pans\n \n  This is a great oven, it does all types of cooking.  The functions are easy to figure out and the temperatures are close to a real wall mount oven.  If there was one complaint (and it's minor) it's that it takes a long time to warm to the correct temperature.  Other wise it is a great purchase and does all that it is called upon to do.. As a broiler it is great...\n \n  Works very well and better than my oven.Thanks !\n \n  Bought for a pizza party. Worked out great.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s big, it cooks great. The doors latch if you leave room for them to open all the way. There is a small gap where the doors meet that lets hot air out. My little kitchen gets hot because of it, but it\u2019s not unbearable.\n \n  Works great. Features very beneficial.\n \n  We love it.  Works great.\n \n  The brand is good. Haven't used it yet still in box\n \n  gave as a gift, person is very happy\n \n  This product takes toaster ovens a notch higher. Bigger pizzas, chickens, etc. Easy open doors. Complete control with digital readouts. Paul's Everyday Products proved an excellent vendor.\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing.\n \n  Just what the family wanted! Works great, and my youngest daughter does a lot of baking with this unit because it can hold more than our old one. \n  For a table top oven this really bakes rolls and I don,t  have to turn them, well worth the counter space it takes up.\n \n  I\u2019m using this instead of my microwave\n ", "\n  I love French doors and it has worked out well for me.  Sometimes I don't want to heat big oven for little stuff and this oven is perfect.  I haven't tried every feature, cause I'm still playing around with it.  I love the inside space it offers and so far accommodates bakeware I already have.\n \n  This is an awesome oven. Cooks well looks good. And the size is fantastic.\n \n  So far this oven is good. The controls are not that easy to use.  I still can\u2019t figure out how to turn it off without unplugging it.\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster oven.\n \n  Just as pictured, looks elegant in kitchen, easy to use, works great & easy to clean!\n \n  Great price amazon warehouse . Works perfect.\n \n  Excellent on all fronts\n \n  I like this, very  practical and a time saver\n \n  I really liked this product it is very convinent. I can easily cook anything from cakes to roast chicken. The oven cooks fast and evenly. Though it's a nice oven to cook in, I have to say the only thing I don't like to much are the doors.\n \n  i've only used it about every day since i bought it.\n ", "\n  Love this little oven. Great visual of what\u2019s cooking and cleans easily. It does give off a lot of heat so be certain to allow for ventilation. I have no regrets. Great purchase.\n \n  I love it it\u2019s so easy to use one touch\n \n  This is one of the Best kitchen countertop appliances I have ever had....it looks & works Great!\n \n  Wonderful oven! It heats up quickly and cools down just as quick.\n \n  So far, this product replace my regular oven for 90% of the time, with great satisfaction.\n \n  Best oven ever\n \n  Big\n \n  Best product purchase this year\n \n  We have used this at our office nearly everyday with great results for Pizza, chicken, ham, pies.\n \n  Love it!\n ", "\n  This is a great small oven. You can make anything you want in it. It\u2019s Awesome!\n \n  I really love it. Its big enough to make a large pizza. I make mostly everything in here bc i love it.\n \n  like how it works, had to get usted to\n \n  Once I learned to use it, I got very good results, even baking pizza!\n \n  Inside shelf is not adjustable.\n \n  My wall oven broke years ago and I have gone through at least 12 toaster ovens.  This one is so classy looking. Love the French. Doors. It cooks beautifully. It\u2019s like.  It cooks like a full size oven.\n \n  Reheating pizza\n \n  It cooks unevenly unfortunately\n \n  Looks great and works well. We use it daily. Toast, fish cakes, pizza, baked haddock, you name it!

Has good space and works quick.\n \n  I live my little oven\n \n  I love this tabletop oven\n ", "\n  I like everything in this oven, size, controls, inside illumination, the doors, very accurate temp... The only problem I have is broiling. The bottom filament also turns on during broil, and doesn't broil as hot as other similar ovens. Ends up over cooking food when you needed to just broil. Not sure if this is only on my unit or if other people have experience similar issue.\n \n  Well packaged an amazing arrival time.\n \n  Perfect for our needs!\n \n  Bello\n \n  This is an upgrade from the old Oster we had and its great, love the lighting feature. Its big but looks elegant\n \n  Was a little smaller than I wanted but works great for making cookies and toasting subs.\n \n  Does great\n \n  Love this oven!\n \n  The oven works great but be aware that the top gets quite hot so it could be a problem under a cabinet.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Its amazing!\n ", "\n  I just moved to a place w/o an oven but I love to cook. This unit can handle 90% of what I use a conventional oven for but fits the space restrictions I currently have. Absolutely recommend this product!\n \n  Excelente\n \n  I like this oven very much. I had the digital with a single door but like the digital French door with a inside light more. Gave the single door to my sister and she loves it too. I use it as my number one oven.\n \n  Very easy to use , faster and cleaner than oven. I don\u2019t feel like it puts off a lot of outside heat ( some other reviews comments reflected this ) .\n \n  I love it!\n \n  The oven does not cook evenly and tends to burn most things on bake or turbo even if watched very carefully. \n  This is what we had been logging for, Very easy to use and we like the Light when in use Feature...  Very good product\n \n  I like every thing about it.\n \n  Great oven\n \n  I\u2019m glad we bought this oven we have it out by the pool/patio and the kids use it all the time for there pizza and heating up there food.\n ", "\n  They tray should be non stick its hard to clean.\n \n  I like the size! We use it every day. We got rid of the microwave after buying this. It dose take longer to make stuff in this than a microwave but this is way healthier to use.\n \n  Use this more than my regular oven. Love the french doors.\n \n  The door open making a lot easier to get your food out of the oven, over pulling down the door handle. There are presets that makes it a one touch operation.\n \n  It looks great but the doors close on you when you remove food.  I burned myself several times and I\u2019m returning it.  It\u2019s dangerous.  It needs a mechanism to hold doors open.\n \n  when i bought this beast of an oven i wasn't sure what to expect, but when i got it worked out perfectly. i was able to fit a 15lbs gobbler in it with ease.\n \n  Takes longer than expected to get up to temperature.\n \n  The cord is too short!\n \n  Its very easy to clean. Cooks nicely. It does have a hot spot. Adjusting the time for cooking could be easier.\n \n  Love this oven so easy to use\n ", "\n  how hot the doors get you should tell the customer before they buy it.\n \n  Absolutely in love with this oven\n \n  The toaster is okay but everything else works great\n \n  I like it but it\u2019s not working good .I need help.Please help me .The upper heating eliment is not working.My family need it everyday thank you.\n \n  Great oven!

As well as the present times are spot on.\n \n  This came in handy for thanksgiving\n \n  Overall, solid appliance. I have found the need to rotate items that require longer cook times to avoid overcooking on one side.\n \n  Love this oven ! Simple to use and it cooks things quicker than my big oven. I highly recommend this product !\n ", "\n  Haven't used much yet.  Love the way it looks in the kitchen and can't wait to use it more.\n \n  This oven is more than I expected!\n \n  Liked the French doors.

When/If this one breaks...I\u2019ll order another one.\n \n  the oven was great then it was not, stopped working after 5 months\n \n  Great Oven\n \n  I absolutely love this oven.\n \n  It's easy to use and very efficient. Also a nice size.\n \n  You get what you paid for. Cheaply made!! It sucks!! Spend the money and buy a better brand.\n \n  Small\n \n  I can not tell you how much I love this oven.  I have cooked only in this since I got it.  Anything that needs to be baked or roasted in a conventional oven can be cooked in this.  I have baked a pumpkin bread pudding, roasted chicken, and heated other various things in this oven.  I bought it so I could save my propane during the winter.  I would highly recommend this.\n \n  There\u2019s nothing I dislike.\n \n  Amazing cooks so fast my mom loves it!\n ", "\n  Item worked well. Very satisfied.\n \n  its the perfect second oven. I've roasted an 8 lb. chicken, bread, cake, brownies, mac and cheese all with perfect results. this oven is the best investment I've made in a long time. I love it. the convection function is great and its easy to keep clean.\n \n  jUST GOT TODAY.\n \n  N/a\n \n  Good for pizza\n \n  I love this oven. I use it every day. I have abandoned my big oven for the most part unless I have a larger casserole that wont fit in it that I might be making for a party or my LARGE cookie sheets.\n \n  Love everything about it!\n \n  Works as good as my smaller older Oster model did that finally died after 5 years. This model adds the preheat function, dual racks, much bigger inner chamber and is stainless steel. My old oven I had to bend up two edges of my 12\" pizza pan for it to fit and this ovan holds a 14\" pizza pan with ease. The model below this one is basicly the same without the french doors and hire price. You're basically paying extra for the french doors over the standard door.\n \n  Wife loves to cook with it so much can get her to turn on the regular stove\n \n  Love this oven. I had to remove an old non-working wall oven, and found it would be very expensive to have another one installed. So I bought this oven & put in the same space as the old wall oven (after painting the space). It is large enough for anything I need to bake, and so far is doing a great job. I use the Warm setting to heat plates and keep food from getting cold. Have baked pizza, roasted veggies, pork roast etc. and everything turned out great. I have had good luck with Oster products in the past, and this one lives up to that expectation! Recommend!\n ", "\n  Ok oven but doesn't cook even.  The back of the oven must get hotter so have you have to rotate everything.\n \n  The Oster oven works well and cooks quicker than my full size gas oven. Cons: It was so much bigger than I had imagined, not a regular sized toaster oven for sure and  I wish the buttons beeped or at least were easier to press. It is difficult for me to press them and know they are working (no sound).  Overall I am pleased with it so far.  The price on Amazon was much cheaper than the other online retailers.\n \n  Gave it to my daughter, she uses it everyday but must warn that the doors get really hot!\n \n  Really like this one. It is large and works wonderfully. Cooks evenly.\n \n  Wife loves it.  Uses it all the time.\n \n  I will say it is a good product by far.  I am amazed at how well the food has been cooking. It is easy to clean as well.\n \n  This easily fits a Papa Murphy's large pizza and cooks two at-a-time nicely.  Four stars instead of five because the outside gets really hot (you could easily burn yourself touching the top), which may be typical for devices like these, but even the tiniest bit of insulation would be helpful.  I really like the french doors. Also (although I find it annoying sometimes), I like that you have to set a timer (like a microwave) rather being able to leave it on until you remember to turn it off (like an oven). It's also light, so it's easy to take out and put away whenever it's not needed.\n \n  We ordered the Oster oven before Thanksgiving and it was amazing how much we used it as a 'second oven', especially since the turkey took up so much room in our kitchen oven. As a result everything was hot as we brought it to our dinner table. We use it regularly now and are so pleased to have made this purchase. Since it was sold out on QVC, we were so happy to have found it on Amazon for such a great price!\n \n  Very satisfied with this oven; baked pork roast and cherry turn overs and did turn out pretty good! Bought it as a back up oven since my new large oven was back ordered and had to wait almost a month to receive it . If I didn't already ordered the new range with stove I would be content with Osters toaster oven.\n \n  This oven does everything, and I don't have to heat up my kitchen using my regular oven.  I can't wait til Thanksgiving.  It's going to be so nice to be able to cook casseroles in this oven while my turkey cooks In the big oven.\n ", "\n  I really like this, I am very happy with it,the quality is very good, I would buy it again. I have to change my mind on the quality of this product. I have noticed that the clock will not hold the correct time, And the doors will not close tight anymore, I am just sick to pay so much for a product that is not showing me that it's not a quality oven.do not buy this.\n \n  Took a short time to get used to it, but once we were, we just loved it. Great that the light stays on while it's cooking.  Would recommend to anyone.  Thanks a lot.\n \n  Excellent product. Cooks as well as any full size oven I have used. Temp is dead on heat is even. Clean up is fast and easy if spills.\n \n  Best investment I made in a toaster oven. Its beautiful and it works awesome. I use it everyday so far and no issues. I would purchase again.\n \n  Great oven!  Cooks and toasts perfectly.  Very Spacious, but fits in my counter space perfectly.  Have not tried convection yet.  Warming function is best for keeping food warm, not reheating.  If the rack slid out when the doors opened it would be the perfect oven.\n \n  I love this so much, I wish I had bought one years ago.  I use it almost every day.  Excellent addition to my kitchen!\n \n  Would definitely buy this one again.  Haven't even used my big oven since receiving this one.\n \n  Love this convenient nicely styled oven. Use it almost daily. It's easy to clean and like the French doors and with only two of us I don't have to use our regular large oven. Only negative is that I would like the touch controls to respond a little easier.\n \n  It more than meets expectations. I love the french doors.  I was constantly burning my arms on the old style door that opened from the top. \n  High quality, highly recommended! Love the convection part of it. I use this daily!!\n ", "\n  I just bought this oven to keep from using my big oven and heating up the kitchen.  My problem is that the french doors do not meet.  There is approximately 1/8 of an inch between them and this lets so much heat escape.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I think I may have to take this oven back due to this.\n \n  I replace this Oster with a older Oster. Although my older Oster still worked, I just wanted this new one and it hasn't disappointed me.\n \n  Use almost every day. Like the double doors.  Would recommend.\n \n  Great product. We use it all the time. Well worth the money. \n  Looks and works great.\n \n  We use it daily. No meal is to small or to big.\n \n  real nice oven\n None None None \n  \u00a0This is really a nice looking, high end counter top oven. It is also on the high end of prices. It is a quality unit, with all of the features you could want for a small oven. Oster Extra Large Capacity Countertop 6-Slice Digital Convection Toaster Oven, Stainless Steel, TSSTTVDGXL-SHP \n  I've had this oven for about a month and i am thoroughly impressed. No tricks or gimmicks it just looks and works beautifully!\n \n  I love this oven. Big and spacious.\n ", "\n  Love love love it\n \n  I cook for three and it works great for most meals. I would like more options for placing the shelves. I also wish the doors didn't snap shut if not fully open. I have not used all the options yet but look forward to great food.\n \n  works great\n \n  I love this oven.  It is tall enough to bake large loaves of bread and tall sponge and angel-food cakes - which is one of the reasons I picked it. \n  so far im in love\n \n  Love my oven, easy to use. I love the doors they make the oven easier to open.  When I had question the company was able to answer them for me.\n \n  Great toaster oven. Highly recommended.\n \n  Absolutely wonderful. Very large with MANY functions I was not even expecting. Really attractive. I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.\n \n  \"Big Oven\" \n  My husband loves this oven...especially the French doors\n ", "\n  so far so good....still trying to figure out if the toast function is as good as a regular toaster.\n \n  Really great oven.\n \n  The product is very good. I am happy with this purchase.\n \n  I am someone who has dreamed of having two ovens for I don\u2019t know how long.  My kitchen is small and the Viking range I lust over is just not going to happen.  I like to bake and cook and having one oven has really made me learn how to juggle and preplan accordingly. \n  Not sure how much I like it since I haven't had it that long.\n \n  I read most of the reviews and decided that the lower star reviews were submitted by people that had problems with items I didn't care about( counter too small for doors to open?) Or they compared this to a full size oven. In some cases just user error. One reviewer gave it 1 star because she plugged multiple appliances into the same outlet and it tripped the breaker?!  Lastly this is not going to be used as a kitchen clock so I won't be reviewing the accuracy of the clocks time keeping ability. \n  Great investment! Don't even hesitate\n \n  There are four major problems with this unit, which is imported junk from China. First, the temperature fluctuates. Second, the unit's internal thermometer is inaccurate (e.g., it shows itself as having heated to 375 degrees, while in fact a separate oven thermometer shows it to be merely 325 degrees--and no, it's not that the unit is always fifty degrees off; see the first problem). Third, the unit cooks unevenly. Fourth, the glass doors get very hot and will, if you're not extremely careful, slam on your hands and burn you as you're taking things out.\n \n  This counter-top oven has pros and cons. I feel though for the price it shouldn't have so many cons. PROS: deeper, wider, and a little higher than most counter-top ovens, can fit a 9x13\" pan, has an interior light. CONS: would have been nice to have an oven rack rail in the center so a rack could be adjusted to cook mid oven thus not too close to top heating element or bottom heating element, can not turn light off, after setting temperature it will not display temperature, very small gap between door sides in center allowing for too much heat to escape, cooking temperature is off (for my oven temperature is about 25 lower than for what is set), if doors are not fully open they will swing shut forcefully - not ideal for safety, control panel \"touch\" sensitivity should be better, could be better made for the price.\n \n  The oven is great, but the price is jacked up. You can go the the Oster website and buy this for more than $100.00 less.\n ", "\n  I have been using this oven for a few months now and more and more have come to regret the purchase.  Today, I preheated the oven on the 350 setting.  I always use an oven thermometer and it was running hot so I attempted to lower it 10 degrees.  No luck.  The oven only allows you to bake in 25 degree increments.  The timer is the same also.  I have to use a separate timer because it doesn't allow you to set the exact time you want nor increase it just a few minutes .  There is also about an 1/8 inch gap between the french doors that allows heat to escape.  To be efficient, you will need to add some oven gasket material to close the gap.  I had a Breville Countertop oven for many years that finally needed replacing.  Unfortunately, I thought this Oster would be good at a lower price.  You  get what you pay for rings true with the Oster.  There is a reason it cost considerable less.  It looks pretty, but doesn't function at all as expected.  It is not a true oven.  The fact that everything is preset without the ability to manage what you are baking, toasting, or cooking makes it more a hassle to use than heating up the big oven.  The larger size is nice  hence the 3 stars.\n \n  have not used it yet but previous use of other model tells me don't worry.\n \n  I bought this oven through QVC early in 2018 and have used it fairly often.  I must say that it's a great addition to my kitchen and is great to have when you have a big meal to prepare and need some extra oven space.  Even with a double-oven gas range, sometimes still I have needed more oven space, and this does the trick.  Two 13x9 dishes will fit inside at once, if you're really pressed (though those dishes need to have no handles or very small handles on the sides, in order to fit, width-wise).  Lots of space in there and the push-out in the back gives you loads of room for large pizzas.  It's rather stylish-looking, too. \n  The reason for the three stars is the difficulty in setting the temp. I do not know if mine is faulty but the display kept resetting back to the beginning. Very frustrating. The manual leaves much to be desired. Buy a book; buy a book; buy a book The digital controls make setting cooking for recipes that need two temperatures a bit of a pill, but hey, it isn't a perfect world. As of 2018, this is probably the best countertop out there. \n  I've had my oven for 4 months.  In that time, the toast function has stopped working and so has the broiler.  When the toast feature worked it took over 6 minutes to produce toast.  I think this is over designed.  It never did work as well as previous ovens I've owned.  It's expensive and it doesn't work.  Not something I'd recommend.\n \n  We love toaster ovens and use them more often than we use our regular oven.  Although this is a beautiful appliance and it's very spacious inside, it's huge on a counter top and gets HOT, much hotter than any other toaster oven we've owned. I can feel the heat a foot away from it.  It warped my cabinet doors, so you may want to have them open when using.  I don't like that the timer automatically starts as soon as it's preheated and I don't like that the timer only goes in five minute increments.  Kind of having some buyers remorse with this one :(\n \n  The broiler element does not get hot enough to do a qood job broiling meat or making toast porperly.\n \n  the oven came through fine i have been sick with a virus so have not had a chance to try it but will\n \n  The big concern is the spring loaded doors. They can close on you when you think the doors are open and burn you as you put your food in to pre-heated oven or take out.  Ouch!  I've been burned a couple of times when I thought it was open and now have a 2nd degree burn on my arm.  So be careful if you buy this. \n  It is a great little oven.  It will take a family size pizza, and cook it evenly.  I use this over my full size oven for mosts things I bake. ", "\n  The oven gave off so much heat that it heated the whole kitchen. As others have noted, there's a significant gap between the doors, which lets out considerable heat.  Even with the 'turbo convection', it did not heat evenly.  The toast did not toast evenly either and it took forever to toast.\n \n  Temperature control is fine as long as you don\u2019t use convection. It does not properly circulate hot air. You end up with scorch areas on your food. \n  Maybe I received a damaged unit, mine overcooks everything way too fast even with the convection fan OFF, it makes my cakes rise much to quickly, burns the bottoms and leaves the centers wet and gelatinous. And with the convection fan on, forget about it! My angelfoodcake nearly overflowed and the bottom burned black without even starting to cook the middle. Maybe oster doesn't know the difference between bake and broil. It's cute though! It will make perfectly burned food in the cutest way possible!\n \n  I just bought this and it seems great! It fits a papa Murphy\u2019s Family size pizza and it cooks great.  It is sitting on our broken oven in case you were wondering.  The cord is very short and it isn\u2019t in the middle, it is on the right side.\n \n  It\u2019s a little hard to write a full proper review as I\u2019ve only had this unit for a few weeks. I\u2019ve toasted in it probably three times but tonight I went to make a sweet potato and it took forever on bake so I wound up taking it out and putting it in the microwave. While eating my microwaved sweet potato I thought I\u2019d look up some reviews. I\u2019m now thinking I also needed to press turbo convection button? Anyway, I also found the unit to be very very loud. Is anyone else having that issue? It\u2019s about as loud as my microwave which I was not expecting. Would love some feedback. I\u2019m also new to the convection oven users club so maybe I\u2019m doing something else wrong? Due to the noise, the minimal instruction pamphlet and the extremely short cord at this time I\u2019d have to give it 3 stars.\n \n  I bought one of the French door toaster ovens at Costco for the same price, and after about a week the stainless steal was impossible to clean it looks like I\u2019ve had it for years, it takes forever to preheat and it\u2019s extraordinarily loud. I don\u2019t record you buy this, I did and I can\u2019t get a refund because I lost my receipt.\n \n  Didn't get this from amazon, found a better deal. That said, this oven is fantastic. It's not a toaster oven, It's a real oven than can cook almost everything a regular home oven can. It cooks evenly and has convection which is amazing.. My only complaints are that it takes a long time to preheat, power cord is to short and this thing puts off a lot of heat. Given that, It works great and I would certainly recommend it\n \n  I bought this at Costco. There is so much wrong with it. \n  Kinda liked this when I bought it at Costco. My breville was smaller but had more features but I liked this size. The toasting worked ok but the doors had a gap so it lost heat and took longer to cook things. Then out of nowhere the unit died. No warning and only 2 months old. Costco stopped carrying it and I could not return it so it was a waste of money. Save the risk and buy breville.\n \n  I've had this oven for 16 months and it just died. I loved the features on the oven and used it on a regular basis. Very unhappy that it's no longer working. I won't be buying another Oster for a replacement.\n ", "\n  This is even better than I expected. It's ready to use right out of the box, there is no setup or assembly required; just insert the trays, plug it in and you're ready to cook. Although it's large, it's surprisingly light and easy to lift out of the box and onto the counter, where it looks great. This is a really nice looking machine. The buttons are digital (like microwave buttons) and include buttons for the following: Toast, Broil, Pizza, Defrost, Bake, Warm, Turbo-convection (I haven't tried that one, yet!) and, my favorite, Dehydrate. It literally has everything I could want, and it uses less energy than my regular oven. I have been using this daily since I received it two weeks ago and I absolutely love it.\n \n  I've used a few times with good results. Only complaint is the heat on the top outside of the oven.\n \n  The spacious french door design is fantastic; however the oven is poorly insulated and the radiating heat is far greater than other counter ovens (including gap between doors). The heating element is slow to reach temp, and the bell is loud without an option to silence. On the positive- it's pretty\n \n  Great oven!!!!\n \n  Oven worked great .But I woke up one morning to find the French doors had shattered. I have tried to contact Oster, without any luck. So if you buy this oven, I wish you more luck than I had. I don\u2019t think I will tell anyone else to own this ,the Oster company stinks. Service is about as bad as it gets.\n \n  Spring loaded doors will burn you if you don\u2019t make sure they lock open. Lasted 6 months then lights started flashing and it doesn\u2019t work. \n  I\u2019ve been using this oven for Everything!!! Love it. Does a great job for all. \n  The doors will not stay open, you have to use one hand to open doors.  You have the other to pull out heavy dish.  Bad idea.  Temp does not match on display screen and reality by internal oven thermometer.  Temp goes from 350 to 375.  Can not put in 360.  I have to try to find other one. :(  Marty F\n \n  Got it from Costco for $139.99.  The turbo fan thingy does little to nothing but I don't care because IT'S A GIANT TOASTER!!!  Works great for toast and reheating stuff you you never feel justified turning the big oven on for.\n \n  We love ours! We purchased it in copper at Qvc at a better price! It  works great and my hubby loves cooking & or baking in it as do I.  It\u2019s a beautiful addition to our home. Love the French foord & digital functions.\n ", "\n  I use mine daily.  My only complaint is that the doors can\u2019t stay open.  When you are putting a dish in the oven you have to maneuver both the doors and the dish.  If you are holding your dish with both hands, opening the doors requires balancing the dish while opening doors.  Have gotten a couple of minor burns trying to juggle this.  Other than this I love this product.\n \n  The light bulb went out and new one is very hard to find.  Finally found the light bulb but I am still looking for a new light bulb cover.  My original cover fell off the table and broke.  Tried several sources online and Oster but still have not found the cover for the light bulb.  Model # TSSTTVFDDG.  Replacement parts should not be this hard to find.\n \n  What are the interior dimensions? Will my 17-1/4\" X 11-1/4\" X 2-3/4\" lasagna pan fit into it to bake?\n \n  I use this for anything that needs to be cooked in a oven it takes so long to preheat I could use my full size oven.  With the cap in the door it makes it very hot all around the oven.  I would not recommend this product.\n \n  I can fit a 9x11 pan in this. It is amazing how much it can hold. You could actually make a full meal in this oven. It is quiet when it runs. There is also a nice cooking light so,I can actually see how things are cooking. The doors take a little getting used to. My old oven had the lull down door. These you just pull one door open and both open at once. You just have to be sure to pull it all the way open or else it will close. Cooks very nicely. Preheats pretty quickly. So far so good. Will update if a anything changes.\n \n  The doors have given me a couple of burns. I have learned to pull out the shelf to prop open the door. Sometimes they have slammed shut on my hands. Just be careful.\n \n  The oven is great, but it lasted about 10 months; my previous \"cheap\" toaster oven lasted at least six years....very disappointed :-(\n \n  Does not toast or broil properly-elements don't heat up enough.\n \n  We love this thing.  A feeling helped particularly because of our oven, which we hate. \n  Purchased on QVC, awesome purchase. Very happy with it.\n ", "\n  I'm not impressed by the Oster Digital French Door Oven. \n  The listed dimensions on this product are not correct. It is 21.5 in wide, 14 inches deep (for oven itself) plus must have 6 in. clearance on back for the vent system so allow 20 inches for depth, and its is 13 inches high.\n \n  Didn't served my purpose,takes very long time,waste of money.\n \n  I bought this oven to use while our kitchen is under repair. I must say I am not a fan of toaster ovens but this oven is amazing! First of all its huge with the back of the oven rounded out so you can place a pizza pan in the oven. You can remove a rack so you could put in a nice size roasting pan.  I put a few pans in to give an idea of then space inside of the oven. There is a crumb catcher that covers the very bottom and one between the racks th cover in the middle. The doors stay open until you close them. If you only open them a little they will close back on their own. It is stainless steel. Very nice looking.  This will be a great second oven even after the kitchen repairs. It also has a dehydrating mode! I can't wait to make my beef jerky in this oven.\n \n  I have to call this unit a keeper.  This unit is replacing my Breville.BOV800XL which got me 10 years down the road.  The Oster French Door has a very professional look to it, and the eye candy is Amazing.  The unit does a fantastic job of baking bread.  It just arrived today and I will need to get use to it, but for starters I think it is fantastic,  Very user friendly.  First attempt, the control button were a little tricky.  Second attempt the control buttons issue resolved.  The Tray/Cutting-board designed for the top of Breville fits the Oster very nicely.  Very Happy Camper..  I would recommend to anyone that can cook...  12/03 Saturday morning update:  Toast and cookies are a snap with this unit.  12/6 update:  The unit bakes a wonderful 12\" single layer 2 box Carrot Cake.  12/10 Pork Roast in the works with all the trimmings.  Pork Roast and trimmings have been placed in a Chicken Bag (sold on Amazon.com of course) then placed in a corning-ware dutch oven.  And Wallah!!  All Thanks To Amazon.com \n  While planning to remodel the kitchen, I purchased this countertop oven so that we could cook while the kitchen is down.  It arrived very quickly, well packaged.  Easy to set up and extremely easy to operate.  I have no doubt temperature fluctuates -- it is a countertop oven, not much larger than a large microwave and it is made light weight so that you can easily move it.  It is not a range oven or wall oven that is heavy duty and extremely insulated; so I did not expect for it to hold temperature rock steady.  Heated smoked wings the first night -- just a heating up of something already cooked.  The oven did perfectly fine.  We use a meat thermometer; so we cooked a cut up chicken the next time and placed the meat thermometer in the breast and simply cooked it until the internal temp was accurate.  Came out great; juicy.  Next meal we heated two 10\" pizza's.  One on each rack.  I placed them at opposite corners so the pizza's only overlapped a couple inches.  Both cooked; the top one cooked as well as the bottom one.  I think the racks would accommodate a fairly large pizza as the two 10\" almost fit on one rack.  The doors will stay open if opened all the way -- that is the key.  Both can be closed by pushing on only one door.  I did not find this counter top oven to heat up the kitchen.  As it cook I periodically placed my hand near the doors, top and sides to see if I could feel heat radiating and I did not find anything noticeable.  Of course when you open the doors heat will escape as it does with a traditional oven.  I think it took between 10 and 15 minutes to preheat up to 425* F.  We simply prepare the food while the oven is preheating.  It is ready when we are ready to load it.  If you do not set a temperature and time, it looks like it automatically begins preheating itself for 350*F and automatically starts a timer at around 20 minutes.  So you can just hit start and then quickly adjust the temp and timer when you are ready to put the food in.  It chimes when the set temp is reached and as the internal light, which is fairly bright, stays in during baking, it goes off when the timer goes off and the oven shuts itself off.  It does have a dehydrate and convection options: but I have never used that before so I have not tried it yet.  I did find it hard to clean the crumb tray at the bottom, located under the lower heating elements.  Juices from the wings did drip down and baked onto the tray.  Got it cleaned; then placed a piece of aluminum foil over the tray, making sure it was flat and not touching the elements; problem solved.  The chord is short but we use an extension chord rated for appliances and it seems to be working fine.  We do not clutter or crowd it; keeping a good 6\" clearance space on either side and we do not place anything on top of it.  Overall I think I made a good purchase.  Not the cheapest option, not the most expensive option -- mid range.  If it holds up during our remodel, we will keep it and plan to use it in the future, at a weekend cabin we plan on building in the hill country.  Thank you.\n \n  I bought this to save money on electricity and not heating my kitchen up in the summer like a full oven does, becuase I bake so much. My electric bill dropped by $60 a month using this. I bake a lot of bread, this works great and only take 4 minutes to preheat! None None None \n  \u00a0I absolutely LOVE this oven!! U can bake/use convection, set timers etc. it came packaged perfectly and as soon as I received it I used it. You have to remember it cooks quicker n hotter than your regular oven... I know bcuz I burnt a pizza \ud83c\udf55... but I made my ENTIRE Thanksgiving dinner in this oven!  Everything cooked perfectly!\n \n  After having all of my standard cooking appliances (convection/microwave, gas range) fail miserably in baking and cooking even simple casseroles, I bought this unit.  It is huge, fitting even the largest pizza and pizza stone, easily a 13x9, and nearly everything but a large rectangle cookie sheet.  This is a true oven, even toasts bread like a toaster, broils and dehydrates.  I literally use it every day and love it!  I wish I could replace the other built in appliances with it , but it does need space around it for venting and the round back makes the unit very deep.  I am fortunate to have counter space in the 5th wheel for it, and am glad I do.  It's an awesome oven, just wish it were a bit smaller.\n \n  I got this oven because I bought a house with an icky 1960s 24\" wall oven, which will require a cabinet reconfiguration.  Until then, I have been using this Oster countertop oven.  My experience has been that it cooks the food just as fast as, if not sooner than, my former regular oven.  I have baked a casserole, heated a 16\" pizza (yes, the pizza pan fit!) cooked crab cakes, and broiled pork chops.  This oven does exactly what I purchased it for and it looks attractive on my countertop.  I am not regretting buying this!\n ", "\n  Our 30 year old wall oven died in October.  We're planning on remodeling the entire kitchen after the first of the year, so we didn't want to replace it.  We picked up this counter top oven to use in the interim.  So far, it has worked fine for everything we've cooked in it - we're cooking a roast in it as I type this.  Simply by setting it on \"Bake\" and then setting the timer and temperature, it has worked fine for everything that we've cooked so far and cooking times have been about the same as our regular oven.  It's not heavily insulated (or insulated at all really), so it's not going to hold as steady of a temperature as a \"real\" oven, but like I said, it's close enough that the cooking times have been fairly accurate.  The doors took us about 1 or 2 uses to get used to.  The first time my wife shut them, she let go and they slammed.  After that, we got it.  There is a slight gap between the 2 doors, but that is by design.  We haven't used the convection functionality nor anything else but \"Bake\" for that matter.  The only thing that has annoyed us so far is the timer - it can't be set for more than 90 minutes, so for the roast we're cooking right now, we have to reset the timer before it ends and turns off the oven.  We haven't tried to bake cakes or anything \"fancy\" in this.  Works fine for the cookies we've made.  Our children are grown, so we're cooking for just 2.  Not sure this would work for a large family.  It does heat up the kitchen, but since it's winter, that's welcome.  In the summer, maybe not so much.\n \n  It's not as sophisticated as my Breville toaster oven, but it's quite a bit larger.  I bought it to make my own healthy pizza, which I make with nonfat cheese.  I wanted it to make jerky, as well, but for the immediate future, I'm now a vegetarian, except for some seafood, for health reasons, so the jerky is out, for now.  It was definitely worth the price and works well for my uses.  The pizza comes out crisp and is pretty fast, using my pizza tray, although I use the convection setting, because you can't adjust the temp control in the pizza setting.  I also found that baking it on the bottom rack works best.  In the middle position, the cheese tends to get brown, before the dough gets crispy.\n \n  Used a month, then timer failed & oven will not turn off now - I have to unplug it when finished. \n  WONDERFUL LITTLE UNIT. OPEN THE DOORS ALL THE WAY WHEN USING. DON'T BE AN IDIOT AND BURN YOURSELF LIKE SOME HAVE DONE. CLEANING IS A SNAP. READ THE MANUEL. THAT IS WHY A MANUEL IS SENT. AGAIN, DON'T BE AN IDIOT AND BURN YOURSELF ON THE DOORS. IT TOOK ME EXACTLY ONE PRACTICE TRY TO MAKE SURE I KNEW HOW TO OPEN THE DOORS. ONE TRY ! THE LITTLE OPENING BETWEEN THE DOORS IS NOT AN ISSUE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FULL SIZE OVEN THAT WAS AIR TIGHT DEARIE...STOP BEING SUCH A MILLENNIAL....YOU'RE EXHAUSTING.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY. IGNORE THE IDIOT REVIEWS AND BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.  !\n \n  update: Control panel caught on fire, could not find warrantee info on Amazon or Oster website.  It could have burned down our kitchen. \n  I wanted a decent sized \"countertop\" oven - and this works perfectly.  I can fit a full casserole in it - I baked a homemade lasagna that I had frozen in pyrex. Was done in 90 minutes, just as expected.  Preheats quickly. The automatic timer is a little annoying but you can override it.  The toast function is just ok; not any worse than making toast in a regular oven - takes a while because of the \"volume\" of space. I dont use it for toast tho so not an issue for me.  I have used the convection and it definitely makes a difference.  The oven is on a counter with nothing above it, but the top surface and back don't really get that hot.  I think you could put it under a cupboard with minimal risk. The front tho - the glass - hot glass is hot.  The french door design is wonderful - all the reviews discussing exploding glass are NOT talking about this model.  You just have to not be a dork and try to push the doors farther open with your arm while you are holding a dish.  The doors anchor open perfectly well when you open them all the way ...using the handle...like a normal human.  Open the doors, put in the dish. close the doors. With the handle. No bandaids required. It's a perfect device and well worth the price.\n \n  We are remodeling a tiny house.I bought this oven a little bit early and just got it out of the box after having it stored in our storage for 2 months.it did not meet my expectations. The French doors do not meet in the center so there is a gap that will let heat release out of the oven. There is no glass seal around the door. The inside is stainless steel so how easy will it be to clean? I've had toaster ovens before and I got rid of them and replaced because they get too nasty to use and they're hard to clean. This little convection oven reminds me more of a toaster oven. The price is was right but I need to upgrade and get a better model\n \n  Wife likes it and it replaced the exact same Oster convection oven as our last... same digital touch pad layout and features. Only 2 new differences are the french doors and interior oven light. And the doors seem to stay open when completely retracted. Now here's something important... you will need about an extra 3-5 inches on EACH side of this oven's left to right (end-to-end) dimensions in order for these french doors to completely open and click to stay open without auto retracting and closing on you. And despite some of these reviews that say this oven allows extra heat to escape through the middle gap where the french doors close hasn't been a noticeable issue for us. Easy to clean? Hmmm... our prior Oster oven model that carbon copies this one (which still completely works fine)... took it into the garage to clean it up and it took me several hours to get it to look sparkling new... which included the glass on both sides, exterior stainless and interior. And should you use oven cleaner (Easy Off) like I did, beware... the inside metal became stained in some way due to the corrosive cleaning chemicals. Sure, all the gunk and grease came off, but now there are discolored blotches on the inside metal... no biggie to me, but just an FYI.\n \n  UPDATE OCTOBER 7, 2016:  This is a response and an update to my Oster review. I have used this oven all summer and have found the oven works very well and I highly recommend it. \n  This is the perfect kitchen addition.  I can make crispy french fries without oil, crispy frozen burritos or chimichangas.  The special pizza setting will bake a large frozen pizza perfectly without having to make adjustments to the setting.  It does everything.  Bake, toast, convection, defrost, dehydrate.  I use it every day.\n ", "\n  I love this oven. The convection feature is wonderful--cooks faster than a regular oven. (I read 25% faster) The only problem I hve is that it does NOT hold a 16\" pizza. My 16\" round pizza pan will not fit inside. I measured, and the pan is exactly 16\". I put a pizza directly on the rack and had to fold the edges on the sides. Otherwise, it's a great oven.\n \n  My wife saw this model, and we bought it as an upgrade to our older Oster countertop oven which we have used a lot over the past five years.  It's a bit larger capacity than the older, single-door model; and the \"french\" doors are more convenient than the \"tail-gate\" door on our old oven.  With just the two of us, we have found that most baking can be done in the countertop oven rather than the kitchen range oven, and most frying, boiling and cooking can be done on an induction cooktop rather than the four-burner kitchen range top.\n \n  It is hard to find pans that will fit it this. I find that it does not cook evenly. touch pad is difficult to use. It is not very sensitive.\n \n  Room enough to bake the average frozen pizza. Heat and timer settings require some trial and error. Keypad sensitivity needs improvement: I sometimes have to press 2, even 3 times to press precisely on center for a response, but with use I'm improving my touch. FYI: both glass doors open when pulling on only one of the door handles, which takes some getting used to but is convenient.  All in all, a very good and versatile counter oven for the price\n \n  Bought this to use  in the garage to keep the summer heat out of the house. Perfect size and performs like a regular oven. The only adjustment I have to make is the temp runs hot. So I just cook every thing 25 degrees cooler. No big deal. Glad I perchased it.\n \n  My kitchen has limited space, so I ended up with a space-saving gas range. Though it\u2019s cooktop does a satisfactory job, it\u2019s oven is wildly inconsistent. Since replacing it with a higher-end unit is not possible, I opted for this Oster French Door Toaster Oven.  It is very easy to setup, works as expected and performed perfectly in its initial use (baking). \n  I have wanted a toaster oven large enough to fit casseroles and roasts in for some time. I was debating between this and a cheaper version and I am so glad I got this. It's a nice alternative to always using the oven and also really nice when there just isnt enough room in the oven for everything. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a stay on function. The timer maxes at 90 minutes. Which isn't a major issue because it isnt hard to just extend the timer and most dishes are done within 90 minutes anyway.\n \n  It's a roomy enough oven for small pans or anything up to a 7 lb. turkey breast.  In terms of accuracy, however, it leaves a lot to be desired.  We set the oven temperature to 325, and used two thermometers to validate the results.  One was a digital probe-style inserted into the meat, the other was an in-oven thermometer.  The digital read the oven temperature at 307, while the in-oven registered slightly above 275!  It's quite a deviation.  I wouldn't trust the settings on the oven, but use a thermometer to see what temperature you are really cooking at.\n \n  The first one I received had to be replaced because after toasting for 7 minutes the bread was not toasted. Now after using the replacement oven for 3 plus months I can no longer use it because each time the oven. Is turned on there is a strong electrical smell and am afraid of a fire.  When I contacted the seller I was told it was no longer his problem.\n \n  I absolutely love this oven. I recently moved into an apartment and the stove was a big disappointment. In my house my stove had a digital oven and it provides accurate cooking temps. This oven is digital and so easy to use. I definitely recommend. I bought mine from the warehouse and got a terrific deal on it. There was no damage to the oven just the box.\n ", "\n  Touch pads seem a little harder to use than they need to be and double doors seem to slam closed too easily...they must be fully open or fully closed, which is a bit inconvenient to call it easy-to-use. Otherwise, it is a nice oven/toaster to augment my built in oven. Good for everyday use at a fair price.\n \n  I knew that I was buying this item as used. But that was not the case . The oven has never been used. It\u2019s just disfigured! And I thought at first that it was just a ding on top , which would have been fine, really. But the separation on the side was a different situation. Almost lost a finger it\u2019s so sharp! And now they want me to pay for return it !\n \n  This is a great product that performs as advertised. Unfortunately, we simply didn't grasp just how much space this counter top oven actually requires. We gave this as a gift - and it would have been perfect - but the recipients' counter space was simply too small for such a large oven.\n \n  It\u2019s great for the price and very big, I can do a full size meal in it. It saves me from turning on the gas oven, I pay much more in propane gas than electricity so this is perfect for us.\n \n  I only have one oven in my stove, and this one can be used to cook something else needed for the meal I am preparing.  It has actually become my go-to oven for anything quick to heat up, or for a meal to be cooked. \n  This is a great product, so far, I have only had it a short time but it has come in handy for many of the things I would use the oven in my stove to make. I love the French doors they are a very nice addition. The unit is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but with a little rearranging I am sure it will make a great addition to your kitchen.\n \n  In absolutely love this. I rent a room while in college and don\u2019t want to be bothered with roommates and and kitchen cleanliness. \n  This is a great oven, however, the outside gets very hot and is not counter safe if children are around.\n \n  On a previous review someone mentioned how long it takes to cook something. Maaan, this thing put me so far behind! As far as toaster ovens go, it's cool. But WHATEVER you are cooking add up to 45 minutes more cook time.\n \n  The doors get extremely hot, they are spring loaded and easily slam close on your arms as you\u2019re removing hot food items. ", "\n  Looked a little flimsy for an oven of that price range.\n \n  Thermostat not work....it's ok...not very good...\n \n  Cooks better than my oven most of the time because it has excellent quality and value, would recommend to others!!\n \n  The elements don't glow when it grills so you don't know if it is hot. We found that a little disconcerting, but it's great for cooking pizza and roasted vegetable because you can watch it cooking.\n \n  My wife loves the double doors, easy to clean, very professional\n \n  What a great little oven. This was a great purchase. I wish it would have come with more information on cooking tips. It didn\u2019t include a cooking or recipe guide which makes it a little difficult to use.\n \n  Did not like when toasting there is no timer, only number selection. I did like the way it toast things.( very evenly). I love that there\u2019s an internal light to see how things are going. I love the wide access with the French doors and beautiful design.\n \n  It seems to have a malfunction with the \u201cpreheat\u201d feature. It takes FOREVER to preheat, then it simply turns off when it\u2019s finished. Also the doors are a pain in the ass.\n \n  Works great. My oven broke and have been using this until we get a new one. My only complaint is that the outside gets pretty hot, so you need to be careful.\n \n  Works great. A little tricky to figure out the amount of time and temp to use compared to a regular oven. However, it's huge, clean, and the French doors are really nice. Leave room on the counter to open them.\n ", "\n  Love my convection oven, easy to use. I use it more than my regular oven. Nice to have a second oven. \n  i just buy it its not good ,im gonna return it its effected\n \n  I haven\u2019t used my oven since I got this. Love it! Having a timer keeps me from burning up my food. \n  We like this large countertop toaster oven. It toasts and cooks evenly and the temperature control seems accurate.  My only concern, which I guess is to be expected, is that the top gets extremely hot and you must be very careful not to touch it.\n \n  This oven works perfectly for us\n \n  This is a great oven. It cooks evenly and is far better than the toaster ovens I have owned previously. It is roomy and the french doors allow easy access. Buy one.\n \n  No too happy with the broil mode, it takes too long to cook. I have to use a booster to get the meat closer to the heating element.\n \n  i bought this in aug 2016  .and i loved it  the best toaster/convection oven i have ever owned  i love oster products and have almost exclusively \n  Great toaster oven.  The French doors make I easy to get larger items in and out. \n  works great so far I've cooked chicken in it and bacon and hot dogs and steaks and pork chops and easy to use temperatures right on the money lightweight\n ", "\n  We use this for everything now.  Enchiladas, biscotti, tri tip.  It does everything a built in oven can do.\n \n  Using this oven to cook for 2/3 people is a lot easier than the regular large oven. Easy to keep clean. I wish that when you open doors that the light goes on when it\u2019s off.\n \n  I like the size and the options, however, for the cost and a bit more searching I could have spent less for oven for the same features.\n \n  Seriously, it is a bit on the big side and the doors only stay open if they are opened all the way, but it works amazingly well. It\u2019s the most attractive toaster oven I have ever owned. Buy it\n \n  Our main oven stopped working and we needed to get something that worked like an oven and the Oster French door \n  Great for our outdoor kitchen under the pavilion.  Thanks...\n \n  Easy to use, works great and has large capacity. Takes a while to pre heat.\n \n  This over seemed perfect for what I needed but was a different color that I thought I selected..\n \n  It\u2019s big and works great. Just what we wanted\n \n  Had this oven for over a year, works great.\n ", "\n  This was a great purchase. I have broiled steaks,baked pizza everything has turned out delicious.\n \n  Live it bought for cabin. Great for pizza, I\u2019ve brought frozen. Casseroles and baked cookies\n \n  My oven sits in my kitchen unused for over a year.  The doors are still taped shut.  I will not use it because it contains a non-stick coating that was not revealed until too late.  It was listed as stainless.  Waste of money and space.  Anyone want to buy it cheap?\n \n  The preheat feature is great\n \n  Work well looks great\n \n  So easy to use and clean. Works perfect\n \n  Extremely satisfied\n \n  Love this oven\n \n  i like it.\n \n  Muy Bueno\n None ", "\n  Perfect\n \n  I love this!  We use it alot! Great size for baking sheets.\n \n  A loud pop after the cooking has completed\n \n  Aun me estoy adaptando a el sobre todo para recetas de pan\n None \n  Cheap\n \n  Poor quality\n \n  I have had this producted for a while now and its amazing. Baking, cooking, toasting bread and more it does it all abd pizza seting is great its so great i cant stop usibg it and super easy to clean. worth buying\n \n  Satisfied\n \n  Work great\n \n  Amazing, I actually only bought it for an extra oven for xmas and continue to use daily now.\n ", "\n  Best buy ever. I strongly recommend it.\n \n  Good size, works perfect\n \n  I originally bought this because I wanted to replace my old, out of date toaster oven and try out convection baking. I was not expecting that this would completely replace my toaster AND my oven. Everytime I use it I feel like I'm on the Baking Championship. It is large but you can fit almost every single thing that you would bake in an oven in this oven except for maybe a large turkey. It is so fun to use and it looks so professional on the counter, as well. I have baked everything from cookies to pizza to dinner all inside this oven. It does get uncomfortably hot on top, but only if you touch it. The sides don't get hot and they do have vents. The front have a small opening in between the doors but this does not affect the door handles as they stay cool to the touch throughout the entire baking process. One thing you have to remember is to open the doors all the way or they will swing back shut on the spring. My favorite part of this oven is that the front doors are glass and completely clear and the light comes on while it is baking so you can see everything that's going on inside the oven reducing your chance of burning dinner.\n \n  We really like that you can bake a pizza in it!  It worked correctly once we unpacked & plugged it in, unlike others we tried!\n \n  I cooks good\n \n  Best product I ever bought!\n \n  Great appliance, Intuitive controls, large oven, good quality.\n \n  I love my new oven.\n \n  I got what I wanted I am happy\n \n  Good\n ", "\n  The presets, french doors, and spaciousness of this oven exceeded our expectations. We can now cook 16\" pizzas! Worth your hard-earned bucks.\n \n  Awesome table top oven. Love the double doors! So much space inside, able to roast a 17 lb turkey!\n \n  Love this oven. Not sure last time I turned my large stove oven on.\n \n  Great product for a great price.\n \n  This is a lovely looking oven but it has problems. Biggest is you should be aware that the glass doors get REALLY hot and if your hand should touch them you'll get burned. Also the doors swing open wider than the width of the oven, and if you don't fully extend them they shut on your and my arm got burned when they did. Had to but Silicone gloves that extended beyond my wrists to protect my arms. Also the buttons aren't very sensitive to the touch. You really need to press and hold them. So far it seems to cook well enough and cleaning is easy. The big interior capacity is really nice. So i guess if you get gloves that cover your wrist and are heat resistant to 450+ degrees, and deal with the button problem, this is a handsome addition to your kitchen.\n \n  Didn\u2019t,t like having to mess with temp control after preheat of oven\n \n  My wife is truly in love with this oven. \n  Makes the best pizza. I use it mor than my oven.\n \n  Awaiting return label as I was told. \n  I purchased this oven mainly for the convection feature, however I am very surprised how well all the other features also function. other reviewers commented on the radiating heat, I found that it was not much more than our smaller toaster oven. I have cooked casseroles to football snacks in it and I just keep loving it more and more everyday and it has become my goto oven for anything that doesn't require a full-size oven. lastly it looks great in my kitchen\n ", "\n  Gift for grand daughter &she loves it,\n \n  \u26d4 LAST UPDATE FEBRUARY 22, 2017 \u26d4 \n  This oven is just wonderful.  My food comes out beautiful!!.  I bake two loaves of bread at once, and they come \n  i've had this oven less than 2 weeks..haven't used it too much, but it seems to cook ok, like veggie burgers...it heats up things fine...i've been wanting to call the company about this: i don't think you can set the temp. on the \"warm\" setting, i think it may be just one standard temp. on that particular setting...Also, i want to find out what kind of light bulb it takes, for when it burns out, and if there is any way to turn off the light when things are cooking...it seems like the bulb will burn out much faster being on all the time while using the oven...but one could look at that as a safety feature...come to think of it, that may be a key reason that it doesn't turn off...however, having the light on is nice and pleasant...There seems to be a small gap inbetween the doors, maybe 1/4\"...i'm not sure if mine is defective, or if all of them are that way...seems like it lets heat out, for whatever reason...not sure if it's a safety feature, if it gets too hot in there, or if mine is defective...For a convection oven, it looks like one of the better ones as far as aesthetics, that is if you like stainless steal...i always want everything to be a work of art, instead of the run of the mill way things look...so, this doesn't fit a work of art, but still one of the better looking ovens...Also, i'm not crazy at how both doors slam shut, if not completely wide open...i don't know why they made it that way...anyway, i'll update if i can add anything else, in the future...\n \n  *Update*12/01/16: I've recently baked a brownie cake, a fruit pie, pork belly and a big spiral sliced ham in this toaster oven and they all turned out wonderful. The spiral sliced ham was a hit since it was a dish for our Thanksgiving get together, was so juicy and tender, not dry at all and there were so many compliments. We also baked a big slice of pork belly for two hours, the top was so crispy and bubbly brown while the pork meat was tender and juicy just like the ham, I wasn't expecting that so I was amazed. Still very happy with my purchase! \n  Doesn\u2019t keep proper time, heat escapes out of the unsealed front doors...not sure how this received such good reviews.\n \n  Doesnt reach 400 degrees,timer starts when you turn on,not after set temperature is reached.\n \n  I love this toaster oven! I've no issues with the doors as some others have mentioned. In fact, I've no issues at all. The oven appears well made and probably the largest I've seen short of a commercial counter top version but those are very expensive. Heats very fast, pre-heat gives a tone to alert you the oven is ready, convection works marvelously and owners manual will help you to use it to fullest potential.\n \n  I love this convection toaster oven!  It fits two standard size frozen pizza's and pre-hears very quickly. It also has a really bright light inside the oven which stays on while the oven is in use, so it's easy to monitor your food while it's cooking. I love the timed WARM feature which I use to warm up my cold leftover pizza. It has several auto cook settings. \n  love it dose more than expected\n ", "\n  This is a really nice convection/toaster oven...probably the best I've ever had.  It is big, so if you have a small space, it is probably not for you.  Very roomy, pizzas fit inside with plenty of room.  Cooks evenly and faster than your regular oven.  I really like the interior light that comes on when you start the oven, turns off when done.  I also like the French doors...easier access to your pans, trays etc.  Highly recommend.\n \n  Anticipating a kitchen remodel, that's a long story, but utilize my oven a lot for cooking.  Not a baker, so I cannot comment on that.  I've been using it for over a week and totally love it.  The french doors are a perfect design feature.  Having read all the previous reviews I would concur as far as looks.  I didn't find the buttons hard to use, as some people previously commented.  This is a great item.  3/1/16 I've now baked a cheese cake in it and it was great.\n \n  One of the best countertop convection ovens I have found, works wonderfully, and the French doors give amazing large full access to the interior. Love it!!!\n \n  Love this oven. Cooked my bone-in turkey breast in this and it was terrific- moist, juice and beautifully browned. Use it more than my full size oven\n \n  Excellent convection oven. It cooks evenly and is very easy to use (similar to a microwave). The french doors are very unique and I have been very satisfied with the performance of this oven. Highly recommend.\n \n  Love this oven!!! I can use larger sized casserole dishes, 16 inch pizza pan with room to spare!! Lots of options and the French doors are so handy!! Don't hesitate to buy this oven!! You won't regret it!!\n \n  I love my counter-top oven.  I did spend alot of time researching and what not, I think I made a good choice ;-)\n \n  I'm very satisfied. I've had the oven for about 2 months and use it every day. It does everything it says it would do and I have not had any problems. I purchased it because my regular over takes forever to heat up and uses twice as much energy. This oven warms up in 10 minutes tops and even cooks quicker than my regular over, which was a very high end and expensive oven. All of my expectations were met with this oven and would not hesitate to recommend it.\n \n  Have been using it for 2 months and really love this oven. Remodeled house and didn't add an oven. This oven does all I need.\n \n  love this oven never have to used my big oven\n ", "\n  Very cheaply made slightly dented when received.\n \n  Without a doubt, my favorite item in the kitchen.  Love the larger size.  It is so versatile.  Would highly recommend\n \n  Returned only because it's very big. Would love a smaller version. The French door were very nice\n \n  This oven is amazing. It has replaced the big oven for a lot of food items. Fits a frozen pizza easily. I wish the buttons made a noise or a click when you pressed them, though. Other than that, we love it!\n \n  Perfect addition to our bar.\n \n  Love this oven.  Great size, great look.\n \n  Button are indeed hard to press. But I love the size.\n \n  Love it! Used every day since it arrived.\n \n  So many options -- including dehydrate.  Bright light to monitor cooking progress. Best counter oven ever.\n \n  This was a gift for our daughter. It was delivered on Monday, and she LOVES it!! Personally, I was impressed with the XL size and the French doors were a must have! The only \"glitch\" has been 2 were delivered instead of one-and only charged for one! Not a bad deal (lol)! But seriously, there has been no hassle at all. Return label is being sent, and a quick call to UPS gets the package picked up at my daughter's house at a time good for her. No complaints at all- fantastic product and company to work with!!\n ", "\n  I love this oven..big and beautiful....\n \n  Oster made another nice another nice product. A nice change from the old one door conventional ovens.\n \n  Excellent! Bakes thorough and precisely as described!\n \n  Very good very happy\n \n  I needed a replacement for my old toaster oven and decided to upgrade to a larger model. I wasn't sure I would like the digital pad but it is easy to use and I only had to refer to the instructions a couple of times.  The French doors are great, they stay open if you pull them all the way out and the one-handed design is so handy.  I love that I can cook larger items and not have to heat up my big oven when summer gets here.  I'm very happy with the browning and cooking of this oven.  It does take a little more room on the counter but it is well worth it.\n \n  love this toaster oven couldn't get it from anyone but you/\n \n  The doors slam shut if you are not holding open as you are trying to put items in it. Everyone in my house has told me they hate the new oven. I have burned my arm 3x,. Doesn't get hotter than 450. Not Recommended, wish i had the box so i could send it back.\n \n  So far this appliance is working out well. However, it's early in the game, hence the four stars, as it is still less than two months old and was bought to replace the non-digital model of this oven and whose timer stopped working within six weeks, causing a very distinct fire hazard. \n  I PURCHASED THIS DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON, SHOULD BE MARKED VERIFIED PURCHSE. \n  beautiful with my contemporary kitchen.love love\n ", "\n  Was somewhat disappointed with the unit and it's interface. \n  Good oven\n \n  wife very happy now\n \n  I have had this almost a week now and so far I'm pretty satisfied. It is very easy to use. So much so that my teenagers love it. We haven't used our regular oven since we got it. I gave it only four stars for a couple reasons. My main reason for getting it is because I bake a lot and wanted the convection option. When baking with convection things are suppose to cook more evenly. Not so much with this oven. Also the temperature is a bit off and there is a gap between where the doors meet and it lets the heat escape. This is still the best toaster oven I've ever had and I like thee extra large size. With that said make sure you have counter space to spare or a cart.\n \n  My last little Oster oven finally died and so the hunt began for a new one.  I love the French doors on this oven. The only thing is they're on a spring, so one must be careful.  It keeps the temp & time accurately.  Everything I've cooked has come out perfect.\n \n  I have just received the Oster TSSTTVRDDG - French Door Countertop Oven one hour ago (Wed. Jan 7, 2015). \n  This is not a toaster oven unless you like your toast like dry bread.  The oven is just so so, I am very disappointed.  The only thing it does well is look good on my counter.\n \n  Happy so far with this purchase.  Love the French Doors.  Received my order super fast. Great price.\n \n  takes forever to cook or toast\n \n  This oven works fine and is super quiet in turbo fan assisted  but this is I do not like about it. ", "\n  it doesn't work! thankfully I bought the insurance, see if this works....\n \n  This is not a very good choice. The French doors are scary, they do not \u201clock\u201d open, and they can easily close on your hands when hot, like when you are turning food over. They are also spring loaded to close, DUH, STUPID DESIGN. Next on the stupid list is the control panel where you have to crouch down to operate it. Why? Because you can\u2019t see the clock in daylight to set it and The panel itself has non tactile buttons, making it even more difficult. I tried it once and returned it, thought it was dangerous and went back to using my old one.\n \n  I love this oven. I didn't purchase my oven from Amazon, my sister bought it for me. I actually had two different models already. But this Oven is fantastic. Not only because of the size. Which it is much larger than the typical Toaster oven. Measuring pretty close to 16\"x15\" in the Interior. But the features. An Interior light that stays on while cooking. A Turbo Convection Bake Mode. Which not only speeds up cooking, but helps cook more evenly. My first dish was a Corn Souffle. Not only did it cook it in less time, it cooked the dish more evenly than my oven, and browned it to perfection. I took frozen Corn Dogs and placed them in the oven, again using Turbo mode. The instructions for baking stated approx. 15-17 minutes at 350 degrees. In 12 Minutes they were ready and they had the crust of fried Carnival Corn dogs. This Oven will Defrost, Dehydrate, Bake, Broil. Toast and even has a separate control just for Pizza. And it's definitely large enough to accommodate one. The French doors swing out easily and stay open just by pulling one of the two handles. And although I read a comment by one reviewer that stated the handles were a problem, I would disagree. I think the handle design is a PLUS. And for the size of this oven a MUST. Everything I have cooked in this oven has turned out perfectly. And I would add my 84 year old mother has one too. She cooks everything in hers. She doesn't even use her regular in home oven anymore. So if you are on the fence about this oven by Oster, it is well worth the money. Make someone happy.. give them one of these..\n \n  Pretty?  Yep.  Effective...it does work.  Well made and meet the specs it says?  Nope.  The two french doors have a 1/16\" gap between them when closed which allows heat to escape.  The broil setting is for 450F.  I was broiling sausage for lunch and had to do it for 16 minutes instead of the 10 it would have taken on my old, now dead 10 year old Breville equivilent.  I put after 5 minutes an oven digital accurate thermometer in directly under the elements to be broiled just like the sausage...most I got was 291F on the reading after five minutes.  Everything takes longer and it simply is not as efficient.  Bigger and gorgeous but not in the same league as Breville's unit.  I'll keep it rather than invest more in a new Breville but in retrospect, I should have stayed with Breville.\n \n  I\u2019ve had this lovely toaster oven for over 3 months now.  Here\u2019s the thing:  those adorable French doors?  They will not stay open when you need to get hot items out.  Either you hold one door open with one hand, or you use the back of your arm and get burnt.  My son and husband now have matching burn scars from the cute French doors.  This is a serious and dangerous design flaw. \n  Not sure how this got such good reviews, but it does bake extra large pizzas (sort of) it does have convection sort of. It does OK. But not 5 star OK. It takes a few minutes to cook toast and I still cant figure out how to set the timer for toast? (Maybe that is on me) The large Pizza capacity is nice, but half way through the cooking cycle you better turn your pizza around. Because it cooks nicely in the back, but the barn doors have gaps that let in cold air, so the front doesnt cook as well. (Uneven cooking) It also has convection, but it must be the worlds smallest fan compared to other convection ovens Ive had. there is air movement, but not like you might get with other ovens, or especially an air fryer. On a good note, your bacon wont go flying around in the oven. Over all its OK and does the job and if you need a bigger toaster oven this is probably it. The barn doors look cool, but also let in air with no seal what so ever like you might find on any other oven door. LOL Also if you accidentally bump the barn doors while open, there is a chance that might slam on your arm and those 350 degree doors can be pretty hot. Another design flaw that is not always an issue, but is a risk when your working with limited counter space and might bump the doors while wide open. Im still not sure why I cant set the time for the toast function, for some reason the timer while on toast just changes the heat setting. I might be doing something wrong there, as that really would be a design flaw. A toaster oven that doesnt toast right.\n \n  I have had this convection toaster oven for nearly 2 years and, even though it\u2019s quite large I was growing quite fond of it. My chief criticism was that the buttons were not easily pushed. It took quite an effort to select your cooking preference. As you can see from this picture I have pushed the stop button for the last time. It\u2019s not worth repairing. I am going to junk it and look for another toaster oven. Such a shame. Another criticism was that it took an eternity for it to make toast, even at the darkest setting and with the rack directly under the  elements. Oh well.\n \n  Its a 5-star machine, I use it daily for all baking/cooking needs.  I have found 2 things wrong, the electrical cord is too short and the bake pan with sides has discolored and looks bad with constant use. The flat cookie sheet is flimsy so it now has a buckle.  With that said. I'd buy again, its a great workhorse of a machine, I love the french doors, I love to bake and I use this machine exclusively except during Thanksgiving.\n \n  This is my first of this type. I've always wanted one and am glad I ordered it. It is stainless steel in design so it should fit any decor. It has to baking racks and two trays at the bottom. I have not cooked a pizza in this oven as of yet, however, we've cooked things like burritos and corn dogs and I'll tell you, it beats turning on the oven and heating up the oven. It has a clock on it as well as a timer and temperature controls.If gives you bake, broil, toast, turbo convection, pizza, warm, defrost and dehydrate settings. The oven preheats prior to cooking. If you turn off the oven in the middle of cooking, pushing once will pause, but not stop the cooking process. You will need to push it twice. I like this in the case of accidentally shutting this off, which I have done, because I keep confusing it with the microwave. \n  Beautiful appliance, yes but...It's good for toasting and baking foods but not baked goods. I keep home made baked goods in the  freezer and we bake them as we need them. I purchased this because I didn't want to heat up the whole house using my oven for 3 cookies. It doesn't work--cooking is uneven; outside is burnt and inside is raw. I've tried cornbread, bagels, and other baked goods with same result. It does work nicely for things like scalloped potatoes, jam, casseroles, etc., but it's not worth taking up so much counter space. I'll just use my full-size convection oven and buy a small old school toaster oven to...well, toast!!!\n ", "\n  When introduced it had three knobs on front and not touch control.  Later came the touch screen and I had to have one. I ordered copper. First one did not work at all. Sent back, new one came. Touch screen requires a very heavy push to work. I set the clock, runs crazy, time is way off.  I love the way it cooks, but given a choice I would definitely but the mechanical model with 3 control knobs. Great oven, awful control panel.\n \n  We just got this for Christmas (1 week ago) and everything works great so far.  We got the idea to make jerky and after some playing around with it, I found how it can be done.  You want to use the Warm setting for 90 minutes to start with.  When the Warm setting is used on long time periods is uses a temperature of 140 degrees until the last 20 minutes then it increases to 200 degrees, so I was able to use Warm for 90 minutes, then another 20 minutes which set the temperature to 200 degrees the whole time which was good to dry out the jerky to the ideal level.  It would be nice if the convection oven setting could go down to 160 degrees because the air circulation is ideal for drying out the meat but it bottom's out at 200, I tried to open the lid a little but the oven compensates and continues to eat above 200 to that just isn't want you want, therefore I would stick with the Warm setting.  Having a meat thermometer really helps.  Jerky came out great!  I used a Dr. Pepper recipe I found on the Net.  It would be nice if they can add a dehydration setting in their next model, it can't be that hard from what already have.\n \n  I use this oven everyday it\u2019s way too hot where I live to cook inside it\u2019s very handy! There\u2019s just a huge problem with the doors they slam closed and have almost burned me several times. It finally got me and burned me so bad the door got stuck to my arm and pulled off my skin. It\u2019s a major manufacturer defect and needs to be recalled and fixed.\n \n  I really wanted to like this, but I've used it 3 times and burned myself all 3 times. Everything except the handles are extremely hot. When you go to open the door holding the handle, if you accidentally touch the glass or any other part of the door, you will get severely burned. And sometimes you think you got the door all the way open, but you don't so you go to touch the door to close it and it's extremely hot! And this does give off a ton of heat... almost more so than an oven. I'm in Arizona so I try to avoid heating up the kitchen in the summer which is a huge reason I got this. This is going back, and I'm going back to my De'Longhi toaster oven for now. Hopefully I'll find something similar to this with a cooler exterior cause it does look gorgeous in the kitchen.\n \n  I bought the manual control version, which other than the knobs, is exactly the same as this one. \n  I like the modern design I like the light that is inside  And it is quiet not a sound comes from this machine.  I don't like the spaces between the 2 doors and the perimeter of the doors on both sides where the light and the heat  excape from the inside of the oven thus, less heat remains inside of the oven to cook the food and, it takes longer because of the cracks and openings on the sides of the door and between the 2 doors, heating up entire kitchen.\n \n  We ordered this toaster oven for a test kitchen at our facility, and it is perfect for the space.  The double doors allow for larger roasting pans, and the automatic timer is effective once you get used to us (it appears to auto-set for 30 minutes once the toaster oven finishes preheating).  So far we have made spicy buffalo cauliflower bites and mini cheese and onion quiches in the oven, both of which turned out spectacularly- the same as a full sized oven.  We lowered the temperature by 25 degree F for both recipes, which was a good idea as I think they may have burned otherwise.  Overall great quality toaster oven, looks really nice, and functions like a full sized oven.  We are very happy with our purchase.\n \n  Love, love, love my Oster! I got it to replace a smaller convection/toaster oven that I had for about 10 years. I've had this one for two years now and it still works wonderfully.  I always use the convection bake and it doesn't disappoint or get too loud. We have a family of four and I can make all kinds of desserts, breads, and casseroles in it. It gets used more frequently than my regular gas oven. It fits perfectly on the corner beside my stove to allow for door swing.\n \n  I've been looking for ages for a countertop convection oven that holds a 9 x 13 pan. This unit is the only one that does so, in my experience. I have some favorite stoneware pans with handles, and they fit in this oven, back to front (in the curved back for a 16-inch pizza). Just barely, but the doors shut. A major advantage. And for slightly smaller pans, it works great. \n  Did not cook with it.  Pluged it in and the clock gained over four hours in a twenty four hour day. In a timed receipe , this could be a problem. We are returning it  with its replacement on its way. I can not believe we are the only one with this problem.\n ", "\n  Sorry but some of these reviews are NOT for French door version....we are considering buying, check reviews only to see some that make claims that regard other single door versions.\n \n  Super gorgeous and truly doubles as a second oven that can travel in a trunk of a car to vacations that do not provide a full kitchen or as a add on oven at home when cooking for a large family. Works like a dream. The only drawback-- it is not flat in the back. it has half a sphere shape sticking in the back. It makes the cooking larger items possible but makes it very difficult to operate in a small apartment or house-- no counter space to accommodate it. It has to be placed at least six inches away from anything on all sides; the curved back more than doubles that distance. However, if the placement issue can be solved; it is a beautiful and well functioning piece.\n \n  This oven by far exceeds my previous model. It bakes, toast, cooks everything just fine. I absolutely love the French doors. This is just a nice toaster oven. Oster has done good with this model.\n \n  Just received yesterday from QVC ... I'm a loyal Amazon buyer but this no longer sold via Amazon and got for $129.95 in 5 easy payments. Anyhow iI realized if you move crumb tray into rack slots it will function as a wonderful cookie sheet! QUESTION - Can regular or convection oven temp settings be used without timer? I'm thinking of slow cooking - dehydrate allows 6 hours but 150 degrees too low for slow cook... Overall so far I'm so thrilled with the oven. Aside from gorgeous the French doors are convenient and the only other oven with this 1.5 cubic foot capacity is the Breville Air Pro at $388! So don't hesitate this oven is an amazing buy msrp $199.99 or so.\n \n  When you don't want to warm up your regular oven for the frozen pizza but the frozen pizza won't fit in a toaster oven ... this appliance is great. \n  First of all, I have never used a convention oven but always wanted to try one. \n  Beautiful addition to my kitchen. I must preface this that this is replacing another Oster oven I have had for about 2 years that is a tad larger. I will probably miss that I won't be able to cook the same size roasting chickens, etc, in this. But overall I am thrilled. I absolutely love the French doors. My old one had a door which opened down and could occasionally burn me if I wasn't careful putting food in or even simply closing it again. The French doors work in tandem and close flawlessly. I also think this unit is more energy efficient as well as my kitchen doesn't seem to warm up the way it did when I had my old counter top Oster going. No complaints, beautifully modern and looks wonderful on my countertop!\n \n  Wish it would of came with a cookbook.\n \n  This is a great counter-top oven that you can cook almost anything you want to in. My only complaints are in its structural design. It functions great! \n  Touch Buttons do not work for me, but work for my wife. Called service number they had NO ANSWER. Now who do I call???\n ", "\n  I just got mine and immediately started creating fun meals to test it out. The controls are simple, intuitive and the buttons are responsive. The oven itself is beautiful and gives my kitchen an elegant look. \n  Our ancient toaster oven was serving us well, but when this monster came up on Vine, we decided to try a new one. When the package arrived, we were shocked at the size of the box. It was huge. Then, we had to find a place for it on the counter. It took up 50% more geography than the old one. A factor I failed to check before ordering so please get your tape measure out before ordering. \n  As a straight up toaster/convection oven, the Oster French Door has the potential to do a decent job.  If you need exact temperatures, the item I received is not calibrated correctly. I chose it to review mainly to use as an extra food dehydrator but unless you are only making jerky, this will cook your food as opposed to just drying it out. The minimum temperature is 150 degrees so using it for raw food is out of the question as anything over 90 degrees is considered cooking. Fruits, nuts, herbs, and vegetables dehydrate between 95 and 135 degrees, often for 24 hours or longer. The timer on this goes for 9 hours, then you must reset. Using the above and considering this unit runs 6 degrees higher via my very accurate CDN thermometer, you must adjust temps and times if this is the norm and not just a fluke with mine. \n  love it. Do not use my oven anymore. Large enough to make a big pizza and everything else.  Love, love love!\n \n  My French doors DO stay open. I got mine through another vendor. It's incredible and fun to use, perfect outcomes. Love it.\n "]}, "/Luby-GH55-H-Toaster-Oven-White/product-review/B07DR5QRY8/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=oven&qid=1597683407&sr=8-5": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["\u3010Large countertop oven\u3011 Enough for baking a 14-inch pizza, roasting a 20-lb turkey, a family cake or a nice tenderloin and comfortably fit 24 cup muffin trays.

After burning ourselves numerous times, having a drop-down door eat up available counter space and constantly fighting with getting the a tray or casserole dish out of our Waring Pro WTO450 it was time for a change. We figured if there was lost counter space it might as well be for a bigger oven than a drop down door that was bothersome. The capacity in this oven is enormous compared to a standard size toaster oven and with the added capacity we can do more with it and less with our electric range\u2026 which literally just burned through another heating element. We didn\u2019t want convection, a drop down door, an electronic touchpad or to pay anywhere near 200-bucks so it was a limited field and this one fit our search criteria. It was a somewhat reluctant purchase and an Oster with convection heating was the alternative but we\u2019re at a high altitude so convection wasn\u2019t really needed and that left few choices with French doors and non-convection. This is a counter hog but since the doors swing open it\u2019s a minor issue but my major issue is that the timer must be on for it to operate even though the pic showed a timer dial with a \u201cStay on\u201d setting that ours doesn\u2019t have so a loud timer must be on to use it and if the timer fails the oven is non-operational. I\u2019ll likely install an on/off toggle switch to bypass the timer because I doubt returning it for this reason would result in a replacement with the timer feature I thought I was getting. The major pluses, for us anyway, is that the doors open out (and we can open just one at a time) and the upper & lower elements have their own temperature settings\u2026 or you can just use whichever one you prefer. The handle for the grill and pan is a nice touch so we no longer have to reach into the over to grab something while using bulky mitts and then fighting to get it out like we did with the Waring\u2026 which taxed our patience and that led to burns. For its size, it\u2019s rather lightweight and we tried it on our island with a Formica countertop but it slid so easily I could see dinner going off the side and onto the floor with just a small push. I\u2019m building a small stand to place it on to have some counter space underneath and will add some rubber feet to keep it in place. It\u2019s hard to please everyone with a single appliance but this was relatively inexpensive compared to most of the alternatives and ours has a removable sheet on the bottom that collects crumbs so I\u2019m calling it a crumb tray. The dials are hard to read since the pointer is just an arrow that\u2019s the same color as the dial face. As usual, instructions are vague or nebulous (like put the rack in the center position when there\u2019s only 4-options so there\u2019s not one that\u2019s in the center) and it\u2019s not mentioned if it\u2019s best to bake with both the upper & lower elements on for a more consistent bake. It also doesn\u2019t heat/bake evenly but that\u2019s the same with our stove oven but the pre-heat time is much quicker. It gets too hot to place your hand on the top but the sides aren\u2019t too bad and it\u2019s pretty much the same thing with most other countertop ovens/toasters we\u2019ve had previously. At 400-degress ours showed 375-degress on two different oven thermometers but that\u2019s close enough and since the doors have a gap in the middle and don\u2019t seal tightly they are likely like that so the glass doesn\u2019t overheat. It\u2019s really not a good toaster though it\u2019ll get the job done but it takes a long time to heat up to the point that it\u2019s actually toasting something. My biggest peeve is that the timer dial controls the on/off process and it really should have been incorporated into the dials for the elements since it\u2019s lacking the \u201cStay on\u201d feature. Once this is on a counter there\u2019s very little room left in front of it and what is left is pretty much unusable. The doors do stay open but the handles are not even with each other. Though there\u2019s nothing that says \u201cbroil\u201d on it that can be accomplished by using just the upper elements; and ours has a crumb tray (I\u2019m still not sure what all those no crumb tray reviews meant\u2026 were they expecting a separate tray or missing the bottom inside plate) so that cuts down a lot of unfavorable reviews. I don\u2019t \u201cLove it\u201d but I\u2019ll stay with 5-stars despite my issues with the timer functioning as the on/off switch. We\u2019ve done bread, toast, bagels, English muffins and a fruit pie in it, so far, and no complaints with the finished products. \n  This toaster oven is HUGE!  I can cook an entire cookie sheet of food for my family at once.  I love that!  You could easily cook a small turkey in this thing.  It heats up quickly and so far has cooked everything evenly. \n  Overall a decent toaster with separate controls for both top and bottom elements, IF, that is what you are looking for and which I am not. I would rather have had the typical broil, toast, bake and CONVECTION dial that I was expecting since It said in many places that it IS convection. I just reallly hate misleading product description don't you ?\n \n  This toaster oven is fabulous!! I love how large it is and that there are two temperature controls for the two different levels. There is a timer built in which I love! The size is perfect for larger items or even just bagels or sandwiches. It heats up quickly and evenly. This would make a great gift or even to replace an old toaster oven!!\n \n  Very happy with this toaster  oven . Cooks food great timer runs a little fast but that is th only negative that i can say about it.\n \n  Came with no crumb tray.  Is NOT convection, no fan.  Outside got really hot and heated the room.\n \n  My Luby oven came today and I quickly got it out and baked a pizza! I love that the oven heated up quickly and was super easy to use! I\u2019m definitely excited to bake more yummy things and would highly recommend this oven!\n \n  I got this for my kitchen to replace what we thought was a large toaster oven, man this thing is BIG!!! It is a perfect size to cook pizzas in and does a phenomenal job at that.  Toaster oven really doesn't have good temp controls but if you can figure out the upper and lower settings it works great. We like it, it lives on the corner in our kitchen and we use it all the time now.\n \n  Oh wow! It's much bigger than I expected, but I'm good with that. The appearance was more stainless than white (as the description had mentioned) but that's fine, as stainless is more neutral. My first use of the oven was more trial and error than anything, but then it became easier to operate, until I was able to actually bake in it. I would most definitely recommend this oven to anyone who prefers quick and easy over heating up the actual large oven. I'm most certainly giving this product as many stars as I can, it's unfortunate 5 is the most.\n \n  Nice oven, but chalk up another no crumb tray.. after carefully reading every word however, it doesn't list a crumb tray. There is a picture in the book that shows a crumb tray, but the description clearly says bake tray, wire rack, handle and separate knob controls. No talk of a crumb tray. ", "\n  Did not come with a crumb tray. Doors don't open simultaneously. Certainly not a convection oven.  Temperature control is too difficult.  Instruction booklet is very inadequate.  No information about the company or customer support included.  No where near the quality I expect from the Amazon site!\n \n  It works insanely well! Bought it for my 9 y/o daughter for Christmas and she uses it all the time. Handles get a bit hot but I always have her use gloves to avoid that!\n \n  Excellent counter top oven. So far it has been very good. Large capacity, I've done a turkey in it, and accurate temperatures. The rack that comes with it is a little cheesy and the elements are exposed. Better racks and a plate or something covering the elements and its perfect! Would recommend and buy again.\n None None None \n  \u00a0I was able to broil meat and set the timer, it came out perfectly cooked and very tender. I also toasted a grilled cheese sandwich which was crispy on the outside,the kids loved it. The removable rack and tray are really easy to clean. This fits on my countertop and is a great alternative to the full-size oven, especially in the summertime.\n \n  This toaster oven does not disappoint.  It heats up quickly and evenly.  It\u2019s very easy to use and cleans up nicely.  I baked some cookies to test it out they cooked to perfection.\n \n  I loved the oven but the outside got so hot it was fire concern\n \n  The item was ordered on June 24, 2019 and has stopped working.  It did not last a month.  I am trying desperately to get in touch with someone that can help.  I am sure it is still in the initial warranty period.  Please help!\n \n  very happy with this oven lots of room  and fast shipping  good deal\n \n  Cheaply made, flimsy doors. When I received it in the mail the indicator light wasn\u2019t working and was missing one of the items listed .\n \n  A lot better than the one I had at home\n ", "\n  This oven LOOKS pretty, thats the only positive thing I can say. The temperature knob is HORRIBLE. You have to GUESS where 375 would be. When you open the door to insert a tray, all the heat escapes and your temperature plummets thereby affecting your cooking time etc. Another issue is that the temperature of 375 was nearly impossible to achieve. Using both top and bottom heating units at 375-ish (since you have to guess) would only get me to 300\u00b0. Putting the knob at about 400\u00b0 or maybe 410\u00b0 (again its a guess because theres no actual setting) this would only get me to 320\u00b0 ( I bought an oven thermometer). I achieved the temperature of 375\u00b0 when the knobs were at 450\u00b0 but ince I opened doors to QUICKLY insert cake pan, the temp. would plummet and take too long to return to temp. This brings me to ANOTHER issue, this oven takes about 40 minutes or so to heat up. I gave up and used my actual oven instead because other than its \"LOOKS\", THIS OVEN IS A NIGHTMARE!! RETURNING ASAP !\n \n  I bought this large model so I could fit my large Romertoph clay roasting pot inside.  It fits, 5 lb chicken, lid and all.  Best part of the deal is no mess inside the oven and we still get crispy chicken.  With the double doors, it\u2019s easy to get things in and out.  Seems to heat up very quickly and cook evenly.  Ours has a Stay On feature, also handy. \n  This baby will hold a Volkswagen. It looks high end and was a great price.  Arrived faster than promised by a month. \n  We have used this daily for the past 10 months while RVing during a house remodel. It arrived slightly dented in the back due to being dropped when it was shipped, but the small depression hasn't affected its operation.  If you prefer to a toaster oven for most things versus cranking up the big oven (or sticking your head in a very low, small propane oven to light a pilot light), you can adapt to this one well. Like most small ovens, the temperature dial is more of a \"guideline\" until you get to know your oven. And you can control the bottom and top heat separately. It is big. Really big. It is a small oven--not a \"toaster\"--which is what we wanted. The double doors make it easy to see when your pie crust and cookies are done. A pair of 9\" round layer cake pans need to be placed diagonally versus side-by-side. 13x9\" pyrex or 10\" round pie pans are no problem. The printed numbers on the timer/temp dials do rub off after time. (It was $75. I can deal.) The black indicator on the black dial is difficult to see. Two lines with a silver Sharpie can fix that.  (It was $75. I can deal.) We have a 50 amp service wired like a house. We have used it repeatedly at 450 degrees with no problems as long as we don't try to run anything else on the same circuit at the same time. The exterior of the oven gets very hot to the touch, just like \"toaster\" ovens. Put a ceramic coffee cup spacer (or glass cutting boards) between the oven and any walls. We haven't set ourselves on fire yet, but we don't dare leave any heated appliance unattended in an rv. (It was a steal at $75. We would buy it again.)\n \n  My oven arrived 2 days after ordering!  Wanted to say that right up front after reading so many reviews about lengthy delivery time.  Writing this during the Covid-19, 'Safer-At-Home' chaos during which many, many of us find ourselves cooking much more than we want to.  I'm a senior citizen and I'm trying to fix more meals at home for myself and my mother, who is nearly 90 and lives just a few blocks away.  I live in a rural area and my regular range/oven runs on propane.  To me it always seemed wasteful to heat up that big ole' oven to bake a few cookies or small meatloaf, etc., for myself so I had a toaster oven that I used often and, for the most part, worked well for most of my needs.  Now, cooking more often and for another person the toaster oven just wasn't cutting it and the regular oven still seemed overkill for meals for 2 old ladies. Started looking for larger, counter-top ovens on Amazon and came across this one by Luby.  Read many, many of the reviews and customer questions and decided this was something I could work with.  Could not be happier with my purchase so far!  It arrived yesterday. The first thing I did was un-pack it on the front porch, read the small booklet that came with, plugged it in on the porch outside and turned it on to the highest temp to run for about 20 minutes to burn off any manufacturer hooey on the components and leave the fumes outside.  After it cooled down I brought it in and baked a few canned biscuits and refrigerated cookie dough to put it through it's paces.  I need to work on how to combine the controls to get the most efficient temperature setting from top and bottom elements, but that's not a big deal to me.  I just hung a regular oven thermometer on the rack and it worked great. I loved being able to see right into the oven and not having to bend down to lift things in and out of a hot oven! \n  Love, love, love it! \n  Edit: three weeks in. HOLY CRAP this is fantastic. I've made homemade bread, pie, casseroles, cookies, biscuits... it's perfect. Temperature is accurate (unlike my useless wall oven that didn't work right even when it did work). The price was amazing. I got this as a temporary replacement for our broken oven, but I think I'll just keep this and save the $2000 (yes, wall ovens are that much!). Just buy it! \n  This arrived damaged. The box it came in was perfectly in tact. The corners were covered and protected by styrofoam which remained undamaged. When removed from the box and packaging, the back top corner has been dented in. This was packaged damage which only means there is poor quality control. Again, the packaging, box, styrofoam protection showed no damage/tears/breakage or any signs of being dropped. I bought this as a gift for my mom and she is telling me it might be fine if it works anyways. We will test it, I'm assuming the oven works fine. Just poor quality control for this product.\n \n  This oven/toster is amazing, I love it, it's so big for a countertop oven. This oven makes great toast and it even has its dedicated toaster timer, so it's quick and easy. This heats up very quickly so becare not to over cook, and watch the food. It even makes food like a normal oven, it has a temperature knob that tells the temperature, and a knob that can go to 60 Minutes. You can make so many things here like pizza, muffins, baked chicken, mac and cheese, ext. Like most oven, you should adjust the time and temperature if something burns. For me it burned my toast the first time, i slowly adjusted the time I put and they don't burn anymore. So no one should complain if you can adjust the temperature, and time when something burns, I see so many people complaining about that. Also please read the instructions.\n \n  I was really surprised of size of this oven. It is bigger than I thought, I end up moving up the shelf up to make space in the countertop. Really happy with everything so far after few weeks of usages. This oven bake our home-made pizza and cookies perfectly and quickly. We bought chicken wings from our local Jewel Osco all the time, this oven just make all the refrigeratored left over ", "\n  Asides from the conventional oven, I also have a toaster at home. The problem with these ovens is that they are either too big or too small. I have been looking for an oven with the size right in the middle so that I can cook stuff like the whole chickens without having to waste too much energy. This product is ideal for me in this sense. I have placed it in the garage, and it has worked for me very well. You can control the temperature using both the top and bottom knob. The timer works fine too. The lack of the stay-on button does not bother me, because I prefer to have the timer on at all time. Overall, this oven meets my expectations.\n \n  The toaster oven allows you to cook two things as you can set a temperature for the bottom rack and one for the top rack. My end product has never been overcooked or undercooked, so I can feed the food to my children without worrying. There is also enough room to cook basically anything like pizza and a pie so running out of room on the racks is not really a worry either.\n \n  I bought this oven for my baby cuz they wanna have some homemade strawberry cheesecake and homemade pizza. well when i received the oven it did surprise me with the large capacity, i can make the pizza and the cheesecakes at the same time. sometimes i can make the chicken wings for myself. it\u2019s very easy to operate just like the regular oven and very easy to clean. tips- before you use make sure you turn on the oven and let it operate about 15 mins, there\u2019s a safety net covering the oven and when you smell something like burning it is ok now you can use it.\n \n  Very hard to get to the correct temperature and stay at your desired temperature.  The gap between the glass door leaks tons of heat and there is no light inside the oven.  While the oven is big it is very hard to keep at temperature.  The timer /on-off know is very difficult to use and there is NO light to tell you when your oven does reach the correct temperature.\n \n  I gave this as a gift to my son to replace his old counter top oven. He loves it, uses it all the time and says that it cooks evenly, heats quickly, and has good temperature control. He likes the double doors as opposed to traditional style door on a counter top oven. The door handles can be a bit warm to touch but what works nicely are mini silicone oven mitts (like at https://www.amazon.com/Acronde-Mini-Oven-Gloves-Mitts/dp/B07MKP321M/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3O79QMVRAGNGK&keywords=fingertip+oven+mitts&qid=1579356684&sprefix=finger+tip+oven+mitts%2Caps%2C1036&sr=8-7). Overall, I would recommend this oven. As the product description indicates, the oven is larger with larger space to cook/heat foods.\n \n  My custom built-in oven went out just before Thanksgiving. Naturally I panicked and rushed to pull up Amazon to see about a toaster oven big enough to cook my Thanksgiving meal in.  I cooked my turkey in an electric roaster which I already had but everything else; dressing, various casseroles, pies etc. all in this toaster oven. It can hold 2 9x13 casseroles at a time and the temperature is accurate. I highly recommend this oven.\n \n  Cheap reproduction of a good  oven\n \n  This is a nice countertop oven that is well-made and larger than most. My only complaint is the temperature settings are way off -- by around 50\u00b0. I have 3 different thermometers inside to check temp. To get 350\u00b0 I need to set it to around 400\u00b0 and to get 400\u00b0 I need to set it on max at 450\u00b0 (so it never can get close to 450\u00b0 -- bad for cooking a pizza). The preheat temp also drops dramatically when you introduce the food to be cooked. Adding something like a casserole to a 350\u00b0 preheated oven drops the temp immediately to below 250\u00b0 and it takes several minutes to get back to 350\u00b0 so timing how long to cook something is a guess (but longer than a recipe calls for). If it weren't for these temperature problems I would rate it 5 stars but the that drops the rating down a lot. Also it should be noted that a small cookie sheet fits but a medium size one does not so making 2 dozen cookies is a challenge.\n \n  I needed something extra for baking in the kitchen because the one oven wasn't getting everything done at the same time.  I Found this to be the Perfect Solution, but not only as a back up - I've been using it almost every day as the main oven!  It is so perfect and big enough for every-day meals so I don't have to heat up the big oven.  It cooks so fast, COOLS very quickly, and it's wonderful for small items to bake so we really save on energy.  One of The Best Qualities is that I can control the top and bottom coils because they each have separate dials and it prevents burning.  I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT MY NEW OVEN AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!\n \n  Pros: i wanted the biggest toaster oven that I could find becuase when we use the oven, we really use it. SO this accomplished that, it has a very big interior area to cook food. ", "\n  Two coils is not enough for this \n  This toaster oven works very well!!!!  It is the perfect size, not huge but big enough to bake for the whole family or guest. \n  I\u2019m sending it back because it was damaged, so I never got to use it! I also paid 29.99 for a warranty that I can\u2019t use because I am getting my money back!\n \n  My wife used it almost every day for a week after the arrival of the goods. Every day, she said it was the most correct product I bought. This oven is really easy to use. It's not only big, but also has two layers in it. You can bake many different things at once, or a big turkey. What I eat most these days is cake. My wife said that the cake baked in this oven is very fragrant. Looking at her happy appearance, I am very satisfied. It's worth recommending, and the price is not expensive.\n \n  Got for Honorary Daughter and SIL next door 3 Kids house and car payment.Using a toaster oven when baby girl.My Grands told me no oven just toaster oven and portable eletric eye. \n  Works well so far, looks great. Functionally, would be nice to have more precise temperature control. \n  Just got it a week ago. Nice big unit for the price. great for garlic bread with topside power on high. Takes awhile to heat up. Separate upper and lower temperature controls and the price were my reasons for buying.  so far so good\n \n  I ended up returning it, I got it because of the large interior BUT it takes forever to heat up, took too as long to bake a cake I ended up buying the Nuwave bravo XL which I highly endorse,\n \n  Living in a rental home with an oven that smokes every time we use it has sucked so bad. This on the counter oven has been a god send! It looks so nice and is so big!! Seriously such a great find. It does get hotter at the back of the oven so, you sometimes have to rotate food. Honestly, not that big of a deal to me. I love this.\n \n  I have returned this oven due to it stopping heating. Had it about 2 months, used it about 15 and it stopped working. I also noticed that it is actually to big to support weight on the flimsy wire rack. It also draws a ton of power causing my breaker to flip if I had the oven on and anything else in the kitchen on. There are better discount ovens out there I repurchase the gourmia and it seems to be pretty good.\n ", "\n  It's a great oven and it's very big. It arrived yesterday and I immediately used it. It heats up very well and I was able to bake four 9\" round cakes at a time, the cakes were placed at angle in order to do so, but it worked! It's super easy to use and it's very easy to clean. I like that it comes with a removable handle to pull our the tray or rack. I do like it so far.\n \n  There is no way to get to the control knob on the upper heating element to get the dial to return to the OFF position. I turned it all the way to the left and the power light is still on, even though the upper heating element is turned off. Not getting accurate temp with control knob settings. \n  We are happy with this purchase! I have baked bread and roasted meat with good success ( also was a Chef for 20 years too). My only complaint is the doors don't seal well but frankly, it hasnt affected the performance much.  We pondered this items vs on that was almost $100 more- am glad we \"cheaped\" out.\n \n  After waiting a month and a half the crumb tray was missing from the box.  Not good!\n \n  Great size. The only issue is the cooking instructions I believe are way off! So I had a learning curve for seeing if you need both top and bottom heating elements or just top or just bottom once that was figured out the cooking time was spot on.\n \n  For such a large oven, this price is very reasonable.  I like the door design differently.It feels very stylish and upscale.  It is not an electronic touch screen design, but a manual rotation design.  This is a perfect complement to my kitchen, an extra cooking option when cooking holidays meals.So far so good,we are still learning make different food.\n \n  I love it! It's easy to use and looks great on my countertop. The only two problems I have: the sides and top get very hot; no crumb pan was included although in both the ad and in the instructions, it said that it was included.\n \n  This is very good. It can be used for anything like cookies, cakes and other. It is very effective and can be used for stuff like roasting a duck or chicken. It can go pretty high up in the range of temperature and it has a timer that dings when it\u2019s done. It is very easy to transport which is really good. Very handy and would highly recommend in a house.\n \n  This oven is very good and I like it very much. I bought pizza and marinated chicken from Costco and put it in the refrigerator at home. When I'm hungry, I just take it out and bake in this oven.  There is a lot of space inside, the food is roasted quickly, and it is evenly baked, and the color of the grill is very good and it smells good.  It is a highly recommended product and the price is very reasonable.\n \n  The only downside is that IT IS NOISY.  The controls are not digital and you can hear the loud, constant clicking of the manual timer as it cooks.  I have my unit outside in my Sheshed so it doesn't bother me but if it was going in my kitchen, I would have to rethink this purchase.\n ", "\n  I disliked the fact that there are levels that on each side that should hold the rack up and my rack is too small for the oven size. \n  This electric oven is great!  I like that it's big enough to accommodate double doors and has two temperature controls for two different heights.  I like a timer!  This size is perfect for grilling large foods and is very convenient.  The heating speed is fast, and the design is very simple and beautiful.  Use it to make a hearty meal for my family.\n \n  What I like : It's easy to use. Meets our needs. Makes a full size pizza \n  I followed the directions by reading the entire manual first as I have never had one of these. The instructions tell me to heat oven up to 450 degrees before use to burn off any manufacture and packaging sediments that may be there. I did that and my oven is no where near a wall or tight place. Doing this my vent side looks like it melted/caved in. I did email the manufacture. I am waiting for a response. I was so excited to get this as my oven makes my pizzas fold up like a sandwich. I cant see cooking a turkey in this as it states it will.\n \n  This is a fenomenal oven for the price I\u2019ve cooked pizzas and whole chickens in this bad boy love the double doors and knobs very easy to read doesn\u2019t take long to beat up and it also matches with all of my stainless steel appliances all in all I love my new oven\n \n  This item works better than the Convection Oven I had by Waring.  It is roomy enough to hold a medium 20lb turkey.  It is light weigh and easy to clean.  This was the ideal item for my use.  Yes, you can cook a feast for entertainment. I cook all dishes for my Thanksgiving and X-mas dinner.\n \n  The oven has no frills. Just 3 simple knobs. It works very well! The feature I like most is it will not start until you put the timer on and the oven will stop when the timer goes off. No worries if you leave the house and you forget you turned it on . Plus the crumb tray help to keep it clean!\n \n  The label for the knobs wiped off partially with first cleaning and completely gone by the second wipe down.  This was after baking some bacon and wiping down off the oil splatter.  The oil from the bacon and the heat completely soften up the ink on the knob labels and it just wiped off with a dry paper towel With the first wipe. Other than that issue, overall it works well and because of it\u2019s large size, it can easily be cleaned and is a good product for the price.\n \n  The recommend by one of my relatives so \uff49decided to try it out and they sure don\u2019t disappoint I like the color for the outside and I like the electric oven for the stable and it has four feet in the below. Te quality is perfect for this price.\n \n  I do with the knobs were easier to use. You can not see where your actually setting the temperature or the time. Do not use it as often as I thought I would. But it does work.\n ", "\n  I'm so impressed with this toaster oven. The oven is simple to use. The knobs are clearly marked so it's truly just a matter of setting it and letting the oven do its job. So far I've made a small cake, some mini pizzas, and warmed up leftovers and they've all come out perfectly. This has been getting a lot of use in my kitchen lately and will continue to do so. I'm highly satisfied with this and will definitely be recommending it to others.\n \n  It\u2019s a learning curve . Wish the doors fit better and maybe made of a thermal blocking material . It\u2019s nice to see your stuff but better to hold the heat in\n \n  i like it very much. It\u2019s easy to use and convenient. It doesn\u2019t take much space and definitely better than my last one and can fit a lot more when baking, taking up less time to finish baking. I would def recommend.\n \n  I am so pleased with this toaster oven. I bought this one to replace an older one of smaller size, this one works much better. I love the size and the French doors open up so easy. Very easy to clean, easy to operate and big enough for almost everything. \n  Double doorknob oven Roast chicken Grilled fish There's nothing wrong with toast or something And the temperature is well controlled It's clean I love it Will buy back\n \n  the only good thing I can say about this toaster oven is it is large. Size means nothing when it doesn't function. It took one hour and 15 mins to cook some fries and they still never was crispy at all! not big on doing reviews but the temp controls aren't clear If you want 400 degrees you pretty much have to guess as there are no lines to tell you where to set the dial. Also it came in a regular cardboard box (not the original box) definitely WOULDN'T Ever recommend this toaster oven to anyone\n \n  Got it home, unpacked and followed instructions for first time use. Made a humble baked potato first. Cooked considerably faster than my old countertop oven, and the potato was fluffy with a crispy skin. I love the double doors, and it's much bigger inside than my old one. I'm gonna rotisserie a chicken next. So glad I got this. Cook's Essentials has come through with another winner\n \n  Great size, extra large pizza fit nicely in the oven.  Best result for cooking is to use upper and lower temperature settings concurrently.  The top gets warm and worked well as a warmer for casserole dish.  Love the french doors.  If it was a convection, oven it would be perfect.  Overall it was a good purchase.\n \n  This is a very big oven. It can even fit a turkey inside. Easy to use and easy to clean. It can cook very fast because it can get very hot. Very durable and has great quality. Very precise temperatures and highly recommended to anyone.\n \n  First double door oven and it\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s easy to operate and great for quick meals. Convenient because of the size and saves time when I don\u2019t have to use the larger oven. Cooks food evenly and easy to bake without using the larger oven. Great size and good for its price!\n ", "\n  I bought this with the hope that it would be as good as it\u2019s higher priced competitors and I\u2019m so happy I did I\u2019m so impressed and it a amazing oven \n  Works well\n \n  I ordered this extra large, stainless steel, toaster oven for my house. With this I can fit an abundant amount of food in the oven especially since I have a big family. I can control the temperature and the time. I like that it\u2019s different because it has two doors I can open, it looks nicely designed.\n \n  It looks great and warms good, but the trays that sit in the oven the bottom on and the wire rack dont stay on the \"track\" to be able to set anything on them they just fall, I was able to fix the wire rack to stay  but the bottom tray doesn't want to stay. But still excited to use it.\n \n  Nice oven. Great price. Unfortunately I had to return. Brought it to save counter space but it just took up way too much space.\n \n  It takes too long to warm up food. We had to put the pizza in the microwave oven.\n \n  Works perfectly matches other appliance's perfectly love the large size capacity cheaper alternative than buying new stove thank you so much\n \n  I got this oven for Christmas because I wanted a counter-top oven that I could use when there are times that I needed a double oven.  It was definitely HUGE! It felt \"cheap\" but I thought if it works it's worth it.  Unfortunately, when I plugged it in, it didn't work.  I tried it in another outlet but it was the oven.  I sent it back.  I'm back to researching and looking for a different one.\n \n  This toaster oven is completely satisfied my baking need.  It\u2019s big enough to put in the whole chicken or turkey which makes my cooking process a lot easier.  And it can even fit in the whole frozen pizza. Definitely worth buy and will recommend to my friends.\n \n  I love this thing!!  The supersize is wonderful. This oven is like getting a new toy.\n ", "\n  This is just a large toaster and does not have over features as comparable other priced devices. The best feature is the French doors.\n \n  The timer hasn't worked since we got it but it was on sale so I guess we can't be too picky?\n \n  I absolutely love this portable oven. Easy to use and he\u2019s not extremely well\n \n  I haven\u2019t use my actual oven since I received this, it is absolutely amazing\n \n  We are very happy with this toaster oven.  We love the size but wish the door was a one pull to open both doors automatically.\n \n  Love it, the size is fabulous, The price was right and the dials were not digital which I preferred. It was better than I expected. Love love love it. The dual heating elements......perfect so far,\n \n  It\u2019s no light inside and that makes difficult to see food more accurately\n \n  Doesn\u2019t cook evenly\n \n  Love this, cooks well only issue is there is just one rack\n \n  I like this toaster oven ", "\n  This oven is just right for me. I love that is has more space to cook in. It's very easy to use too.\n \n  Right decision to buy. Worth the money.\n \n  So this bad boy has been a lifesaver! Currently renting a place (most likely temporary/under a year), so I didn\u2019t want to invest in a new oven when mine was broken, so I got this to hold me over and for the most part it\u2019s been great! At times, it may take a few extra minutes/degrees to cook something than it should, but overall, it\u2019s great.\n \n  Everything was great from this product from price to quality.\n \n  I needed this to cook in a hotel room that didn't have a kitchen. Worked great! Did have to cook a little bit longer than usual when baking. Worked great! Handy to have around.\n \n  Cheap made. Bottom burner doesn\u2019t work an the rack is to weak to hide the an with food Loaded in it\n \n  Add a ceramic tile on top of over to reduce HEAT escape.\n \n  Bigger than expected but better too big than too small.  Fits fine in small kitchen with some creative rearranging.  Just what I needed!\n \n  I thought this would be a great product but I\u2019m actually on impressed with its cooking ability. I put brownies in to cook for an hour and they still weren\u2019t done!\n \n  I love the product but gave it four stars because the \"crumb tray\" is missing. Up until now, I haven't contacted Amazon to send a replacement; hoping they will once I do.\n ", "\n  My daughter is in love with this gift only appliance she uses now\n \n  there are two temperature controls for the two different levels. There is a timer built in which I love! The size is perfect for larger items or even just bagels or sandwiches. It heats up quickly and evenly.\n \n  I want to return only because of the racks do not stay where they're supposed to they keep falling and my son mess up the box so I'm stuck with it\n \n  We bought this on March 1 2020. It works well however it is now July and the bottom burner has stopped working, rendering it useless except for basic toasting. Going to go with a more established brand and get the warranty next time.\n \n  I'm a caterer nice always to have an extra oven\n \n  I used it for 2 months already, my experience is terrible, it DOESN'T bake according to the degrees, for example trying to bake a cake at 350 degrees, takes twice as much time, sometimes even longer! I have to put it as highest so that it can bake. So i have been baking at 450 or else it comes out raw. :/\n \n  it is hard to read the temp setting and which is for top and bottom is not marked\n \n  best thing ive bought in a long time\n \n  I bought this oven for my mom's birthday gift. She likes it and say will use it to prepare a feast for the whole family. The oven is good size for a whole turkey and fast heat up. Also clean is very easy.\n \n  Things are good and the space is huge!\n ", "\n  use of this item is to be strictly as extension oven. It serves it\u2019s purpose. Very functional no bells and whistle\u2019s strictly a large toaster oven used for just that large quantities of toast or Oven extension.\n \n  What I like about this oven large enough to bake cookies am pizza.\n \n  Cooks as good as any conventional oven,  great addition to our shop breakroom.\n \n  Love it works great\n \n  Great oven, large and simple to use and clean. Mine came with a crumb tray unlike other reviewers. I added a hanging thermometer to keep track of the temp variance and it is consistently +/- 25\u00b0 F.  Definitely better than the large digital Oster version it replaced.\n \n  The quality of the oven is very good. Big enough. It can be put on three layers. You can also roast chicken. The delivery speed is also very fast. Easy to operate. The price is worth buying!\n \n  Would recommend.\n \n  the wire rack is VERY weak .. should be more stable for the size of the oven .. other than that. it works GREAT and is used daily.\n \n  Love it\n \n  I purchased this oven .... yes it worked ok BUT it was dented which I was very disappointed about.\n ", "\n  So far I'm happy with it! Like how it's pretty and it's bigger than I expected, but it's to early so 4star for now I only used it once\n \n  Great product\n \n  Works Great & Great Product To Have.\n \n  Ease of use.\n \n  I'm not in love with the french style doors & the shelves are not very sturdy.  If you put something too heavy on the shelves, they crash down, not amazing when you have a full casserole going in!\n \n  Great but mine came without any racks.... granted the world is having a global pandemic i think the manufacturing slipped and amazon shouldn\u2019t have to catch the ball\n \n  Bought this oven for my parents, they really enjoy to have it, with it\u2019s large space can contain tons of food, also support separate heat pipe temperature control to make cooking easier, with this price, can\u2019t image it could this good.\n \n  Light cooking\n \n  Product is great, but through no fault of Amazon, when we received this oven, there was a big dent on the bottom. It doesn't seem to have interfered with the functionality of the oven but it's a little upsetting to get something brand new and have it dented.\n \n  Love it, was so excited when it arrived, but was disappointed because it is missing the crumb tray. How can I get it?\n ", "\n  Love the size !!!\n \n  The best part is the French door style and the glass that allows you to see it cook work perfect I have no complaints\n \n  I've had this oven for almost two years, using it as my ONLY oven and it's done an amazing job all the way around, still going strong. Worth every penny and then some .\n \n  the most accurate temp control that i have found . not perfect but so close it doesn't matter!!!! \n  It works great. Mainly used it for baking buns, but have used it for main dishes. Love it\n \n  Es muy c\u00f3modo\n None \n  The oven arrived and looks like it could be great, but there was no baking tray included as indicated.  other accessories were there, but the missing piece is extremely annoying.

Perfect for an \u201coven\u201d\n \n  Stopped working after 1 use\n ", "\n  Temp control is troubling  with some things being cooked\n \n  Outstanding in everyway\n \n  I was use it more than half year, it\u2019s awesome!  Easy to clean. Easy set up temperature!\n \n  the oven works fine, but the package did not contain the crumb tray.  How do I go about receiving the crumb try?\n \n  I wish it only had one temperature control.  I love that you can bake larger 2 pizzas and bake cookies\n \n  Please send me missing crumb tray! i like the oven but was surprised there wasn't any crumb tray anywhere.\n \n  Actually I purchased this toaster oven for myself, but my mother in law kept it cause she likes the size. It\u2019s easy to use, and a good size for turkey! I am thinking to get another one for myself. Definitely will recommend to friends!\n \n  I really like the large capacity\n \n  Amazing oven!! It's huge and has a lot of room to place your foods. The top and bottom temperature controls is amazing for cooking more than one item. The crumb tray is great for cleaning instead of having to clear out the bottom of the oven yourself. Convenient and great for it's price.\n \n  Purchased this table top oven for a nursing home baking group.  Great that it is  portable and can be used in multiple areas around the facility.\n ", "\n  I love the size and ease of use for the Luby toaster oven with French doors. The only change involve the need to update the user manual and remove the information about an non existing crumb tray.\n \n  The timer broke after about 15-20 uses.\n \n  Bought this as a bread oven that could sit on the counter top because it\u2019s hard for me to bend over continuously. \n  Got my shipment very quickly and it is very light weight compare to others, very useful for all kind baking!

It has a ton of flaws, but it is inexpensive and does roast and bake effectively.  Its alright as an oven for the price, but it is terrible as a toaster. \n  Oven was well-packaged, arrived in-tact (but missing a tray, see picture). The dual temperature-controls is a really nice feature, making the top-broiler hotter/colder than bottom coils. Operation is simple and straight-forward, but lack of convection (fan) is an amazingly-poor design choice for an oven this size. I found the temperature and time controls to be very accurate. ", "\n  This is not as physically large as I feared from the description, and the french doors really help in keeping the footprint while in use manageable.  Heat is an issue, as the cabinet back and bottom are the only sheet metal, so make sure the shelf it sits on is heat tolerant, as is the back of anything it is near.  Painted drywall walls could be a problem if you don't leave a couple of inches of gap.  The sides and the top have an outer wall and some air space to help insulate, but the top still gets pretty darned hot. \n  I know this says extra large, but wow, it looks ridiculous in my small kitchen. I really wish I could use it, as it gives a ton of space for family use. The one we had been using only fit food for one when making say chicken bites and french fry type meals. My small one gets hot on the outside too, but with this one being so big, it does obviously put out more heat, so it kind of defeats the purpose of keeping the kitchen cooler in the summer months. All of these things though are neither good nor bad in and of themselves, just more what a customer is looking for. If you need a really big toaster oven, have the space for it on your counters, are not concerned about temp in the room, etc. this one would suit your needs just fine. It is actually very stylish. The upper and lower heat controls give you more luxury depending on what you are cooking. The crumb tray would have been nice to protect the heat source on the bottom, but again, this is all needs based. Just pay attention when buying to measurements and your particular needs for a toaster oven.\n \n  TL:DR? This is a HUGE sized toaster oven, but watch out for the closing glass doors (one of ours won\u2019t stay open) and its mammoth size may be problematic on most counters. \n  Below are my Pro's and Cons for this toaster oven. \n  This oven is large enough to bake most of the dishes for our whole family. I like the dual heating elements on the top and bottom of the oven, because it bakes the food uniformly. And the option of having individual temperature control settings makes this oven unique in my experience. This feature specially helps when baking pies, no more burned pies tops. And also, we're baking our own bread, cookies and pizzas in it. None None None \n  \u00a0I love my oven...my brother purchased for me Saturday 11/16/19 I got it Monday 11/18/19 \n  This extra large toaster oven is great!  I like using out in place of the regular oven sometimes during the summer, so the house doesn't warm up as much.  The size is good. But the size is a hindrance if you want to keep it on your counter or even store it. I appreciate the size when actually using it, but it is so big when storing it.  I finally made a spot on a shelf in the nearest closet.  It cooks, makes, toasts, etc. great. Highly recommended.\n \n  This is a very large toaster oven. You\u2019re going to want to find a large space for it to stay in your kitchen. It\u2019s a small oven, and because of that it gets hot on all its sides. The temperature seems to be quite consistent and accurate. It cooks things nicely. The doors open and close easily. No main issues with it.\n \n  Takes up lots of counter space.  Temp settings are ok.  The outside gets extremely hot.  So be very careful around children.  It\u2019s like having a very hot oven on your counter.\n \n  The toaster oven has a very nice design to it, the double doors are nice. I like the tray it comes with for the bottom which works well for cooking food. My only complaint is how large it is, It just fit under our kitchen cabinets but we're okay with that.\n ", "\n  New to Tovala, wish I had this sooner. Great food that upgraded my meals from \"single bachelor\" (frozen/takeout) to healthy eating both in Tovala delivered meals or perfectly searing/baking chicken breasts/pork I got from the grocery store. As someone that won't have time to cook from scratch anytime soon, having Tovala on hand has been awesome.\n \n  There is no chassis here, missing the chassis shown in figure 11, which needs to be sent back to me\n \n  It is a good product I look forward to! It\u2018s good deal and good work!\n \n  This Luby Extra Large 55L toaster oven, 16 Slices,14'' pizza,20lb Turkey, White,Stainless Steel is attractive and I am enjoying the extra large size, which is almost like having an extra oven in the house. I do a lot of cooking and baking, and I've always wanted a second oven, so this Luby helps a lot. The big clear tempered glass doors make what I'm cooking easily visible, and my favorite feature is that I can set the temperature of the top and bottom heating elements independently. I can crisp the bottom of my pies or pizzas hotter, for example, or just broil the cheese on top of my casserole. \n  The Luby extra large toaster oven has a unique design that imparts a touch of class to it's form & unique functionality, in the form of it's ability to individualy control the temperature setting for both top & bottom heating elements/burners. \n  our oven recently decided to quit heating correctly and my son is a pizza fanatic so it was a major catastrophe but I knew I had this toaster oven we hadn't tried yet so talked him into giving it a try and I have to tell you it was the best idea ever!!! Why you ask?  Because my son is one of those people who preheat an over forever before actually cooking something \u2026 with this toaster oven he has to stay in the same area as the oven while it preheats and during cooking time since it will shut itself off after so long (unlike the regular oven).  Also, when he visits his dad's house he won't cook in the oven or on the stove because it's a gas stove and demon child doesn't like it so I had him take the toaster oven with him and he's been pretty content with his diet staying the same as it is when he's at my house. \n  Bought this semi used through Amazon.  What a find!  \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\udc4d.  Couldn\u2019t be more pleased with my purchase.\n \n  Very pleased with this counter-top oven.  It has more than ample interior space and it is possible to cook on two racks at one time.\n \n  Due to an illness in the family (MCS), I had to migrate all my cooking to my back deck so I wouldn't be adding any VOCs from cooking into the air.  This oven is large enough to hold most 9\"X13\" casserole dishes.  It does whole chickens very well.  Though I haven't had it for a year yet, it's been working really well despite being outside the entire time.  Now, it's not exposed to any rain since my deck is covered, but even in freezing weather, it seems to do just fine holding temperature.  I just wish the dials were a bit easier to read in low-light conditions.  But if you can't use a full-sized oven for some reason, this one works really well.\n \n  First of all, it's just a large steel box with independent heating controls for baking and/or broiling, and a timer. That's it - there is no forced convection (no fan or control for one) or interior light. ", "\n  Since I only use toaster ovens for baking and am of the opinion that most toaster ovens try to do too many things, I was happy to find this Luby. Not only is it especially built to bake, it is huge, easily holding a small turkey. What an asset this oven would be to families cooking over the holidays or wanting to bake a dish in their regular oven and a cake or dish in the Luby. Or, as in my case, to do all their baking in it since toaster ovens are a thousand times cooler to use than a stove oven especially in the summer. They heat up quicker and cool down faster as well. \n  Really like this oven, Ive used the Wolfgang Puck one for about five years now and it stopped working. So this is our second counter oven and I love the size it is. It's fairly big but still fits underneath the standard cabinet counter spacing. Doesn't get too hot around it even though it does get hot. 3 things I dislike about it the doors don't have a way to stay open so if there's any off balance on your counter one closes or opens and they just swing there and when they get hot it's swinging into your hand. Secondly there's no light so you can't see the crust of the pizza or the edges of the cookies, Very difficult. Thirdly you can't put anything heavier than a pizza in it. As soon as I put a roast or a turkey in, the sides of the oven push in and the rack falls all the way down, so it is sitting on the heating elements. I literally had to put a metal cup inside to hold up the Turkey for Thanksgiving...\n \n  Really great oven for smaller dishes or heating up leftovers. The size of the oven is large enough to fit an entire frozen pizza, and includes two racks so you can prepare two trays of baked goods at once. So far we\u2019ve made pizza, cookies, pie and more and they\u2019ve all come out perfectly. In fact, I\u2019m finding that I\u2019m using this toaster oven even more than my actual oven, especially since this heats up much quicker than our main oven. \n  I live in a rural area and when the igniter for my gas oven died and the only appliance repair people told me that they wouldn't be able to get around to repairing my oven until after Christmas, I bought a toaster oven to help me get through my holiday baking. The oven arrived THE NEXT DAY and I promptly set it up. \n  UPDATE: \n  I am writing this review after one month of actual cooking experience. It\u2019s large which is for me a great feature. It\u2019s not a toaster oven it\u2019s a counter top oven. If you use it like an oven it is easy to use and understand. I preheat the oven both top and bottom elements. Then if baking turn the bottom element to desired temp. If I am in a hurry turn the top element to 150 if not turn it off. Used it for hours baking cookies. I highly recommend this oven. Single or a family this oven will become your oven of choice.  Some will say not having a stay on option is an issue not for me I like to turn my item just like I do with my regular oven. Just add more time.\n \n  It baffles me that so many that reviewed this oven said they did not receive a crumbtray, there was nothing missing when i received mine, and here is a little hint...while the wire cooking rack IS a bit flimsy, i used 2 of my small cookie sheets as cooking trays, they fit the oven perfectly. The first thing i cooked was baked chicken, it cooked in the normal amount of time, held correct temp and turned out perfect, next i baked cookies, again, no problems. And have done a turkey breast, made 9 small rolls of homemade summer sausage, AND even dehydrated carrots, celery and tomatoes to used when i make soup. While as stated by some, the exterior DOES get pretty hot but its the same with any toaster like oven. It IS very light weight again as stated by many but i dont see where that affected the ovens performance. \n  I was really worried about spending so much on an oven like this but it was needed as our original toaster oven died and we would have no oven otherwise \n  Really large and cooks a 22 lb turkey with much room to spare.  This is the largest countertop oven that I could find.  I like that there are knobs and a mechanical timer and nothing digital.  I didn't want a fan.  Simply another thing to fail!  My large built-in oven failed because it was digital and the Electronic Control Board failed.  I like the double French doors.  They make it easier to get into the oven.  Some complaints though.  The mechanical timer can only be set for a maximum of 60 minutes.  After that the oven turns off.  There is no Stay On feature.  It would at least be nice for the maximum time to be greater.  Also the tray is not that secure and can easily fall down onto the bottom heating elements if one does not carefully place the turkey onto the tray.  The grooves on the sides for sliding the tray and grill in should be deeper.\n \n  I love this oven. I use it to proof my yeast dough, it does a wonderful job. The only problem I have with it is the oven shuts off when the timer goes off. There are lots of things I bake for much longer then an hour. There also are not enough marks for temperature regulation. Its hard to tell what temperature you have set the oven having only 150, 250, 350 and 450. The size is really great, it takes a lot of room on the counter so we put it on it's own cart., but it can handle a 14\" pizza with ease. Love the separate heating element controls, you can set them on different temps. and brown things very quickly without burning the bottom. Good little oven.\n ", "\n  The oven is large but I find it doesn't bake stuff worth a damn.  The only thing it does semi-good at is toasting a large quantity of bread.  You can never really tell what the temperature is set at because it's unconventional how they have it labeled so it's a guessing game.  French fries never come out crispy and never try to bake something in it unless it's premade biscuits or something.  We're overall disappointed in it and don't understand how it has a bunch of positive reviews.  I never felt the need to leave a review about anything until now and I've been apart of Amazon for at least 10 years. If my kids didn't open it and start using it before I got home I would have sent it right back.  It took 40 minutes to cook some fries tonight from Frozen state..  I had to turn it up as far as it would go to get them any where near crispy.\n \n  The oven was securely packed in an unmarked box.  After the initial burn off I'm testing it out.  The controls are simple. I'll  need a thermometer though as one of my pastries has to start in a hot oven then drop to a lower temperature.  I'm glad I'm taking the oven to work so the company pays the electric bill, lots of heat comes through the glass.  The oven came just in time for me to bake cookies at work.  I've got to keep the maintenance men happy.  Amazon sells a Betty Crocker 3 cookie sheet package. The largest tray 17\" x 11.5\" slips right in and hangs like the tray which comes with the oven.\n \n  The first one I ordered, had a giant dent in it. Not a big deal, I returned it and replaced it. The second one, did not fully heat at all. For something that was supposed to take 30 minutes, took well over an hour and still was not fully cooked. Do not recommend.\n \n  Was looking for an additional oven that was roomy enough to fit standard size baking dishes.  I entertain a lot (before pandemic, of course ;) and was always waiting around for the stuff in my main oven to be done.  This really streamlines my cooking process.  Love the upper AND lower heating units that can be operated independently.  Also, you can time your cooking (a good thing if you tend to forget to turn off the oven).  Or, you can turn the knob to a stay on position.  Would love to have a light inside the oven, but am not complaining - especially for the great price.\n \n  The capacity is great... I can finally can use regular size pans. I'm currently renovating my kitchen and had a smaller toaster oven. It does heat fast. My biggest complaints are (or nice to have) is not having a interior light, no preheating mechanism to know the temperature is right... BUT FOR THE PRICE AND SIZE... I'M HAPPY. \n  I ordered this oven to do powder coating in my garage its roomy inside the oven almost gets up to its rated temperature the door seals ( or lack thereof) dont help the situation and finally to remove power from the oven you MUST unplug it or all the circuitry is still on even if its not heating. as someone said you could bake a small turkey in there - but alas the flimsy wire racks probably are not up to the job \n  I bought this for Thanksgiving as I needed an extra oven to roast 12 lb turkey.  It was perfect.  You do have to be careful as it does get hot but I used it in the basement and nothing was close to it while roasting.  The interior is really big and easily handled my roasting pan.  The down side is that the temperature controller is hard to read but I used a white marker and that is no longer a problem.  The other down side is that the timer is for 60 minutes so you have to make sure to reset it at 60 minutes because it does turn off.  But the down sides, once aware of them, are easily resolved. The price was very reasonable and worth it because I will use it often.\n \n  I love the size! It seems to cook things evenly and pretty close to the same time as a large oven. I\u2019m very sad there is not a broil option:( the door will not stay open and we have burned ourselves multiple times.\n \n  The oven is amazing!! It heats up quickly and so far has cooked everything evenly. It\u2019s also very nice that there is more than one layer to bake at once and it is very easy to use! The instructions were very clear about the usage of the oven and it works perfectly good! I baked some cupcakes and it came out perfectly great! The oven heated fast and the temperature is adjusted easily! The toaster oven is also super easy to clean! I would highly recommend this oven!\n \n  This machine is adequate. Just no bells and whistles. If you want a giant oven that only does what your old Oster countertop unit does, but bigger stuff can fit, then this unit is right for you.  Not great for frozen pizza. Temperature is fairly accurate. Dials are hard to read temp settings. Grab a flashlight, you\u2019re going to need it to see the divots on the knobs. And very probably you will need it to see your food. No internal lights.\n ", "\n  Ordered this item twice and the crumb tray was missing. Did not try a third time. Chose a different brand.\n \n  I ordered this before Thanksgiving because our home oven is not very big. I LOVE it! I use it for all my baking: pizza, cookies, casseroles, you name it. The one thing I love the most, is the ability to control the bottom and top heat how I choose. The instructions say to use one or the other, but I\u2019ve found being able to control both works better and my pizzas and cookies have never been better! Also, this oven has a timer that you set, and when the timer stops, the oven shuts down. So for those who have kids cooking or are forgetful when cooking, this is a great safety feature!\n \n  Phenomenal product!!!!! \n  Purchased to use outside instead of our real oven so as not to heat the house in summer. \n  Very simple oven. Three control knobs -one for the top heating element, one for the bottom heating element, and one mechanical timer that goes only to 60 minutes. comes with one tray and one rack - should come with two racks. Temperature control seems OK. You set the temperature you desire by turning the two heating element control knobs.\n \n  Arrived on time. Painted the indicator line on the knobs white because you couldn\u2019t see when you set your temperature. I also put 2\u201d rubber around handles because they are really hot after cooking. I guess pricing was a little less then some other double doors but you shouldn\u2019t have to do anything to a new product. Noticed others did mention the handles being hot.\n \n  I love this oven. It took a while to figure out the separate element controls, but once I did, this is a great oven. It is the perfect size for all the baking I do.  It does not make my condo to hot.  I recommend thid oven to anyone who is looking for a large counter top oven.\n \n  I love that I can avoid heating up my larger built-in oven - like for a lunch pizza or hot bread for dinner.  It also serves as additional oven space for a large family meal. We previously had a smaller toaster oven and rarely used it.  After it died I decided to try a bigger but more practical option.  I couldn't be happier!\n \n  The oven gets too hot.  Door handles radiate the inner heat. I burnt myself! It's also too large and cumbersome! \n  The picture doesn\u2019t do the toaster any justice. This toaster is humongous it can cook a lot of things and it is very easy to clean.\n ", "\n  We returned, too much power\n \n  Pro, could handle 17lb Turkey, \n  The oven came dented on one side. Too lazy to return it cuz it\u2019s big and it looks like it still operates. Tried making cupcakes with it and it works; although diff materials (silicone, Darker metal muffin pan and lighter pan) makes baking time vary quite a lot. Felt like one of the heat bars doesn\u2019t get as hot as the others. Will need to try more baking.\n \n  Not what I was expecting it to be. Would of been nice to have better instructions on how to use it.  Still need to trw baking 2 pans of rolls before I could change my mind.  Definitely not a conversation oven.\n \n  I'm impressed, just as described, with the stay on feature.  Quick to warm up, spacious, easy to use, works well.  It is a beast as far as size goes, but I still like to use it, daily.\n \n  I bought this oven for powder coating and not for cooking. The dual temperature control is a nice feature and the oven comes to temperature nicely. Works great for my powder coating so I'm sure it would be great for cooking .\n \n  Great for baking! The oven is pretty big and can fit large sized things. The oven is high quality and stylish wish 2 doors. The oven also keeps the heat in very well and has a bottom AND top heating piece each having separate temperature knobs and one timer.\n \n  This oven was purchased because our regular oven was broken and we really missed having Thanksgiving dinner at home. We cooked a 20 lb turkey and it came out great. Our Luby oven does everything a traditional oven can do.\n \n  I love my new oven! The temperature is correct,  I tested it with an oven thermometer. Very easy to store away when I'm done.\n \n  Great oven. Only downside is that doors open independently of each other and do not stay open until you shut them. Otherwise I really like using the oven. Exactly as described.\n ", "\n  Not what I was looking for too cheap, doors didn't match up. \n  Much safer with the French doors. No more burned wrists or dropped food. It looks nice on the counter. Fancy. No inner light is my only complaint.\n \n  Love it I bought for thanks giving to give us extra cooking and it worked fantastic\n \n  It is a great oven but arrived with a significant dent on the back. I assume that it happened in transit as the box was damaged as well\n \n  Great product for the price..its more like a small oven than a toaster oven..good for baking and broiling..\n \n  Racks do not fit to small fall right to bottom of oven now I have to waste my time and money to send it back.\n \n  Really liking this oven.  Use it daily. Thought about it a long time, had it in my cart.... finally bought it and i'm glad i did,  thank you God.\n \n  I Love this Oven So Big and the Price is Great !!! It Cooks well also and it came to me in just One Day\n \n  It's easy to use we were able to make cakes, and egg rolls in it\n \n  I love how easy this oven is to use! I also like how light weight it is. I was able to bake this cake with ease and the heat was evenly distributed. I can also set the timer and walk away without having to physically be around to make sure the oven turns off. Pretty simple to use! Totally recommend it!\n ", "\n  Easy to use.  Doors make it easy to remove food and clean.\n \n  Super easy to use oven. It\u2019s larger than most toaster ovens and which is what I was looking for. It\u2019s effect for the summer, so you don\u2019t have to make the whole house hot with a conventional oven.\n \n  This product does not have accurate temperature controls.  Very disappointed.\n \n  I was expecting it to be a convection oven and it isn't.\n \n  The oven seems to do the job of being useful for extra tasks as needed.\n \n  Happy happy happy. Love this thing. It is so big inside can cook lots at a time. But not much more counter space. Doors easier to clean.\n \n  I love this oven. Its so pretty. Its big enough for me to not use my standard oven so much.\n \n  M kitchen is too small for the size of the oven. I never used it.\n \n  Oven was damaged in shipping but realized months after it was received(bought to teach a summer camp home economic class) even damaged the oven worked and was true temperature. Hopefully won't have future problems.\n \n  Would recommend this\n ", "\n  Superior oven. Independent controls for upper and lower elements makes this a true oven.\n \n  Perfect unit for what I was looking for... small batch of cookies, medium turkey, prime rib... everything I could wish for.\n \n  Great\n \n  Wonderful product and quality\n \n  I love it so much .\n \n  Like the size but takes a little longer to cook food\n \n  Did not recieve a drip pan with the idem .and i need a rotisserie bar\n \n  I like the frech doors. This oven is \"big\" compared to others. I've used it to season my cast iron skillets. My 8 year old daughter likes to make cupcakes. It works fine.\n \n  The bottom heating element quit working in less than 6 months after purchase.  Amazon will not refund or replace.  Don't waste your money on this.\n \n  The crumb tray is missing if you send it to me will be better,because i can not send back the all item because of the missing part.\n ", "\n  My son and daughter in law love it. They just wish it had an additional rack in it.\n \n  Cooking&baking\n \n  Great product, fast delivery will buy again.\n \n  This oven works fine, if you can figure out the directions. There are two heating knobs, for upper and lower heating elements. The drections aren't too clear on when you use which knob. I eventually just experimented with something foolproof, like roasted vegetables, so now I think I get it. Aside from toast, (and the aformentioned vegetables), the oven can do much of what a regular oven can, within the limits of 450 degrees. I wouldn't use it to make something that needs precision, like baked goods. But for re-heating stuff you don't want in the micro, or for an auxiliary oven, it's OK.\n \n  The Amazon description has the words \"Removeable crumb tray\", but they look like a cut and paste error.  The manual strongly implies a crumb tray comes with it.  I got no crumb tray.  It really needs a crumb tray. \n  Our home oven doesn't work very well, it's one of those in-wall ovens from the 50s and only the top burner works, and the company that made it is long gone so we can't get replacement parts. That is no longer an issue because now we just make basically everything in this toaster oven! The thing is absolutely massive so can fit almost anything, the only thing it can't fit is a full-sized cooking tray, but it comes with its own one which has more area than a regular cooking tray, it's just a little less long so it fits. It heats up super fast and after baking with it several times the temperature seems accurate as every loaf of bread has come out looking perfect. None None None \n  \u00a0This is incredible !!!! \n  I have a Black and Decker convection toaster oven i've been using for a couple years. I've only had this one for a month but I like this one alot more. A couple main reasons for this: \n  This thing is huge, it takes up a lot of real estate.  It is made well and works great though.  I have baked in it, and have toasted in it and both comes out great. I think the handle to lift the pan out is a great feature and works well.  I really like making warm toasted sandwiches in it.  The size may be hard for some to fit it in their kitchen.  Be sure to measure first.  I have never heard of the brand, but seems to work well.  As with all toasters, the top gets very hot in use.\n \n  This is a HUGE toaster oven, much larger than I anticipated, so not ideal for people with limited counter space. Still, on a hot day, if you are trying to avoid heating up the house with your larger oven, this easily cooks enough for a family. The oven is easy to use and does the job pretty well for a Toaster Oven. All in all, a good choice for someone looking for a  larger countertop oven.\n ", "\n  Ours only has one door, not as pictured above. We really like the way it cooks and are happy with the toast. What we don't like is the very loud vibrating noise it makes.  Sometimes my husband can get it to quiet down by squeezing the sides,  I don't have the knack. He's sure a screw was left out in the manufacturing process. I read a lot if reviews and nobody else mentioned this so we will be exchanging it for another one.\n \n  We are super happy with this toaster oven!  It works very well and matches all our other stainless steel appliances. Much easier and safer for my kids to use than a regular oven too!\n \n  Very easy to use. Works great. My kids love popping pizza rolls in here. Works pretty fast. Doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space.\n "]}, "/BREVILLE-BOV650XL-Counter-Oven-Silver/product-review/B00357YS3A/ref=sxin_7?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B00357YS3A&cv_ct_cx=oven&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source&dchild=1&keywords=oven&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B00357YS3A&pd_rd_r=9ced2fa1-ad75-48bd-8f84-ae3315c634b5&pd_rd_w=cDgMy&pd_rd_wg=Ca86i&pf_rd_p=9e4ba918-f6ad-4007-841c-6563d381515f&pf_rd_r=TPFMSWA0170V0ZZA0PTQ&qid=1597683407&sr=1-1-72d6bf18-a4db-4490-a794-9cd9552ac58d&tag=mashcontent-20": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["Smart element IQ: There\u2019s heat, and there\u2019s smart heat; Element IQ transfers heat intelligently across 4 quartz elements for accurate and stable heat just where and when you want it for perfect results, every time", "8 cooking functions: 8 cooking functions to guide you to perfection: Toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies and reheat", "All the room for delicious you\u2019re looking for: 4 Slice Toaster, 12 inches Pizza, 6 cup muffin tray, roast chicken and anything else you\u2019ve got for it", "Backlit easy read LCD: Calculates correct time and temperature, Illuminating orange during preheating and cooking, and blue once cycle is complete", "Non stick cavity coasting: The walls on the inside of the oven feature a non-stick coating for easy cleaning", "Capacity: 4 slice toaster oven, 12 inch pizza"], "Product Description": ""}, "Reviews": ["\n  Bought to replace an old Black and Decker toaster oven that finally died after more than a decade of use.  I was never really happy with it because it was poor at making toast and took too long to toast everything from plain bread to English Muffins or bagels, etc. \n  Was happy with purchase until I got an E01 error code. Unplugged & plugged it back in. Worked OK until another E01 error code. The manual says  this is a \"non-resettable\" issue code and that I should unplug and call customer support immediately. Now going thru a return and replace warranty process. Spent a lot of time on hold until I could actually talk to someone. Not happy with customer support and exchange process. \"Advance replacement\" means they will charge my credit card until they get the original unit back. Hopefully all will go well going forward. \n  Temperature was off by 25\u00b0F.  When set on bake at 450\u00b0F, the oven never went above 425\u00b0F.  I expect a oven in this price range to be more precise.\n \n  UPDATE : Nearly two years old and used every single day and we are just as pleased as the day it first arrived. There are some reviews which claim it wouldn't last 6 months or a year, well the Breville unit we received is rapidly approaching its second birthday. \n  Please note, almost all reviews are from people who have not had this unit for very long.  I assumed since the price was on the high side, it would be a lasting small appliance.  It was fantastic for the first year, however, we have had this toaster over for about 3-4 years.  The lower heating elements had burned out rather early on, and we had to flip the bread to get it evenly toasted.  Finally that was getting old, we ordered a new heating element, about a $15 part.  My husband who is very handy, could not figure out how to get the outer casing off to access the heating elements, but I was determined, looked up online how to remove the outer shell, (not much help online) finally figured it out after removing about 2 dozen screws, some hidden, and taking photos all along the way to remember what goes where and in what order.  I got to where the electrical connections were for the lower heating elements and found out the Power PCB panel was scorched.  At that point, we were not sure if we needed a Power PCB panel as well ($35) and did not trust after reading some not so good reviews from people like us, who had something electrical issues after just a year or two. \n  First day I used the oven an error code showed on the diaplay 'due to a non-resettable issue' which requires unplugging the unit immediately and contacting Breville customer service. I bought this at a deep Black Friday discount..... if you did the same and are gifting this for Christmas Beware! Be sure to test it within the 30 day return window. After that you'll be looking at paying $30-$40+ to ship the item to Breville for repair or replacement.\n \n  We purchased this toaster oven several weeks ago and have been totally happy with it. Like many reviewers, we zeroed in on this oven based upon the many positive reviews we read. However, I'd like to address some of the negatives I read before my purchase and give you my take on them: \n  I bought this as a gift for my fianc\u00e9, mostly because it was the much-discussed \"Siracusa toaster\". After unpacking the toaster and following the quick start instructions, we sat patiently waiting for it to pre-heat to 425F. After a couple minutes, there was a series of loud beeps followed by an error message \"E03\" displayed on the LCD screen. Looking that code up in the manual, it just says to unplug the toaster immediately and contact customer service. We decided to return it to Amazon rather than take our chances dealing with replacement units, which based on other reviews here sound likely to be similarly defective. It sounds like this brand used to be decent, but nowadays at least, it's not worth the price.\n \n  I should have read some of the negative reviews.  Within two months the bottom of the toast stopped toasting well, and then we realized that the plug portion of the cord had melted into the back of the oven (the slanted portion of it).  This shouldn't even be possible; it's poorly designed.  Now I have a toaster oven I paid $110 for, and have had for 3 months, and it's garbage.  Of course it's outside of the return window.  I had the bigger version of this oven several years ago and it died a dramatic death after a couple of years; I should have known better than to trust Breville again.\n \n  Received product on March 14, 2019. On April 9, 2019 unit would not heat. Only timer display worked. Tried to call Breville but told hold time in excess of 35 minutes. This product was rated top by consumer Reports. Good results while working ut obviously defective product.\n ", "\n  This is a very high quality toaster/oven, well worth the $179.95 cost, except for one problem.  It can't toast bread evenly on both sides.  The top is always significantly darker regardless of where you place the rack or where you place the bread.  I just got off the phone with Breville and they stated that this is not a problem.  The \"toaster\"/oven was designed to function that way!!!  I was incredulous.  If you like your toast toasted evenly on both sides, buy something else.\n \n  I was very excited to have my first Breville oven as they have very good rating and so on. It's been few weeks that it had arrived and I just realized that the button for Temp and Time is flipped. So if you push Temp button, Time appears and for Time button, Temp appeared. It's very confusing every time I use it and since it's a bulky item and I already threw out the box, I'm just very annoyed that I ended up with defective item that I cannot easily exchange that I will possibly use for years... It will probably tick me off every time I use as it's been the case...\n \n  I've had this toaster oven for 7 years and it performed wonderfully for all that time. It's solidly built unlike most tinny ovens made by other companies and it always baked, toasted and broiled evenly and quickly. But yesterday it finally quit on me. Doing a little research through Google, I found that it's fixable, unlike most small appliances which are throwaways. All that's needed is to replace the thermal fuse, a two dollar part, but that requires some technical skills. Fortunately this in in my wheelhouse and I think it's worth giving it a shot. If the repair fails, I'll probably upgrade to the convection model. The newer version has an interior light as well which is another nice feature.\n \n  Overall a pretty good oven for its size. Temperature is slightly off but that\u2019s to be expected from most ovens. Electricity bill spiked up a bit, but electric ovens have rarely been energy efficient. \n  Whatever temperature you set the oven to, the indicator will ding that it has reached that temperature, but in reality it is 100 degrees off.  I put an oven thermometer inside this oven.  Even after 30 minutes it does not reach to designated temperature.  Do not buy this oven.\n \n  I used to expect that a toaster oven had two practical modes: on or off. This one has opened my eyes. The \"smartness\" of it is real. The different mode settings really do different things to accurize the results. For instance, the bagel setting toasts the top a lot more thoughtfully than the bottom, so you get the satisfying crunchiness just where you want it. The very first thing I tried to test it out, was a half turkey breast-- it couldn't have come out better. \n  Bought this on Black Friday, unboxed after Christmas.  It worked on the initial Pizza setting (as directed to burn off residue, automatic 15 minutes) and we used it a few times afterward for toast.  Then all of a sudden we couldn't use it.  Every time we tried it would pop the circuit breaker, so we plugged the old one back in at the same spot and the old one works just fine.  I verified nothing else was drawing on the same circuit -- and since it worked for a few days, I do not believe it is my house wiring.  Back it goes.  Glad for the extended holiday returns! \n  Had a neighbor unpack this big box for me as I had back fusion surgery 2 wks ago. Yesterday I read the How To Booklet in preparation for Toast this morning .  I followed all directions many times-finally called Breville- got a nice gal on the phone+walked thru everything. NONE OF THE HEATING ELEMENTS WORK !!!! Again bothering friends to pack/move to car. They are sending me a new one(which I told them to test b/4 sending to me-hope they do this) Bought this as Consumer Reports has this rated #1  !!!!!  Someone at Breville needs to check their Quality Control dept  systems. \n  Upon learning the negative health effects of microwave ovens, we decided to get rid of ours and hoped that this Breville would take up all the functions of our microwave. We've been using it for a year now daily, and have been delighted with its quality and function! It seems these days that many small appliances are built to break down and need replacing, and that was true of our last counter top oven. But I researched deeply and am so glad I tried out this brand as it lives up to its claims to be a great small oven! We mostly use it to: toast bread daily, heat up leftovers, melt cheese, cook smaller meals (roasting and baking work great!). The oven itself is (refreshingly) high quality stainless steel, as is the pan and broiler pan that fit in the oven. I use the main pan every day, and it still cleans easily with mild soaking. I find the functions of the oven easy to navigate. My husband and I are of retirement age, this oven is the perfect size for our needs. I often will roast a large amount of vegetables and meats in the oven once a week, and/or stir fry or boil on the stove, then use this oven daily to reheat for each meal. When I want to cook for one or two meals, this oven is perfect to use instead of the big oven. The crumb tray is stainless, doesn't stain, and is easy to clean. This oven cost more than other ovens but is well worth the price. I hope the company keeps up the quality of this product for years to come. Highly recommend.\n \n  I have had the Breville BOV650XL for a couple of weeks.  During that time I have used it to broil a steak and a small salmon filet, as well as baking a coated chicken breast and marinated salmon filet (catching a meat theme here?).  Using my big electric oven to cook for one is something I had never liked to do, but my old toaster oven just didn't cut it for me, since I could never tell if it had reached baking temperature or not.  What I liked about the Breville 650XL was that it really considers itself a \"Counter top oven\", which is what I wanted.  You can preheat, just like a regular oven.  So far, the times suggested in the manual have worked out ok, as has my previous experiences.  In fact, for the baked chicken breast, the suggested time for the coating mix was a bit too long, so I'll reduce a minute or two next time.  It heats up well, so I have to resist the temptation to add extra time.  The enameled baking dish and broiler pan have cleaned up well so far.  I haven't used the other settings yet but I like that the designers have considered what most people would use an oven this size for.  If I'm going to do something big, or, say several loaves of bread, I'll use the regular oven, but for just a single piece of meat or a few cookies, this will work just fine and not heat up the whole kitchen. ", "\n  This model was top rated by Consumer Reports and so I took a chance and purchased it and glad I did! It fits nicely on my very limited counter space.  It is allot larger than I thought it would be and the smaller size is sufficient for my needs.  It is made well and isn\u2019t flimsy.  My chicken and salmon came out perfect and juicy.  I toast heavy whole grain frozen breads.  After pushing the frozen button and then start, it takes approximately five minutes to defrost and toast. The toast came out perfectly crispy and evenly browned. I haven\u2019t had this quality in toasting bread since I lived at home with my parents and used their 1940\u2019s model toaster that never died. Believe me, I have had many modern day toaster fails. No need for a toaster now and by tossing out mine, it freed up more counter space. I don\u2019t eat bagels and so I have no experience toasting them in this oven, but I can\u2019t imagine why they wouldn\u2019t come out perfect as well.  The 12 inch pizza pan is sold separately and fits perfectly. Can\u2019t wait to try it. This oven is easy to use and easy to clean. The outside of the oven does get hot which isn\u2019t a problem for me, but if you have young children that help in the kitchen, be aware and be careful. I love not having to heat up my full sized oven to make smaller meals. This oven has the capability to do all things my large oven can do?  There are rubber bumpers on the back to keep the oven a safe distance from walls and back splashes.  It\u2019s too early to know how long this will last.  Fingers crossed it lasts me a very long time.\n \n  We have always had a smaller oven to complement our main over.  The Breville looks great in our kitchen and works really well for our needs (toast, pizza, bagels, frozen appetizers). \n  First oven preheated the first time we used it then tripped the circuit breaker. We tried it on multiple circuits just to make sure it was not an issue with that particular circuit. We returned it to Amazon and got a 2nd identical unit. We wanted to give them a chance... Nope 2nd oven did exactly the same thing. We bought a different brand at a local store (also 1800W) and it works just fine. Luckily it didn't cost anything to return. DO NOT BUY THIS\n \n  This is not an inexpensive toaster oven but after using it only 4 times in 3 weeks I got an E01 error code which states, \"Unplug immediately. Cannot be reset, contact Breville.\" Uhmmm, no. The last Breville we had lasted for only two years before it stopped working properly so this was their last chance with me. Thankfully, Amazon made returning it a breeze so I've already got a new toaster oven from a different manufacturer. No more Breville for me.\n \n  I am writing 10 months into use of this oven. From the start, I could never use the broiler, as it burned the steak. Initially, I could put meat in the tray and broil that way. Yesterday, the included broiler pan warped in the oven and arked. Now it won\u2019t brown. Wish I had returned it right away!\n \n  Published measurements on this are way off.  It is much shorter inside.  Just got it and am returning it.  Internal height dimensions are 12L x 10D (or 12 with pizza hump) x 4.5H.  Height is measured with shelf in place on lowest position.  I saw 6\" internal height. That is too short.  Must be returned.  Never used.\n \n  This is our second Breville toaster oven in 4 years. Both broke. The dials on the first one stopped working, and the bottom element on this last one stopped working. So, on to a different brand. Also, neither was really very user-friendly.\n \n  This is was one of the first Breville appliances I purchased (in 2017) and I've enjoyed it over the last two years. So much so that I decide to come back and write a review. My wife and I primarily use this for toasting breads, roasting veggies, and baking salmon. Occasionally I'll roast and/or broil meats. It warms up quickly and is a great alternative to using the full size oven. Makes dinner a breeze, it's easy to clean, and it's durable (we've moved twice and no issues).\n \n  Overall this oven is perfect for me (size, interior specs, controls) EXCEPT, It has the \"top warming\" function which is not of interest nor needed and I worry about my oak cabinets above the oven (10-12 inches away). The biggest issue/concern is the left side of the oven gets very, very hot! The \"warming top\" doesn't even get as hot..  Biggest issue with this is the electrical cord runs next to the left side and that, to me, is a very real FIRE HAZARD! The only thing I've done with this oven is plug in and warm to the \" initial break-in process\" and that\u2019s when I found the issues. What have I done? I just wanted to see if the warming top can be turned off and is there a defect with the side portion. I contacted Breville by email. Received an email in Spanish, they offered an English version, which did not work and my response email would not go through. Trying to contact Amazon, numerous times,  but the # I have is no longer in service (1-888-280-4331). Stuck between a \u201crock and a hard place\u201d. Have had good experience with Amazon in the past but this experience is leaving me stuck with a defective product and no place to turn. Next time I go on line I WILL Not visit Amazon!\n \n  Before I even considered purchasing this appliance I first consulted Consumer Reports. Above all they are the ultimate authority on anything they rate. This oven is in the top five. All pros and no cons.  So if I read a negative review that gives only one star, I consider it to be false, made by someone who just loves to stir up (stuff). ", "\n  Upon first warmup attempt it flashed EO1 error code.  Then the control panel became completely unresponsive.  Would not turn on or do anything.  Unplug, plug back in, no effect. \n  This oven works well.  Easy to use, and toasts and heats well.  The display is clear and easy to follow.  The oven surface does get hot when on.  Be sure to maintain generous separation around it during use, and don't touch it or set things on it that melt or will get picked up bare handed.  The handle is fine, and there are no problems if care is taken.  Very much like a big oven.\n \n  Update 3/19/18.  I'm getting E01 on the screen and you cannot use. I did unplugged and it worked again. \n  It lasted for 3 years. OK, longer than for other folks, but considering with tax this is a glorified $200 toaster, I would expect such small appliances to last longer. I think every appliance these days has an incorporated death timer, so that consumer can buy new ones. After 3 years we got Error05 on this toaster, which is pretty much goodbye. I'll take it to the recycle center. Sort of happy about it and I just bought a DeLonghi replacement , the Breville was rather annoying on a number of issues (too many selections, how many slices of bread, what color, blah blah). Why do they mate a computer with a toaster nowadays? It only spawns trouble. GoodBye Breville, never again.\n \n  This is my third breville oven over 30 years and I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in the small size!  It\u2019s tiny and I am not happy...it cost a fortune to ship to Mexico which precludes returning due to shipping costs!  I haven\u2019t used it yet, but if the reviews are any indication, I\u2019m scre*wed! Damn you breville!  This will be my last purchase from you!  Insult to injury....the ALERT DOES NOT WORK!  I used to love you Breville...for years and highly recommended you...and now you\u2019ve gone cheap China made.  I am saddened and terrifically disappointing in you.\n \n  I actually like a lot of features in this toaster oven quite well but there are 2 negatives that made me downgrade it. First, in assembly the directions should explain that the crumb tray is inserted from the outside with the door closed. Most other toaster ovens have the crumb tray inserted on the inside bottom. Insertion on the Breville is remarkably easy when you know how to do it but the directions could give us a hint. My bigger beef is the timer function. It is not remotely intuitive. If you select pizza and need more than the predetermined time allowed under the pizza option and don't know to adjust the timing knob properly, then your food item will warm, cool down and turn off while you think it is still cooking. This oven is best used in a home environment where someone learns how to use it properly so they are not disappointed. I don't think it is as helpful in a setting with many users who come and go - like an office or dorm. There is a learning curve which you wouldn't really expect in this type of appliance. \n  This middling rating is based entirely on one flaw that is acknowledged by Breville when I called Customer Service/Support.  The toaster produces steam and serious moisture any time I toast bread from the refrigerator.  Breville claims this is normal and due to the moisture in the bread that comes from the refrigerator.  I am here to say this never happened with our two different Cuisinart Toaster Ovens over a 20 plus year period.  The moisture produced in the Breville is significant enough that we use a paper towel midway through the toasting.  We open the door and wipe away all the moisture which is some times sufficient in quantity to drip down the window to the top of the drip pan.  The moisture nearly always is substantial across the top of the oven door. \n  Breville is one of those companies--sadly, fewer and fewer each day--that seems to have hit the perfect balance of price, features and above all, QUALITY. I had a Breville toaster for years; it looked and worked like a champ, flawlessly, for years. \n  So, we had one that lasted almost 8 years, the fuse blew and I changed it 6 months ago, then the board blew. Ok, so let's replace it. I paid 176.00 for the last one in 2011 and now this one was 179.00. The thing arrived dead! It turns on and all, but it won't heat up. I guess I will try another brand.\n \n  Pro: ", "\n  Doesn't have a pop-out rack like the other Breville model (I guess you have to pay a bit more for that), so make sure you have a mitten nearby. Outside of that, it's perfection. My toast is awesome, my chicken is awesome, my pizzas... finally are awesome, I bought this when I moved and I have yet to use my apartment's oven--exactly how I planned. I really like Breville products even if I think they're a bit overpriced because they are stylish. I feel like I'm paying for the design and it's worth it. Ever since I bought my first Breville tea kettle (I bought another for my office!) I've been a fan. If I lived in a bigger place, I'd opt for the larger version, but this is a great space saver.\n \n  I use this toaster oven as my main oven and toaster. So you can imagine my dismay when I discovered the oven never reaches the temperature I set it to. As an example, when I set it at 400 it goes to 350. That really is not close enough. Of course I have learned to set it way high to compensate. Yes, I could send it back but I really need it and my old one is gone. The toast and broil settings are fine. It is large and deep enough for all my cooking. The broiler pan is good and sturdy.\n \n  Died today.After a few episodes of undercooking and temperature non-control I have had enough. Just seven months old. I will try and get some help from Breville but might just buy a Cusinart and forget it.\n \n  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!  What a waste of money.  I bought this almost a year ago and just got the E01 error!  I had a Black & Decker Toaster oven for more than 15 years and never an issue.  WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BREVILLE PRODUCT AGAIN!!!\n \n  I really thought I was going to love it but nope. \n  I'm getting an error code that says to take it to a service center.  On the same day that I received this an error code came up so I unplugged it for 5 minutes then plugged it back in and it worked fine.  The same error came back a couple of weeks later so I unplugged it and plugged in back in and it worked fine.  The error code came up a third time and I did the same to reset the oven.  So far it hasn't happened again.\n \n  We've had good experience with Breville appliances and this is no different in general.  The knobs on Breville products seems to not feel as solid as you would expect at this price point.  The fit of the dials/buttons have a lot of slop in them which for a more premium product wouldn't be expected but is consistent with other Breville products that we own.  As others have noted the heating elements doesn't always toast bread evenly across the entire slice depending on orientation but isn't a big deal.  What is interesting is the amount of condensation/steam that it generates upon use on the glass door. The spring that supports the door is also over sprung resulting slamming of the door if you do not carefully slow it on close.  It's not a huge deal but it's a bit unexpected.\n \n  I LOVE my compact oven! We are living in a kitchenless apartment space temporarily and I cook everything between this oven and my double burner! The reheat setting means we don't need a microwave which I love. It is small enough that it doesn't take up too much space now (it's in the back corner of my picture) and we will be able to keep it out in our next kitchen! My one issue with it is that the door snaps back really hard (caused me to spill my quiche precooking), so it would be nice if the magnetization weren't quite as strong. I've seen the reviews saying after a year it dies but it was the perfect size for what we need right now and I had $40 in Amazon money on my Amazon card so I got a great deal! Also my brother has had his for years so I'm hoping mine will last too because I prefer it to a full sized oven due to it being more energy efficient and heating up so much more quickly. I recommend this oven to everyone.\n \n  I've only had my oven a short time but so far I am very pleased with it. The instructions  that came with it are concise and easy to follow. The oven is beautiful  and has very clean, pleasing lines and color. It operates as it should as far as I can tell and I hope it lasts for years!!\n \n  Finally my toast is reliably even. My wife always wanted a toaster oven. I felt it was overkill, I'd always used pop-up toasters, and we have an oven, so why do we need a toaster oven? Well, its great for quick oven tasks, onion rings are done in minutes, same with oven fries. It looks good, the crumb tray is easy to clean. All the setting make tasks quick and reliably good. We're still exploring all the applications, but I'm glad we finally got one.\n ", "\n  This is designed to make it so very easy to use. \n  We've had this for 5 years and we have been lucky. It has worked fairly consistently. The toasting is not even, but perhaps that is to be expected. \n  After unpacking 3 different boxes to get to the oven and making room for it on my counter, the oven did not work.  I wondered if I was doing something wrong so I called Breville to make sure that I had done everything right.  The rep. was super nice and told me that it was indeed the oven and not me, and told me to return it to Amazon for a quicker replacement.  Within 2 days I had a new oven, and it is super!  Very easy to operate, everything comes out of it just as tasty as can be and I don't have to light my big oven to bake a couple of potatoes.  So far, it does everything I want it to and with ease.\n \n  Within a week got E01 error. Returned to Amazon and got a replacement. Got E01 error again within 2 days. Will be returning this one for refund and going with a different brand. Sadly, reading other reviews, this seems to be a common issue. I'm not wasting another return/ replacement hoping 3rd time is the charm.\n \n  Loved the first one we bought. It lasted forever. It still works (In a friends house) but the glass around one of the heating coils broke and I didn't feel like paying 75$ for the part.  I should have. The newer model is the same in all respects except  you must rotate the knob a lot more to add time to you cook.  What was a flick of the wrist now takes several slow and deliberate turns. Therefore 4.9 stars and not 5!\n \n  I bought this about a month ago and it has virtually replaced my large oven. I use it for everything - pizzas, toast, bagels, frozen foods, cookies, roasting potatoes and everything has come out perfect. Some of the reviews had me nervous, but I'm glad I made the purchase since this is my favorite kitchen appliance and makes a great companion to an Instant Pot for apartment living. The oven preheats incredibly fast and includes audible cues when ready as well as when complete. I have found that the build of it is satisfactory and the functional dials and buttons are laid out well, making it intuitive to those unfamiliar with the product. I loved the oven so much, I gave one to my parents for Christmas. As a single working guy in an urban apartment, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it for anyone considering it.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I have ever had. It makes toast twice as fast and twice as good as any I've owned in the past - the only TO that toasts evenly on both sides. It also heats up quickly and seems to be accurate temperature-wise. I do wonder about the logic of having the preheat ding occur at 75% of the desired temperature however. I think the cook can decide if he/she wants to put something in the oven early. For baked goods temperature is often critical. Normally that wouldn't even be a concern for me, as I have never liked baking desserts etc. in my TOs. The only thing I've tried so far in this one is a pie, and I was very pleased with how it came out. I am also thrilled that the few alerts that the oven sounds are polite little dings - not the loud beeps that used to make me jump and hurt my ears. One of the features I hate the most about the newer ovens. Highly recommend!\n \n  I have done a lengthy market search for the best compact toaster oven. The Breville BOV650XL  came fist with a flying colors. The famous saying \"you get what you paid for\"  is true here too.  It is more expensive than most other same size ovens, but the quality if it is way above the rest of the oven crowds. It fits 12 inch pizzas, it has friendly interface to control all cooking options. It has defaults temperatures and times for all popular foods. It has a useful crumbs tray that can be easily pulled out.  It has the best reviews scores  and less complaints. What else do you need from a compact toaster oven?\n \n  Got this on a recommendation from a friend and positive comments. I should always pay more attention to the bad ones, \n  This product is a real treasure for those looking to save space and yet do all the things that a large traditional oven can do. Actually, it does more than any traditional oven. It's preset cooking cycles are easy to set and also can be adjusted to any time or temperature you want. Reached cooking temperature way faster than a traditional oven. Of course, the trade-off is that it only fits small amounts of food: about 10\" x 11\" x 5\". However, it has 3 rack positions. And, Yes, it gets very hot to touch - but apparently this is a necessity for a toaster oven because every one I researched gets hot enough on the outside to burn your hands. Controls are intuitive; visual and audible signals are pleasing; digital operation is accurate. My only complaint is not about the oven, but about the broil and bake pan set. Embarrasingly CHEAP!. Supposedly porcelain, but warns not dishwasher safe. Comes with factory blemishes from the far-off manufacturing and coating process; made with dangerously sharp rims that can easily slice your flesh. Recommendation: Buy this product, toss out the pans; buy Chicago Metallic mini broil/roast set (10\" x 7\" x 1 3/4\") and another quality 9 to 10\" square bake pan - all for about $25 extra!\n ", "\n  Does not begin to compare to my older model ... smaller in size, hard to read settings they do not light up, rack does not pull out when opening the door ... will not purchase again when this one quits...It is not worth the price.\n \n  I thought that all the extra settings would be overkill, but despite the extra features it\u2019s actually pretty easy to use. I went with this model because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. This replaced a $35 13 year-old Black and Decker toaster oven that stopped working. I found that other low priced models heated food inconsistently so I splurged on one that I could trust to cook food reliably. It works well, though it\u2019s frustrating that I had to hit this price point to get what I needed out of it.\n \n  This is a very nice toaster oven!  It does a great job of maintaining a desired temperature and all the settings for the different uses are fantastic.  It never burns my toast or bagels, and it\u2019s a really great size for most people... the next size up from this one is absolutely cavernous!  My only complaint is that, for a $200 toaster oven, I feel like the plastic dial just feels too cheap... in construction, operation, appearance... all of it.  Surely a stainless dial wouldn\u2019t have added that much to the cost?  It just feels like it wasn\u2019t really built to last.  I love the toaster otherwise, just wish they had gone for a bit nicer dials, to make the customer feel as if they\u2019ve bought a really good toaster oven that was built to last!\n \n  I had an old toaster over for 10 years before this one that I thought worked fine.  I upgraded because this one was not expensive and my other oven looked beat up. I was very surprised to find out that this one gets hot fast! And it certainly gets hot enough to broil. Also, it takes less counter space than my other oven even though the inside is the same size.  I won\u2019t be turning on my oven this summer!\n \n  Several things I didn't like, so I returned it.  No inside light.  Makes terrible toast. Rack doesn't automatically slide out.  Guess what, the Panasonic Flash Mini can do these things in spades.\n \n  My wife and I wanted a compact toaster oven that is simple to use, simple to clean, and that bakes foods in a uniform manner, and makes toasting bread easy. This Breville Compact Toaster Oven does that and more. It has a large glass window that lets you see what's cooking or toasting, easy-to-use digital control knobs, and a nice beep that lets you know when heating has finished. It's lightweight and it looks great on our counter. Costs more than other brands of similar size, but we've had great luck with our other Breville machines, so we stayed loyal to the brand.\n \n  Got this toaster oven a couple years ago.  It never worked right from the get go.  I finally started experimenting with all of the various settings and found that the bottom coils NEVER turned on.  Too late to return the product.  Buyer beware.\n \n  Oven heats fast, toasts just fine.  What I do NOT like about it is it does not pull out the rack when you open the door. you have to use a hotpad or reach into a hot little oven.  Daughter has the next level up, and it does extend the rack with the door.\n \n  I've had bad luck with this model -- reliability is poor. In Nov. 2015, I picked up a Breville BOV650XL Compact Smart Oven Stainless Steel on my sister's enthusiastic recommendation. After ~18 months it began to malfunction. When set on Toast (not Bagel) the bottom heating element wasn't heating, resulting in half toasted toast. To their credit, Breville replace the original unit summarily. But then, ~12 months into the life of the replacement, the same problem: half toasted toast on the Toast setting. Grrr! I've seen complaints about the inputs failing on this unit over at WireCuttter.com. I wonder if it's a selector design flaw, given that the Bagel setting toasts only on the top, by design. Is it possible that the rotator selector was fritzing out, making both Toast and Bagel settings default to the same thing? The bottom heating element was working in other modes. In any event, the Breville is too expensive for this to happen repeatedly.\n \n  When i first bought this Oven, i was thinking it is very pricey and that a toaster oven is a toaster oven... however once i started using it, i realized that this oven is the best \"toaster\" oven i have ever had - i feel like calling it a toaster oven is like calling a woman a man. ", "\n  I bought this oven almost ten years ago.  Stills works great!  I keep it clean, which is a must with these countertop ovens.  Finally replacing the oven trays.  They got a little funky even with regular cleaning.  This looks nice on the counter...streamline look.  It does put out some heat, so open space is better.  Cooks very well and toasts evenly.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven. When I have a good toaster oven, I use it all the time. For the longest time, I kept trying to find a good, cheap toaster, and I was repeatedly disappointed. My dad has had this toaster for years and I love using it every time I'm home. I finally stopped buying other toasters and invested in this toaster--and I'm finally happy with a toaster that is both a good little oven, and great at toasting. My favorite feature is the timer on the toast, so you can see how long it will take. Also, if you want your toast a tad darker (or lighter), it's easy to nudge the time up (or down) while it's toasting without stopping it earlier or restarting the toasting function. Very handy.\n \n  Like it so much, I brought it a second time as a gift because the person was impressed on what it could do when they were at my home multiple times this year. I watch America's Test Kitchen all the time and Breville was always given good remarks, so I wanted to try the lower end version before I splurged. It's been a year and this is our workhorse appliance, especially in the Summertime, as the convention oven gets the space too hot in Texas. You may want to wait until Black Friday for a good deal\n \n  .....and I hope they have upheld the quality, so I checked with Cooks Country.  The latest test claimed the quality is still good.  This one I sent one to my daughter in Hawaii.  I do everything with this oven:  Roast chickens, make croutons, broil hanger steaks, roast vegetables, make pizza, reheat, etc.  I like it better than my full-sized oven for its convenience.\n \n  We love this thing. It uses way less power than the full size oven, and preheats in 4 minutes. My only gripe is that the feel of the time/temp setting knob is not crisp. The clicks are hard to feel and sometimes a click will produce no change, then the next click will change two steps. Doesn't have a precise feel.\n \n  This is perfect for a family of two.  You can put a 6 muffin tin in there, two nice pieces of chicken, and a casserole.  I literally don't use my oven anymore.  This little oven doesn't take up that much space on the counter and it can do everything your oven can, well except for a 13\" pizza stone.  It wouldn't fit and that's why I have to take one star off because that was one of the main reasons why I purchased it.  It said you could do a pizza in it.  I say it's still worth it.  Less clean up and electricity too.\n \n  After my last toaster oven this is great. \n  I bought this for my son and his wife for a housewarming gift.  I chose it because I was given the same one by my step-mom several years ago and loved it.  I use it all the time.  It's a little more expensive than others you can find at Target or Costco, but it's definitely worth the money.  It heats up fast, easy to clean and cooks consistently whether your baking, toasting or broiling.\n \n  I love this little oven.  I've had it about 2 months.  I live alone and cook for one.  It's so much easier to use this toaster oven versus my big oven.  I love the settings for different types of cooking, this is very handy. \n  This mid size Breville toaster oven seems to be very well made. It's easy to use and easy to clean. The exterior casing does get warm after heating up food but quickly returns to normal. I'm not thrilled about the 12\" pizza tray not being included in this hefty price, but will cost an additional $30. It is a fine toaster oven however, and I hope it will last a long time. So far, I highly recommend it. It's a handsome unit and appears to work well.\n ", "\n  Shortly after I bought it, it shwed an error code.  I called Breville which said I ahould unplug it and then plug it in again--probably due to a power surge.  It continued to do it every few weeks with no power surge so Breville since it was still under warranty is replacing.  I would not buy it again, however; to set the time and temperature, you have to keep twirling the button since it defaults to 1 hour and 350 degrees.  Very user unfriendly.\n \n  Toast came out unevenly brown. Not even close to even doneness on front back and top and bottom. \n  We have had a Panasonic toaster oven for years and it started to fail.  I purchased this one as a replacement because it is the #1 toaster oven rated in Consumer Reports ($229 list).  I was a bit skeptical at first if I would like it with the electronic controls.  They are easy to use and the rack position text on the outside glass makes using it a breeze.  We have \"cooked\" frozen chicken patties in it and toasted english muffins.  So far, so good.  The crumb tray is easy to clean.  My only complaint is that the rack does not have a \"stop\" position, so as you are pulling it out, you have to be careful not to pull it out all of the way.  I do recommend this product.\n \n  Received this three days ago and have used to bake two frozen pizzas and make toast thus far. Toast is even and produces a lovely crisp exterior with a soft interior. Heating up for pizza baking is less than a quarter the time the full oven takes and does just as well. A Trader Joe's pizza or California Pizza Kitchen fit perfectly with the recess in the back creating a little extra space beyond the rack itself. \n  After only a few uses, the edge of the glass lid started to emit some white nasty liquid. And when it dries, it's hard to clean.\n \n  I got this for a great price during Black Friday 2019.  Looks great.  Well built.  Cool display and controls.  Too bad I kept getting E1 and E4 errors requiring me to unplug and re-plug the unit.  I don't know if this is normal or not, but it was unacceptable to me.  I returned it.  Amazons rocks when it comes to returns.\n \n  This is my go to oven. It preheats in minutes, the controls are handy and easy to navigate and it is the perfect size for meals for two people. It does not take up a lot of precious counter space and is very well designed. I use it for toast, small stews, 1/2 baked chicken, corn muffins, reheating leftovers and everything else. It is a workhorse and saves cleaning the big wall oven!\n \n  This is the 2nd Breville I\u2019ve bought. The size is perfect for us. I don\u2019t do that much cooking but if I bake it\u2019s in this. You can set the oven temp and it also has an adjustable timer.  The muffins toast perfectly and it holds 4-5 halves. Bigger than the little toaster ovens but sometimes you get what you pay for and this is a plus!\n \n  OK oven, terrible toaster.  Takes two or three cycles to properly toast.  Two years old, suddenly up and died.  Online info shows this a common Breville problem; death of a thermal fuse.  However, replacing the fuse is impossible; the unit cannot be taken apart without destroying it.  Better off with a $40.00 Black and Decker.\n \n  This is a great little oven.  We use it daily for 7 years. I purchased this oven to replace our previous Breville.  The previous breville developed a smell due to some food dripping on the heating elements.  I was unable to clean the elements.\n ", "\n  We bought this as a replacement for a previous model which we had for years.  It is slightly larger (a plus) but the controls and operation were familiar (also a plus).  We had been very happy with its predecessor, but the upper heating element finally wore out and we decided to invest in a new model.  We are very pleased with our decision.\n \n  Easy to use - quick heat up and convenient for our 2 person household. I like how the oven automatically turns off after the re-set timer expires (peace of mind) easy to clean tray. \n  Worked great for a few years. Used only sparingly but failed without any warning.\n \n  My $40 toaster oven died a while back and when I went to look for a new one I looked through all the reviews on Amazon.  This Breville seemed very well reviewed, but I had a really hard time parting with the $160 for it.  I figured I would buy it and if I didn't really love it I'd just return in.  After just a couple of uses, I knew it was home for good.  The design is just excellent - it's really refreshing to find a consumer product that's been thought through so well - it gave me the same satisfied feeling I had when I got an Apple computer - really straightforward and easy to use while also good looking.  I love that the display screen and the numbers on it are large and simple to read.  I've been so happy with mine I bought one for my parents (who had insisted that their cheapie was fine despite their frequently expressed hope for its passing) and they are now sold on it too. \n  This is the most fantastic toaster oven ever. Period. We've had many and they always ended up looking like a wreck after a few months of heavy use. This one still looks brand new and works like a champ. If your on the fence about the price, take the plunge. You won't regret it. \n  Some reviewers have felt the controls are overly complicated.  At first glance, you might think you don't have much flexibility given the \"presets\" for various foods.  In practice, they are just a starting point and adjustments are fairly straightforward.  And as suggested in the manual, you should experiment to see what settings work best for you.  I keep a little notebook nearby to jot down attempted settings.  So far so good.  In terms of energy savings, haven't seen the first electric bill since first use, but have reduced using large oven significantly, probably on the order of 85-90%.  Really  pleased with my purchase.\n \n  Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Breville. My first purchase from Breville was an Ikon Juicer. I followed it up with the 650XL oven (bought one for my parents and my sister ended up getting one too), one of the expresso machines, and most recently the fast slow cooker. \n  I bought this for my mom.  The bottom grates never worked and now it completely stopped working.  Unfortunately it's to late to return it. I purchased it based on my own oven but this one was a total dud.\n \n  Unfortunately I've been forced to return two identical units, both didn't toast bread evenly (top to bottom).  Yes, that's hard to believe considering the cost of the toaster. \n  Makes toast perfectly and much faster than my last toaster oven. While not as fast as a dedicated toaster, on darkness of 4, takes under 3 minutes. The bake feature also works very well. I love those small Tortino pizzas but the full size oven never cooked them well. I follow the bake instructions on the box; I haven't used the pizza option on the toaster. Also works great for TV dinners. ", "\n  I ADORE this sanity saver. Especially now that it's summer and it's HOT HOT HOT. I don't have to heat up my home with my oven because I use my Breville instead. It helps me make dinners faster when I get home late on the weekdays for my son and I AND since it's been so grossly hot here where I live I love that there is minimal heat production from this unit when cooking vs a regular oven. Working moms, and dads, when you are rushing at the end of the day to get a dinner put together for hungry kiddos it's nerve wracking enough. If your home is hot to boot, the last thing you want is to add more heat to it. PLUS, this Breville oven is soo easy to clean. Trust me, I got it very dirty. Like went a month without cleaning it. Had pork grease in there. Bread crumbs. Cookie crumbs, DUST. Lots of yuck. I simply pulled out the tray from the bottom, ran it under hot water and swiped it with a soapy sponge and then took the sponge (less soapy now) to the food rack and the glass door and the outside of the unit. In 2 minutes it was just like new. I was a little shocked. Breville, I pledge my allegiance to you. :)\n \n  door slams shut. Should have a spring to gently close it\n \n  If you're looking for an easy to use oven with ample functions (bake, broil, toast, etc. etc.), this would be the best. The functions to time out how long the oven should bake for is wonderfully convenient and preheats fast. The control over the variables of cooking functions is also nice. The only thing left to be desired is the cosmetic features of this oven- bulky, not easily kept clean, and especially an eyesore at the end of the kitchen counter. Also, the oven door tends to swing back up with some force instead of staying open, which can be quite startling.\n \n  Read the reviews thought I picked a decent product, no did not work at all, returned bought a different oven.\n \n  I like it better than my previous Oster toaster oven.  It's smaller to fit on my counter better.  The controls are very nice.  The count down time is easy to see.  It seems more expensive than other toaster ovens, but it's worth the price in ease-of-use. \n  broke after 8 months.  Got an R1 error that manual says it\u2019s not safe to use.  Company won\u2019t warranty it, won\u2019t reply to emails ina timely manner.  they want us to pay $90 to get it fixed.  Crappy service and crappy toaster.\n \n  Perhaps there's a better toaster oven out there, but in my experience this thing is amazingly accurate.  I hardly ever use my kitchen stove oven anymore.  Must be an electricity savings somewhere here as well as it's so efficient.  Heats up in a flash and stops and cools quickly.  Bakes, broils and toasts really well. Buy it, you won't be disappointed...\n \n  I own a Breville microwave which I have enjoyed for a few years so I trust the brand. This toaster oven has not let me down. I have a shortage of counter space and considered the smaller one but glad I got this one. It looks good and functions well.\n \n  This oven is unsafe! The back, top and side without controls is so hot it burns your skin. It could burn thru the oven electric cord if it should came in contact with the the back of the oven. I'm surprised Amazon would sell such an unsafe item.\n \n  There are some things where a microwave won't do & the oven is just too much. This works well for any open faced sandwich with melted cheese, bagels, pizza. Simple intuitive interface, refined developed design that works very efficiently - a nice toaster oven for the 21st Century.\n ", "\n  Looked great and was a good size, but the upper broil element never turned on so it would never broil anything and had to return it. Returns were easy but very disappointed to have to return it. Thought I would be one of the lucky ones and not have a problem as others who ordered this one. Not worth the risk or headache.\n \n  Functionality wise, this toaster oven covers all the bases you could want and is very affordable. 5/5 Stars \n  A very nice little oven. Easy to use and set. The only downside I can see is that the inside height of the oven is rather low, so it won\u2019t fit a Whole Costco rotisserie chicken for example. Other than that it\u2019s really great and well made. I\u2019ve had it about a month now. I hope it lasts, as there are some issues with long term durability on Breville ovens.\n \n  Love my Breville .... Easy to use ...easy to understand the functions even for my adult kids. One thing...cleaning the tray is a bit of a challenge and was never able to fully clean it. Like after baking cookies on a cookie sheet there is always a burnt mark...well...same here. A sore left over.... But I still love my Breville\n \n  Have owned the 650XL for 9 months now and can recommend it highly -- high quality product and in my opinion well worth the high price.  Everything is robustly built with one exception -- the two knobs on front panel are plastic and a bit flimsy compared to the solid overall construction -- not a problem per se, just inconsistent with the overall quality. \n  It works very well but there are some minor issues that one would not expect from a high end product. Primarily, the stops on the knobs are not synced with the readout on the screen so if I'm changing the toast darkness from 4-6 for example, I generally have to stop between clicks of the dial to get to 6. Doesn't affect use, just a poor detail. Also, it would have been good if the tray came out when you opened the door like some other Breville models do/did using a magnet mounted in the door to pull the tray out when the door was opened.\n \n  We have always had a toaster oven and use it almost every day.  When my old one started having problems I researched and this one got great reviews.  I love it.  Easy to use, lots of temperature controls, large inside capacity and easy to clean.\n \n  Breville makes the BEST kitchen Appliances IMHO \n  Got it and tested it with an oven thermometer!  Set the are temp at 350.  After 45 mins. oven NEVER went above 325!!  Calling Breville ASAP!!  For $179, made in China junk, am VERY disappointed!!  Will see if Breville is true to their word!\n \n  I had a Oster toaster oven for years, you know the kind with the three dials: one for bake/broil/warm/toast, another for \"temperature\" and the third functioned as a sort of timer (tick-tick-tick-tick-DING!).  It was getting pretty messy, and it was not performing the way that it used to.  Most recently, it refused to cook a small tray of cornbread for chili and I guess that was the last straw.  Yes, cornbread is that important.  So began the search.  I chanced upon the Breville toaster oven, and it was well over our maximum allotment for a toaster oven.  I read the reviews and after talking it over with the spouse we took the plunge. ", "\n  Great overall oven, yes think of it as truly a small oven.  Cooks exceptional for what i have done so far.  I purchased to replace a standard toaster oven but this far exceeds that.  Settings are nice options and has reliable heating.  I was questioning if i wanted to spend the money but i am very satisfied and recommend this highly.\n \n  I have bought 2 of this oven, and only last for a year. I will never recommend it again.\n \n  We\u2019ve had this for about 4 months now and love it! We mostly use the bake and reheat functions, but I love the easy to use dials and buttons. Super easy to clean and cooks really well. But if you put food in before it\u2019s done preheating, make sure you adjust your time because it started cooking! It cooks so fast! Love the size; it fits nicely on my counter under my cabinets but is huge on the inside. Thrilled with this purchase!\n \n  Sent back. This oven wasn\u2019t able to brown the undersides of food, such as pizza. My husband was very unhappy. We returned for a Krups brand and we are extremely pleased.\n \n  Loved it at first, but 3 days later got an error code. Returned the oven for a replacement that had the same problem! Did the low, low pre-Christmas price apply only to defective ovens? If so, very bad policy. I'm using my refund to buy another brand at a different retailer.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I have ever had, by far. It works like a dream, easy controls, reheats and bakes to perfection. I cook on a vintage Chambers stove from 1950, which I love, but the oven is always off by 25 - 50 degrees, so I tend to use only the stovetop. This little electric oven is absolutely precise, and greatly improves my baking experience. So now I am baking muffins, fish, and little pizzas. Have not made toast in it yet, since I have a pop up toaster, but if I have a number of people for breakfast, I will make multiple \"toasts\" and I bet it will do the job.\n \n  Wanted to use my full-size oven less to save money and also wanted to be able to warm leftovers more evenly than in a microwave.  I only cook for myself or one other person  so did not need a huge oven most of the time.  What a surprise this Breville is.  It toasts anything no matter what the size and does it perfectly.  Not quite brown enough?  Pop it back it for another minute.  Need to cook a piece of fish?  Season it and time it perfectly.  I don't know why I waited so long.  After years of barely toasted with the Black and Decker and the uneven toast from the low=end Cuisinart toaster, I have a great appliance that does so many things well.  It is worth the money.\n \n  When my last Cuisinart convection toaster oven died I thought it had been pretty good. But after getting this Breville, i realize this one is so much better, money well spent.  The ability to change temperatures in settings and Compact size and racks adjustment, and cleaning is all so superior.\n \n  At first we wanted to order the same one that we had been using for a long time but it wasn't available. We worried that this one might not be big enough....... well, it is and it has better features and we like it much better than the old one. We are glad we tried it.\n \n  Unfortunately, the cooking trays came damaged. I'm hoping Breville makes it right and replaces the trays. Othen than that it is a great toaster oven. ", "\n  I love this compact smart oven. This is the first Breville item I have purchased, and am now a fan. It\u2019s roasts vegetables to perfection. Used it to bake frozen items, tile pizza rolls, chicken nuggets and mini corn dogs for my kids. They are always evenly cooked and crispy.  This oven is easy to use, and clean. Haven\u2019t broiled any foods or baked cookies or cakes as of yet, but plan to do so in the near future. This was the best item I bought on cyber Monday!\n \n  Our last one lasted seven years. Got it as a wedding gift. Seven year itch? Luckily we\u2019re still happily wed. ;) We used this multiple times every day. So when it just stopped getting power one day we did a little research and opted to get another one. I would have given 5 stars if it lasted longer. I think 10 years seems reasonable.\n \n  I was struggling with the cost but based on the reviews and how unhappy I was with my 4 year old Oster less expensive toaster oven I decided it might be worth the cost.  I am so impressed!  Toast and pizza crispy on the outside but nice and chewy on the inside.  The company warns how \"hot\" the oven gets on the outside.  Hardly!  My Oster used to pretty much glow red when heated up.  I can only hope this is the last toaster oven I need to buy!\n \n  I had purchased this same oven 4 years ago and even though I thought it should last longer, have to say that I used this almost every day.  Mostly for toasting various types of breads, biscuits, baking frozen pies, the occasional Cornish game hens, and reheating some foods I did not want to nuke.  So when it expired, I knew I wanted another Breville and was glad that the exact model was still available.  I read from another poster that his lasted 4 1/2 years so I am expecting the same approximate life span for my new purchase.  I had looked at the Breville BOV800XL, but decided to stay with the model I had previously as it had what I needed.  I also felt it was a little more pricey than I wanted to pay.  Overall I recommend it highly and since I have purchased two, that should seal the deal.\n \n  ADDENDUM: I now have used this product for 2 years and am just as pleased with it as the day I purchased it. \n  If you are going to purchase a toaster over this is the ONLY one you should buy!!!  I have had numerous toaster ovens over the years and this is by far the best and worth every penny!!  I use it almost daily.  Makes great toast, bakes dinner, small homemade pizza, dinner rolls etc etc. Super nice for roasting dinner in the summer because it doesn't heat up the kitchen.  It doesn't do a great job baking bread (even quick breads) because it is just too small.  But my regular oven needs to get used once in awhile.\n \n  I am very pleased with my Breville toaster oven every time I use it. Toast, bagels, rewarming and cooking. Looks great and very easy to use.\n \n  Stop your frustration level, burn marks on your hands, and substandard results.  Toss out those one function toasters, broilers, and counter top ovens. \n  Purchased on Amazon in 2011, it is now 2020. Use this multi-function cooker a few times a day: toasting, grilling, reheating, roasting.\n \n  We recently moved into a newly upgraded kitchen and this appliance has gotten the most use by far. ", "\n  The Breville BOV650XL is a quality toaster oven at a decent price.  Solid aluminum/glass construction with an attractive presentation while sitting on your countertop.  The dimensions are spacious enough to heat a roast or medium size pizza while making easier to clean.  The included broiling rack is firmer and sturdier than racks in other toaster ovens I looked at.  The enamel baking pan has the same sturdy quality as the broiling rack and is also slightly deeper than other pans.  The ability to remove the crumb tray without opening the glass door is a nice touch. \n  Poor product design. The back has no heat protectant so if anything brushes against it (the cord for example!) when the oven is on, it will melt. The back also sticks out prominently so this is almost impossible to avoid.\n \n  I actually use it more than my Whirlpool regular wall ove (which is awful) and it cooks EVERYTHING perfectly. It heats up so fast and really cooks evenly and on point. I wish there was a slightly larger pan. The square one that comes with it still has space on the sides and a larger rectangular could fit but I was not able to find one. I would totally recommend it!\n \n  I researched this extensively. I am becoming a real Breville fan. This is a great oven, fits my counter (I have a small kitchen) and is well designed. Its design is very intuitive and the quality is excellent. Not sure I could be happier. It works well, works very quietly, it has some nice features (like a warming tray feature on top). Others have mentioned the loud notification when it is finished. I guess they may have updated that, as others have mention because, for me, it is just right. Not loud at all, but not too quiet. It makes all kinds of things well \u2013 obviously not just toast (but it does a great job with that) and heats everything consistently with a lot of optionality. It really opened up my capability in the kitchen.\n \n  I recently moved to a rental house that didn't have a built-in microwave like my previous house did. I do not own my own microwave. I picked this toaster oven up as a replacement for a microwave and so far, it has been the best thing I have purchased for my kitchen in a long time! I use it more than the conventional oven for baking and re-heating food. I have used it to bake meatloafs, cookies, pizzas, and of course toast/bagels/muffins, to name just a few things. I do not miss my microwave with this toaster oven on my counter!\n \n  I purchased the Breville almost 2 months ago. I wanted to give it a good workout before writing my review. It is the GOLD STANDARD! I have tried all functions several times and it excels in everything. I was concerned about the interior space, as my now retired smart oven was large enough for almost everything. I kept the trays from that oven. They are wider than the trays included in the Breville. It accommodated them perfectly, allowing me to bake and broil almost everything, without hassling with my oven. I appreciate the quality of  construction of the Breville . The timing function is great and does not need re-setting for each use.\n \n  How did I EVER live without this? We use it for literally everything. My husband is a psychotic toast critic. I make most of our bread and the moist ciabatta that we favor is impossible to toast to the darkness he likes without incinerating the crust and stinking the house up for hours (burnt toast smell lingers, doesn't it?) Anyway, this thing does an amazing job -- not to mention roasting veggies at high heat, broiling sandwiches. AND LET'S NOT FORGET PIZZA! This oven makes the best frozen pizza. Just make sure you get the size that accommodates the pizzas you like to buy. I also ordered a pizza pan and use it for broiling sandwiches.\n \n  Received the toaster end of March in advance for a gift. Box was just opened and the interior tray was dented which means it was previously opened and repackaged. More significant is that the unit does not work. DOA. Dead on arrival.  Followed startup directions exactly and coils never heat up.  Way too expensive of a toaster for this to occur.\n \n  I adore my Breville. \n  I've been using the oven for months.  I had an error pop up so I called Breville customer service.  They were very nice and knew what the code was right away.  Turns out it was because there wasn't enough power, might be an outlet problem.  They recorded the incident in case it happened again.  It has not.  I'm very happy with the oven.\n ", "\n  Bought one, would not toast both sides of the bread evenly. Returned it as defective. The replacement did the same thing. Some users say set to toast setting 6 and it works.  Not true in our case. At five top was toasted, bottom was raw. At 6 top was very dark and bottom was toasted but much lighter. I will use this unit for a couple more weeks using other settings and then decide if I want to keep it or not.\n \n  We've purchased 3 of these ovens over 3 years: We have 1 at home and 1 at work.  These machines get used everyday multiple times per day so I feel we've got our $$$ worth.  It toasts evenly, bakes at the correct temperature and doesn't heat up the whole house.  Yes, the wording does wear off but fortunately we can still see the functions on the digital display.  We will be purchasing yet again when our current ovens eventually die-their just that good.\n \n  Space is an issue for me so this oven was perfect. I've used it many time over the last 2 weeks. I used the bake ,broil, roast and toast function. Baked a sweet potato and I broiled a piece of salmon skin side up not in the broil tray. I used the baking pan as I wanted the skin crispy and the flesh to bake in it's own fat. Worked perfectly. Very happy with this oven. I would defiantly recommend oven.\n \n  Once you master the unusual temperature/timing function, this toaster oven bakes and toasts well with even heat.  Fits well in limited space, has 3 rack positions, an easily removed crumb catcher, and a door that allows easy pan removal.  Automatically turns off after set time is reached.  All temp. and time choices and monitoring are digital and without any printed dial indications which is very confusing until you learn the digital display system.\n \n  My old GE toaster oven failed a few years ago and I bought the best toaster oven I could find in Target. It was $40.  Like all of the other's I saw the timer was cheaply made and very hard to precisely adjust.  This means either un-toasted bread or charcoal could easily be obtained.  How could they call that a toaster.  It was a bread burner!  I just had to get something better and get rid of that one.  Then I found the Breville Compact Smart Oven on Amazon. \n  I like the compact design. I really like having an oven that can bake/roast, make toast and melt cheese on bread slices. I find this oven to be very simple to use.\n \n  Used for 8 months and the ac plug melted and became unusable. Tried to contact Breville and they do not answer phones and will not take message. Filled out online form and have gotten no response. I purchased another brand for replacement. \n  Looks great, high quality, certainly no problems with heating, but a couple of things make me wish I'd gone with something a little smaller and cheaper.  (1) sure it makes great toast, but it's not anywhere near as fast as my toaster.  In the morning I want to be able to pop in bread and have toast in a couple of minutes, the not-so-small oven has to heat up before you can start toasting; it takes a while (2) I have a hard time figuring the 'smart' settings and when the oven is heating, ready to cook, or turned itself off (smartly).  I really want to be able to pick a temperature, set a timer, and away you go.  If you're looking for a small oven, this is great,but if you're looking for a 'toaster oven' it may be more than you need.\n \n  Breville the Compact Smart Oven, Countertop Electric Toaster Oven BOV650XL \n  I researched toaster ovens for several days before I decided to buy this one. The deciding factor was the many reviews I read about the Breville. In the few months we've had it, we've baked garlic bread to perfection, reheated pizza, reheated leftovers and cooked toaster strudel. When reheating the pizza, I found that it heats the pizza through within two minutes. Any longer than that and the pizza would be too hot and crispy for me. My boys love to have toaster strudel for breakfast and commented that it took twice as long to cook it in the toaster than in the Breville. They love this appliance and have used it more often than I have. ", "\n  Bought the Breville model 650 based on top review by \"Cook's Illustrated\", after throwing out a fairly new Black and Decker, which never toasted bread, just petrified it. Loved it from the first. Attractive, solidly built, easy to clean, versatile. I have no issue with the rack that doesn't pop out by itself, never had one that did. Only negatives are the size (even this smaller unit is large for most counters), and price. Purchased from Amazon warehouse, and got what looks like a new unit in original packaging. Liked it so well bought a second one in a smaller size (William Sonoma exclusive) for another location. Toasts wonderfully, handles all cooking I would ever use it for. This model is not convection, not an issue. Highly recommended! Breville BOV650XL Compact 4-Slice Smart Oven with Element IQ \n  This little oven is as smart as advertised. It is compact and I love the pre-set buttons that make it so easy to use. When the preset temperatures or cooking time need changing it is very easy to do via the temp/time button.  I love it.\n \n  I was hesitant about spending the money for this unit but now having for a year I think it is worth it. Quality of construction is solid and the advanced features with an easy to use interface make this a great choice. Mostly used for toast and re-warming left-overs. The toast settings are accurate and it holds temperature when warming. It does get hot especially in the back, so do not place to close to anything.\n \n  So far very easy to use.  Toasts perfectly.  Makes great grilled cheese.  Broiler steaks well.  Only comes with a broiler but not a baking pan.  Suggest ordering. The 12\u201d Pizza pan.  It works very well for all around baking The oven is unique in that it can take a 12\u201d circular pan but only a 10\u201d by 12\u201d rectangular pan.  Breville does not make the latter themselves.\n \n  This is an expensive toaster oven. I purchased it primarily for toasting, but I wanted to use it for baking small things, too. I sent the first oven back to the manufacturer because it did not toast evenly. By that I mean that the top of the toast browned, but the bottom didn't brown hardly at all. Breville kindly replaced it for free after asking for pictures of both sides of bread toasted at various heat settings. The second oven is not much of an improvement. I am really disappointed, because I purchased the larger Breville toaster oven for my daughter less than a year ago, and she loves hers and has no problem with uneven toasting. This has been very frustrating. My husband is ill; I am a full time caregiver, and I don't have a lot of time for hassling with manufacturers.\n \n  Breville is top-notch. I loved their juicer so I already trusted the brand. After researching several toaster ovens (and having owned 3 other more commonly purchased, cheaper brands before), I settled on the Breville despite its higher price because it's really worth the money. It toasts every kind of bread perfectly and in a jiffy, including frozen items, and I've baked perfect cakes and cookies in it every time. I actually prefer it any day over my full-size oven. It's not only saves energy because of its smaller size and it also provides better temperature and cooking control (I also like that I can see the food more closely than in a regular oven). It clean it at least once a week or two and it cleans much more easily than my previous toaster ovens did. And the steel frame and insides make this toaster oven so much more sophisticated looking than the other cheaper brands.\n \n  Most even heating I've experienced with a toaster oven. I've baked pizza and lasagna both turned out excellent. Needless to say I'm very pleased with this oven.\n \n  I purchased this oven on Prime Day and it has not disappointed.  It has numerous settings and a warming feature.  It's big enough for most cooking for a smaller family.  So far so good for this purchase.\n \n  I have to admit that I was leery of paying this amount for a toaster oven.  I had a really nice Panasonic model before this one, and I felt like it would be hard to get twice (or more) benefits out of a toaster oven that was more than twice as expensive as other models.  I looked at all three sizes of this toaster before opting for the middle sized version.  When it first came out of the box, I was shocked at how small this one is.  I could not believe that there is a smaller version than this.  Unless you live in a VERY tiny apartment with limited space, I would definitely not go smaller than this model.  That said, I have absolutely loved this toaster.  It really is worth every penny.  It is small, but it packs a big punch.  Also, I have not been restricted in anything that I have needed to use it for based on its small size.  I have cooked pizza, multiple bagels/toast, etc. in here with plenty of room.  This toaster also cooks better than any over I have ever owned.  It truly does everything it claims it can.  I have never had a more perfectly toasted bagel in my house.  I only have one small complaint that people with limited space should be aware of - this toaster has a HUGE plug on the back that makes it stick straight out around 5\" from the wall.  If you only have one plug for this toaster and you were hoping to sit the toaster in front of this outlet, it really won't work.  Your toaster would be sitting a good 7\"+ inches from the wall, so basically all the way out on your counter.  I had to plug it in down the way from the toaster to be able to push the toaster back to a reasonable position.  It is definitely ugly on the counter to have a large black power cord running along your counter with a giant plug sticking out of the outlet.  I have tried to hide it by putting other things (knife set and utensil holder) in front of it to try and hide it as much as possible.  I know this sounds petty, but it should actually be a consideration if you like a nice and neat countertop.  Utility wise, I really do love this toaster and would highly recommend it - ugly, cumbersome plug and all.\n \n  This oven is a nice compact size but the top gets blazing hot.\n ", "\n  The oven is prefect for my limited countertop space.  It\u2019s easy to use and has quite a number of features for such a compact oven.\n \n  Nice quality. Easy to clean. Door slams shut loudly. Must remember to push on button twice.\n \n  We loved this Breville oven. We really never had a problem with it until it just quit after 2 years and a few months. I would expect that from the cheap ovens, but our last $50 oven lasted 5 years. So I emailed and received an immediate response, which was nice, however their offer was for us to pay $99 to send it in and have it fixed or to get 40% off new oven. I am sorry but for the price you pay for the name I think they could have come up with something a little better than that. We declined. While we do miss it, I will be hard pressed to buy another not knowing how long it will last for the $$.\n \n  I researched toaster ovens for quite some time and found a few that met my requirements. I did not want a convection capability because it was just something else to break. I was also space constrained by the location on our kitchen counter where we place the toaster oven. You get a lot of Toaster oven in a small space, check out the dimensions. Previously we had a DeLonghi unit for about 15 years and it was great. For the longest time I wanted to purchase a new one to match our other appliances and my wife thought that one was just fine; I had to wait until she thought there might be a problem. \n  I read many reviews and visited several websites before I finally decided on the Breville toaster oven.  In the past, I have purchased cheap ovens.  This time I decided to purchase a quality oven and am so glad that I did.  This oven is very accurate with the settings.  I have used the oven for cooking frozen bread, warming up leftovers, pizza, toast, etc.  Everything always turns out well.  The oven is easy to keep clean too.  I use Reynold's non-stick wrap on the baking pan to keep the pan new.  I haven't had any issues with burning myself on the door like others have mentioned.  The handle sticks pretty far out from the door so it hasn't been an issue for me.  Overall, this was a smart decision and I couldn't be happier with my toaster oven!\n \n  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for the \"house\". We already had a toaster oven, but it was smaller and not of the best quality. I saw this unit on Amazon and read many reviews. Most really seemed to like it. I had one specific purpose for this toaster oven and that was to cook a frozen pizza. Our \"Big Oven\" uses tons of electricity and takes about 13 minutes to preheat to 350 deg F. This Breville Compact smart oven preheats to 350 in about 1/3 the time. Nice. \n  Broken within a week. Heats up for about 3 minutes then just stops. Literally have tried it 3 times, on 3 different outlets. Trash. To bulky to bring back to ship. Waste of time and money.\n \n  I purchased this to replace a larger toaster oven. It has taken us some time to get used to the smaller size. However, it is well worth it. \n  Due to the  size and wattage of this oven I am able to bake meals in it instead of my large oven that heats up the house.  It's easy to use and had unexpected features.\n \n  We have used it for baking cookies, heating up pizza, and warming left overs.  It seems to reach temperature quickly and doesn't heat up the house like the full size oven does.  So far, we are very satisfied with it's performance.  I built a stand that fits over the top of our microwave so it doesn't eat up more space on the counter.\n ", "\n  Its pricey when compared to something at Target, but its high quality and you can rely on the temperatures.\n \n  Over the years, I have tried all the Toaster Ovens from $20 - $80.  Every brand imaginable.  I could never find one that performed up to my standards.  Never really felt I got my monies worth.  So I splurged and went for something I never thought I could spend this much for.  However, if happiness has it's price, then this is it.  It does everything I could ask for, and then some.  It makes PERFECT toast, and English muffins.  It bakes a great 12\" pizza, and the reheat function is very easy, and simple enough for this single guy could ever want.  I'm glad I finally spent the extra money and found something worth spending it on.  I have had it for three months now, and no issues what so ever.\n \n  While this oven is a top performer in many ways, after buying it, I learned that 1) the enamel baking pan and broiler pan that come with it are *not* dishwasher safe, and 2) when the baking is done, the oven gives three bashful little chirps that are not loud enough to get my attention.  Other than that, it works very well.\n \n  I really like the size, looks and the way the Breville is built.  I have only had it for 3 days but so far it cooks really well and there is always a learning curve with any product.  I bought this because I am alone and hate to cut on my big oven just for 1 person.  I read all the reviews before purchasing as this was a considerable amount of money for a Toaster Oven.  For those reviews that didn't like the rack because things slide off, just turn the rack over that will keep items from sliding, and the complaints about the heat, wear a mitt when removing any item out of the oven.  Also I would like to add that this was ordered from Amazon late Tuesday night and I received it on Thursday by 3:30 pm.  If I change my mind about this oven I will update at a later date but so far I am very pleased.\n \n  Compact oven is our 2nd edition. From first edition in 2011, it didn't change much since 2011. The first purchase in 2011 still functions great and lasts forever. The oven crumb tray has some caramelized meat fat and some that's not coming off so we might have to order the bottom tray replacement if that is offered from manufacturer. I bake small batch of cookies, cakes, and bread, and personal pan pizza. I bake fish, chicken, mac n cheese, and lots of other recipe. I only bake turkey in the big oven and pizza that doesn't fit this Breville Oven. Otherwise, I am very satisfied so far.\n \n  Love this oven.  It cooks better than my big oven for things like pizza, fish sticks, and cookies.  We use it much more frequently than the big wall oven.\n \n  The oven works well but has a major safety flaw. Since the material other than the front panel is all metal it gets boiling hot which is a hazard. It is very easy to burn yourself if you touch any part of the toaster/oven other than the handle while it is turned on. We just bought this oven and so far, the cooking experience has been positive but I am concerned about potential burns.\n \n  I have now owned this for three years and it is still working to my expectations.  Though I feel purchasing the cutting board that goes on top imperative.  It gets super hot and I feel better having the cutting board up there.  I have owned many toaster ovens and this one is far above better performing (you really can cook and bake with it) and long lasting.\n \n  This got high marks by Consumer Reports and Amazon. For $200, expected better quality out of the box. Deal breaker was when crumb tray did not fit. Had to return during covid-19. Much to my amazement, Amazon came through remarkably well. Thought I was going to take a loss.\n \n  Definitely not worth the price. I have recently seen this exact product manufactured by a different company in Costco. It was less than half the price. My cheap Toaster oven at the office is much better quality. Very disappointed.\n ", "\n  When I read the rave reviews by others, I thought they probably needed to get a life, but this was before I got my Breville toaster oven.  Indeed, I too love this oven.  I'm a technical writer, so the first thing I did was look at the user manual - it is excellent, and the troubleshooting section clearly answers the oven temperature calibration questions noted by some reviewers.  The toast is perfect, as are cookies and everything else I've baked in this beautifully designed little oven.  I have taken a picture of the trademarked plug and enjoy showing it to my mechanical engineer friends.  Who knew a plug could be so user-friendly! You get what you pay for, and in this case, I'm certainly glad I spent the money - this oven is worth every penny.\n \n  Loved the item but it has glass tube for heating elements and glass is easy to break.  Got Cuisinart to replace it\n \n  I bought this item for my best friend as her wedding gift and she just tried to use it today and it doesn't heat up at all. Of course the return window is closed too - this will be my first and last purchase of a Breville Product.\n \n  Doesn't toast evenly and using the other settings, food doesn't seem to come out as it should.  Not worth the money, do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  My return window has closed so it seems there's nothing I can do.\n \n  Toasts and bakes very evenly.  The thing I thought was really cool is that it adjust toasting times based on if it is warm and just made a batch of toast.  This prevents it from make the second and third batches in a row darker.  Very nice.  Exceeded my expectations and looks great on the counter!\n \n  I live in a one bedroom \u201cvintage\u201d chicago apartment with a very old oven. I bought this basically to use instead of my crappy old oven. I love it. I make everything in this appliance. It\u2019s way more than a toaster oven. It\u2019s great if you\u2019re cooking for just yourself, heating up leftovers, making toast, roasting vegetables, baking- it does it all. It\u2019s very easy to use, heats up incredibly fast, and takes up less space than a microwave. Very high quality, I see this lasting me for a long time.\n \n  Attractive and built strong. I bought my mother a less expensive little oven and she compared it to a tin can, so I bought this one and we are both happier. It is surprisingly large and it is easy to operate\n \n  Cooking for myself, this Toaster Oven is the ONLY oven I use in my house, unless I'm having company, in which case this is a great second oven. Intuitive and accurate controls. A bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. Biggest decision is what size to get. I find the smaller one, which is as big as any other Toaster Oven is more than adequate. But if you're a frozen pizza lover, then you may want to consider the larger oven. But keep in mind the larger Toaster Oven takes up valuable counter space. I have had no issues with this oven whatsoever. Three rack heights, digital read out for time and temp. It's a breeze to use. The name Breville now means quality to me.\n \n  This is my first toaster oven, so I can't offer comparisons to others, but this made me a believer in toaster ovens!  I love being able to bake a potato without heating up the whole house and running up my power bill.  I hardly use my oven at all any more.  It makes great little pizzas (I build my own using Naan bread) and the broiler works perfectly for hot dogs that almost taste like they were grilled. I've also used it to bake cookies (it just requires more small batches due to the oven size).  Easy clean up, easy to use and looks good too!  I wish the top rack would automatically pull out when opening the door like it does on the full size version, but it's a minor issue.  I considered the full size, but for a small kitchen the compact is just right.\n \n  Everything about it is superior to any other toaster oven I've had in the past. Really easy to clean. Low profile. Digital display is great and intuitive. Knobs have a pleasing feel when changing settings. Handle is nice and big for grabbing quickly - like when your tortilla is about to burn.\n ", "\n  So quiet, that sitting 10 ft away you might not hear it's \"ready\" after pre-heat in if you aren't in the same room. Or muffled out by sound of a refrigerator, etc. \n  I researched toaster ovens for months before finally deciding to bite the bullet and cough up for this model.  (Second place was the ~$35 B&D.)  It hurt to part with so much money, but I am glad I did. \n  Awful did not heat a slice of pizza 1/2 hr\n \n  Do not buy. Ordered in December 2016. It recently stopped working (won\u2019t heat up). For the amount of money I paid I couldn\u2019t be more disappointed that it would stop working so quickly. We probably used the oven once every other day as we have several appliances we use based on the need. I repeat, do not buy.\n \n  The oven works great. It should be cleaned each time used if there is any splatter. Overall a great product.\n \n  This is, quite simply, the best toaster oven I've ever owned.  My wife and both love it.  It works great, looks great, and feels solid.  Yes, it's a lot more expensive than a traditional Black & Decker style toaster over, but it's worth it in my opinion.  I've owned it for a few months now and we are still talking about how much better it is than any other toaster over we've owned.  Just look at the reviews vs. other models.  It's a good size unit with a large capacity, toasts evenly, and has digital setting for the number of slices and the level of darkness.  We haven't used it for broiling or baking yet, but based on how it toasts I'm expecting it work perfectly.  Bottom line: if you can afford it, this is the best toaster oven you can buy.\n \n  LED lit, but elements don't heat. Contacted manufacturer and my call was not returned.  Too late for google return. \n  Only giving 4 stars as we've only owned this a month and cannot truly attest to it's durability. So far our entire family loves this unit.  We're cooking all of our frozen pizzas, roasts, potato puffs, english muffins,  toast etc.  So easy to brush crumbs out of the pull out drawer.  We are certainly saving on electric bill as we've barely used our full size oven since we got it.\n \n  Much fancier than I'd have bought ordinarily, but Consumer Reports recommends it highly, and it was on sale.  Haven't roasted a chicken in it yet, but you can.\n \n  After 4 years of use, I am convinced this is a high quality product.  It is the best toaster oven I have owned over 50 years.  It makes perfect toast, bagels, and broiled chicken and fish, which are my typical uses.  Other family members bake in it.  It is pleasant to see in the kitchen because its case is slick looking for a toaster oven.  We have used it morning, noon and night, so its been durable for us.  Every part is of high quality, and it's a compact unit.  The controls are simple to master and operate flawlessly.  I know exactly what my toast is going to look like when its done.  The upper side is evenly toasted and the lower side has the grill pattern on it.  The toast is heated through but never burned.  I like that I can easily see it toasting and enjoy seeing the elements glowing.  My fish is now perfect and I far prefer to use this as a broiler than to use the stove broiler because it requires less attending.  The broiler pan is well made and has sufficient room for plenty of meat or fish. Its easy to clean.  Although its more expensive than some others, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.\n ", "\n  I love my Breville toaster oven!  It definitely cuts down on the time and energy when compared to using the oven.  It's small enough to fit in the counter of my kitchen counter but did enough to get the job down.  I've only had the oven for almost a month and haven't had any problems but I will keep you posted if anything goes wrong which I doubt.  The oven was packed very well.  It came in 3 sets of boxes so it took me a little while to unpack it but well worth the work!  I recommend this product!\n \n  Awesome oven we use 3-4 times a week for a ton of meals. Has enough room to fit a small pan of cookies, or a pan with 2 chicken breasts or a pan with 2 tilapia fillets. Way faster to preheat than our large conventional oven. Works out for toast, just be careful as the toast can burn easily with how much power this little guy puts out.\n \n  Breville is right to call this a Smart Oven rather than a toaster oven. In a nutshell, you use the middle dial to choose what it is you're cooking and the bottom dial to instruct the oven how you expect it to come out, and it does the rest. It is very handsome looking in our kitchen and easy to use and keep clean. Toast comes out perfect, and the \"frozen\" button adds just the right amount of time to reheat a frozen bagel or waffle. It's not deep enough to do more than a slice or two of pizza, or maybe some appetizers, so you'll need to consider a larger oven if that's your goal. One very neat feature is that the top servers as a plate warmer, allowing me to keep items warm without having to put them into an oven. \n  It may sound crazy, but this toaster oven was life changing for me!!!! My previous Black n Decker had a horrible dial for darkness Alex ion and we constantly over or under toasted and we\u2019re always stressed hovering over the toaster to cook just right. But THIS Breville Toaster is so accurate and perfect - it stops toasting when it\u2019s done and it\u2019s so quiet - we just LOVE it!! I highly recommend.\n \n  We love this toaster oven. heats more even than our old toaster. more efficient than heating up the big oven. Love the look, easy function, screen shows what the settings are. NICE!\n \n  A week prior to purchasing this toaster our sturdy little 10 yr old Black&Decker toaster oven started tripping the GFI and sending sparks out of the outlet. As I flung the B&D out the window, I assumed I could replace it with the same unit, but a newer version. No luck. The B&D styling was awful and the reviews worse. So began the research into a new make of toaster. I like a small footprint, intuitive functionality and generally smart design in my appliances. Ultimately, what I hoped came closest was this Breville. I was hung up on price for a while, easily $100 more than I wanted to spend. The Breville was larger than the B&D in depth and height. I wasn't thrilled about that, but as it turns out it doesn't feel overly large. The controls are simple to use and adjust. \n  Excellent product. This device was made in Australia; honestly didn't know Australians can make quality products like this. Works as expected and very similar to an actual oven, so you can use the same time and temperature as you would when using a large oven. Love the frozen Pizza setting because I don't have to do anything except press start. I do recommend leaving the grill on the lower tier for all cooking needs, including pizzas. It won't cook evenly on the middle or top tier. Lower tier works for almost everything.\n \n  We've been very pleased with this toaster oven. It is small, yet I can cook a loaf of bread or pan of brownies in it.  Different settings, easy to use.  It is nice to set the bake cycle for a specified amount of time to avoid burning.\n \n  Not useful as a toaster - bread toasts mostly on one side.  Ok if you watch it and flip the bread over halfway through.  Good for heating up frozen items.\n \n  I love this toaster.  When we moved, we decided to replace our Black and Decker with a new toaster oven (it still worked, but didn't match our new kitchen).  So naturally, we bought another Black and Decker, since we had good luck with it.  Unfortunately, that one only lasted a few months.  Thinking it was a fluke, we got another, and that one burned everything, and then gave out.  So then we tried another brand, which also burned everything and smoked.  So I decided to go online and research, and found this oven had good reviews.  I balked at the price, but we figured we'd already spent more than that replacing toaster ovens every 3 months.  You definitely get what you pay for.  This toaster oven is great.  I have tried most of the different settings (bake, toast, pizza, frozen), and it cooks everything perfectly.  I have probably made up the cost by not having to throw away burnt food.  I love the larger size - I can fit two slices of pizza at once.  I like the crumb tray that slides out in the front and is easy to clean.  It does get kind of hot while in use, but just don't touch it while it is in use!  It's not a big issue.  I would highly recommend this toaster oven.\n ", "\n  This little oven has overtaken my big gas stove for frequency of use. I live alone and don't make big meals, so all I need is this unit. It cooks extremely well. In fact, I no longer use my pop-up toaster, since this baby does the trick. In addition, it's simple to use and easy to clean. Highly recommended. I only wish I had room for the larger model, since a large pizza can't fit into this, although one could be cut in half and the two halves heated separately.\n \n  A very decent toaster oven but does nothing a Black & Decker can't do for half the price.  And guess what, this oven has no internal light so good luck keeping an eye on your food!!\n \n  Love- Love my Breville compact \"Smart\" Toaster Oven!!!  Its the best toaster oven around & worth paying more for! It also has a good look about it!  It works faster & better than any toaster oven i have ever had. I've had this since December 2010!  If I had a choice/not look crazy-- I would buy the bigger one for another counter!! It is possible the big one-may not toast as fast! I went back & forth with my decision & finally purchased the compact one!!!! I always make sure there are no spots on it & keep it nice and clean, as the day it was delivered! LOL!!!  Also purchased the cutting board on top---which worked out great-especially keeping your dish on top till toasting is finished.\n \n  I've always had toaster ovens, but the place we have lived in for the last 10 years has very limited counter space and I tried to find a small one that wouldn't be so obtrusive. The problem is the real small ones are kind of junky. I bought one and used it for a while when we first moved in, but got rid of it because it wasn't very good and looked terrible after a while. So I bought a regular toaster and missed having a toaster oven every day. When I was able to free up some counter space this year, I started searching again. I perused the ratings on Amazon for a lot of toaster ovens, and the smaller ones seemed lacking. Because it had \"compact\" in the title, I came across the Breville. The reviews were through the roof, but I hesitated because it isn't really all that compact. However, I decided to buy one a few months ago, and have been very happy with it. It is so classy looking, that I can even forget about how big it is. The controls are kind of complicated and took a little getting used to, but they work really well. It does everything really well--toasting, baking, and even broiling. Most toaster ovens are worthless for broiling, but I actually broiled lamb chops in it and they came out pretty nice, without the mess of cooking them in my regular oven broiler. The bake function actually works better than my regular oven for which I have to use an oven thermometer because the temperature settings are so off. Between grilling outside, and the the Breville, I don't think I've used my regular oven all summer! The only negative comment I have, is that the rack doesn't automatically slide out when you open the door. That is the only reason I gave it 4, rather than 5 stars. It is often awkward to get the food out. However on the plus side, I've never had a toaster oven that's as easy to clean, especially the crumb tray.\n \n  I hated my $28.00 toaster oven from Brands Mart.  Yes it toasted.....but it took forever and looked alot like a crappy $28.00 toaster oven.  I had been eyeballing this oven for over a year and finally decided I had to give it a try.  At first it was just a good working toaster oven.....but lately I've been enjoying the oven features as well.  I roasted some chicken breasts today and they came out terrific.  Nice not to have to heat up the \"big\" oven for just a few items.  I haven't mentioned how this does not look crappy on my counter.  It looks like a beautiful kitchen tool.  You won't be sorry if you purchase this product.\n \n  It looks great and very easy to use\n \n  It lasted all of three uses. On the fourth use it died.....totally dead. A call to Breville Customer Service was even more frustrating. Their message says to \"press 8 for a call back\" to keep from waiting on the line. It didn't work. Finally got a human after 19 minutes on \"your call is important to us\". At least I think she was human. She seemed as eager to be helpful as a lamp post, with the phone presence to match. She insisted I try a different power outlet while on the phone with her even after I told her I had already tried that AND assured the outlets had power. Turns out they won't give a refund, only a replacement. But didn't learn that until after another 10 minutes on the phone. For the price of this thing, you'd think they could be more accommodating. Rest assured, another Breville product will never be found in my possession!\n \n  The small, compact feature of this oven is for naught since it requires and extra 8 inches of counter space to use.  The outside gets too hot to touch.  I returned it without cooking anything in it.\n \n  I purchased this item as a Christmas Present for my wife.  This unit is to replace an old B&D toaster oven.  I selected this particular model after much research and consideration.  Consumer Reports gave this product the next to the highest rating, second only to this product's larger version.  It took a month of use to give this product an informed review.  First thing we noticed is that all the functions work as advertised except \"Bake\".  It seemes to take longer to bake than it should.  After a few times, I decided to contact Breville Customer Service for some answers.  The gal I spoke with explained that this product is \"different\" and that I should add additional temp to that which we selected, ie.. from 350 up to 400 degrees. I queried, 350 is 350 unless your on some other planet.  She replayed that this additional selected temp is what they are instructed to tell their customers.  I responded that there is no mention of this proceedure in the owner's manual. Since then, we took an oven thermometer and compaired the reading on the thermometer with the selected temp and sure enough, the values were not even close.  For example, to achive 350 temp, select 375-400 degrees.  For the price, one would think they would include better and more accutate compnents.  Other than that, we're pretty happy with the product.  One other feature I would recommend, would be an interior light, so as to be able to see how your food is progressing.  As a retired commercial pilot, food service is not my strong point.\n \n  I'm still getting to know all the features.  I love the oven so far!  I use it more than my microwave and my regular size oven!  I have baked, broiled, and reheated.  This brand was recommended on Consumer Reports!\n ", "\n  Before remodeling a kitchen I decided to buy this before I was without an oven for a couple of weeks.  It bakes well and is very adjustable. After reading the instructions (a must for something like this) I was able to make entire meals with it. The little bump out on the back actually lets you bake 12 inch pizzas. It work so well that I decided I didn't even need the double oven I was planning for the kitchen. \n  This is an excellent oven,  my only regret is that I didn't opt for the next size larger. \n  Extremely nice appliance. Nicely made, feels well engineered, works extremely well. The digital display is large and easy to read. The crumb tray makes this a breeze to clean, unlike so many toaster ovens. \n  My first Breville stopped working after 10 years. Honestly, for the price I expect better durability. Do the math. Dollars per year is high. Having written that, I bought another one. I expect this to last the rest of my life!\n \n  Had to read the instructions to figure out how to adjust browness of toast, but now the toast is very uniformly toasted and very uniform in color from day to day.  Have yet to try any of the other features, but am hoping that broiling will work as well as toasting.\n \n  I bought two of these for my daughters.  I have the larger size and I use it so much I thought they would be a great gift for them. They thought so too.  Breville is a quality brand and it is very simple to use.\n \n  Not great at broiling, but great at everything else. It's my second one.\n \n  This practically replaced my regular oven, every option works like a charm, cooks evenly, easy to clean and doesn\u2019t take up too much counter space.\n \n  I've had a number of toaster ovens in the past 20 years and this one is excellent.  I use it at least twice a day.  Cooks beautifully, easy to understand the dials and wonderful to have the option of the 'frozen' button.  Tells me how long it will take my bagel or toast - no other toaster oven has done this.  BTW I'm female, over 65 and live alone - this oven is a perfect fit!\n \n  I love this toaster. The only thing I haven\u2019t figured out yet is to go to get the toaster look on both sides of the bread. Absolutely worth the money though.\n ", "\n  a great oven with easy settings and solid cooking.  the choices for baking, toasting, roasting, etc, are exhaustive and the size of the oven makes it so useful.  Breville products are never inexpensive, but i think that over the lifetime of the unit, it should be a value.\n \n  I appreciated the improvement and quality of the stainless steel used currently.  Original purchase several years ago, same product, had vulnerable heating component that was damaged due to cleaning; decided to acquire replacement oven; being careful.  Quality of consumer product superior to most major manufactured appliances.  My compliments.\n \n  Great for toasting bread, making sandwich melts. Has other uses but that\u2019s all we use it for. Love this toaster oven. Our previous one was by a different maker and non-digital. We like the digital aspects of this item.\n \n  This is a great replacement for my old toaster. Thank you Breville & Amazon. The breviille juicer is fantastic too!\n \n  All is Ok\n \n  I love this machine. My old one was a cuisinart that lasted about 2 \u00bd yrs before it s timer broke. I used it that way  for months. However after buying this (similar price as Cuisinart was) I can't believe how nice it is both in form and function. No timer noise, it has a brain. Love it. Would be 5 stars but I found it a little bit challenging to learn its ways.\n \n  I bought this item because I thought that it would make toasting very thin bread easy.  And, it does.  I love the digital control\n \n  We've had the oven for about 3 months now and are very happy with it.  It makes the most fantastic toast we've ever had. It's great for bagels and toasting burger buns too.  I use it to bake veggie burgers for lunch sometimes and they've come out great.  Our only complaint would be the fact that you have to set the bake or toast time and then it counts down. It doesn't stop if you open the door to, for example, put some cheese on a burger, it just keeps counting down. The knobs are a bit fussy but we've gotten used to it and you just can't beat the way this thing makes toast!\n \n  This has been a terrible experience. Very difficult to follow directions. We want to return this item.\n \n  We've been through our share of toaster ovens over the years, but this Breville is remarkable! From the very first use, it was amazing. Granted; the price is steeper, and it may have more features than needed, but I am so glad to have it!  I feel rather \"modern\" having such an advanced little oven. It has been easy to use. I've also never been able to say that something on the kitchen counter looks so pretty. So, I plan to find more uses for this new appliance. It does so much more than toast!\n ", "\n  I\u2019m beyond frustrated that this only toasts one side of the bread in toast mode.  Seriously, dark brown one side, super light on the other.  And yes the shelf is on the right  setting.  Disappointed to say the least.\n \n  I researched toaster ovens extensively and this one got great reviews and it hasn\u2019t disappointed. It\u2019s perfect for small spaces yet still holds reasonable sized dishes. My husband wanted one forever, I didn\u2019t want more \u2018stuff\u2019 on my kitchen counter but I\u2019m glad we have it now.\n \n  Does an excellent job using a variety of pre-programmed features. Solidly built. We use it all the time for toasting and as a small oven.  It has seen everything from bagels right out of the freezer to Shrinky Dinks. I recommend it highly.\n \n  The product arrived promptly and in good shape.  Overall, we really like this oven and use it more than I expected.  It would get 5 stars if the power cord were 10 inches longer and it came with a little cookie sheet. \n  We bought this toaster oven after reading reviews of many brands. We also checked it out in a store. It felt so well made and sturdy, that others had a hard time comparing with it. I had a little trouble figuring out how to turn it off, then realized it turns itself off after the timer has finished. All you have to do is set it, and it does the rest. I love the fact that you can tell when it is ready to cook. It pre-heats then beeps when the temperature is reached. It's definitely the most expensive toaster oven out there, but it sure is nicely made. I think we'll have it a while.\n \n  is ready\n \n  Great product! Easy to use, great features, much better than heating up the large oven for small things\n \n  Just got it and plugged it in - wow! The display screen is like a flash light in your face, even if not looking at it you know it\u2019s there. Why not darker background, similar to MW. Will keep it unplugged unless in use. Let\u2019s see how it cooks.\n \n  I found this to be the best small oven I've ever tried. And I cook a lot.\n \n  I am so happy with this purchase.  The Breville toaster oven is in my opinion, the best toaster money can buy.  I use it all the time and I am so happy with the purchase every time I use it.\n ", "\n  I love the stainless steel element IQ cooks food brown the outside and moist inside, just like I love.  It cooked fairly even.  I don't have to use the big oven anymore.  I baked chicken, cookies, toasts, warming up and many more.  I also broil and it worked well.  I have not tried pizza yet but I expect it to do well too. \n  Superior build quality. Best we have ever purchased. True temperature, easy clean.\n \n  The Breville is what my wife and I wanted. The foot print is not too large.  Makes toast with a vairey of settings that enable thin or thick sliced items and neither has been dried up at the end of the cycle.  The wife loves it for cooking when she does not want to turn on the oven.  There are only 2 of us at home and she is pleased not to have to hear the entire downstairs just to cook something in the oven.  AND it is quiet (My request) had some brand before that was so lound it was like a time bomb as it toasted. \n  Small but sturdy oven that cleans up in a breeze. I like how it \"remembers\" your toast preferences, and it comes out evenly brown! It's the perfect size for the two of us and can easily be brought out and put away without a fuss. The baking has been spot on, again I noticed that the entire casserole was evenly warmed and perfectly browned. My old Delonghi was much bigger, but this seems, so far, to be heftier and function better.\n \n  We use this toaster oven for a whole range of things we never expected we would be able to. Bake, broil, and toast all work great. We have no microwave and this allows us to not fire up the large oven every time we need to heat or cook something that doesn't need a full size over. Looks good with the rest of the stainless steel appliances and can be left on the counter as opposed to tucked away when not in use.\n \n  Used to like it. Just saw the electrical cord is half melted. We didn\u2019t use it daily so I have no idea why it fried out.\n \n  Love this toaster oven! Nice looking and great features,,,and it seems to be nice quality. Hope to have it for a long time\n \n  I expected something a bit more sturdy at this price.  Stainless steel is expensive so they used really thin sheets for construction, which makes it flimsy.  The controls have a really cheap feel as well - feels like a toy.  Seems to work OK after about a month of use.\n \n  For someone not tech savvy, it could be a challenge to learn it but it does everything perfectly!  Once you understand the features...best toaster oven I\u2019ve had!\n \n  Great toaster oven.  Doesn\u2019t take up too much space, but works great!\n ", "\n  It's just lovely.  It makes perfect bagels, toast, frozen pizza, freshly baked breads, muffins. The crumb tray is excellent and easy to clean.  The presets are genius as is the warming tray on top.  The whole thing is so easy to learn and use.  My only criticism is that if you put something in during preheat it will get overdone if you don't dramatically adjust your cook time. I just don't have patience for preheating....I've got a hungry toddler who needs his chicken nuggets quickly! \n  This is a great appliance. Easy to use, reliable, consistent. We bought two for family members and one for ourselves. Everyone loves it.\n \n  It\u2019s a nice countertop stove. I had to return this one because it was too small for what I needed but bought the same but bigger and it\u2019s a really good investment. I don\u2019t have a big stove, I cook everything. All my meals on this one, it\u2019s a life saver and saves you space! Totally recommend it.\n \n  Pie and cake pans fit and the good come out as well as the larger oven.  I have not had it long enough to add more.\n \n  Short and sweet - I had reservations about purchasing a toaster oven this expensive.  My reservations were unfounded as this is utterly worth it.  Easy to use (Apple could have designed the U.I) and accurate in temperature with a host of easy to access features make this work every penny.  From toasting a bagel to cooking a steak this works better than any other toaster oven I have ever owned.  I bought the medium sized one which is big enough for anything save a 12\" pizza.\n \n  Make sure you read all directions. It may feel like there is a great deal to learn but once you get it all figured out, you will wonder how you lived without it.\n \n  this my second breville  toaster oven and have been satisfied with both. they are easy to use and efficient\n \n  My black and decker broke down after 19 months, which I thought was way too short of a time, so I did some research on Consumer Reports and found this model but it broke down in 19 months also. Granted, I used this model much more than the black and decker so the question is how many more hours did I get and was it worth the extra cost? \n  We are loving this toaster oven.  We have had it a little over 8 months and use it all the time.  It creates a super even toast, and I love the timer that automatically starts up.  I also use this as an oven for individual portioned size foods and it's fabulous for that too.  My mom came to visit and wouldn't stop talking about it, so I bought one for her too!\n \n  I really like this toaster oven but I do think it's overpriced. My other complaint is that there is no clock setting. True, it's not a necessity, but I thought it was almost standard for a toaster oven to default to a clock setting when not in use. What I do like is that it's small enough to fit on my counter top without compromising a lot of counter space. I also like the fact that it bakes like a full-size oven. This has been a real treat for me because using my large oven heats up my whole apartment. The toaster oven heat is contained within the oven.\n ", "\n  I use this oven at least once a day.  The controls appeared intimidating when I first started using the oven!  After a couple of days I found how intuitive and helpful they are.  The defrost function is easy to use.  The bagel function results in perfect toasted bagels!  Browned on the cut side; crusty on the outside. \n  Bought it for my husband. He just loves it.\n \n  I gave this as a gift.  I have a Breville also and love it.\n \n  this toaster oven gets used a lot-we cook most of our meals in it-great for two people -saves electric -don't have to use the big regular oven very much  roger\n \n  Took us the first few trys of cooking to get a good feeling for how the temperature and cook time vary to our day to day food. Basically, cooks much faster and way more efficient and actually heats extremely even. Excellent buy.\n \n  Pretty good for a countertop compact oven but Breville missed big-time on the design of the rack.  Though the oven cavity is shared with a round-out in the back to accommodate THEIR round pan, if you cook on the rack, (as many recipes call for) watch out!  The rack doesn't cover the cavity round-out and so items can easily slip off the rear and fall into the heating element.  Even certain pizza whose crust is meant to be a bit softer than thin crusts, will droop into the abyss whilst cooking.  A simple design miss.  Perhaps an opportunity for the aftermarket to supply.  Other than that, it would be really good if the oven went up to 475, not 450 max.\n \n  It doesn\u2019t do the job well, temperature is not distributed evenly. It was a waste of money for me. I would return it if I could. It\u2019s an expensive toaster, as I\u2019d doesn\u2019t work well for backing or roasting.\n \n  It has a sleek design, but I haven't found a toaster oven yet that can really toast evenly.  The settings, however, are very good as you can set them for darkness and the number of pieces of bread and that seems to work well. It lacks handles and gets hot on the sides so can't push it back into its corner for a little while. It has separate settings for \"pizza,\" \"cookies,\" and \"reheat,\" but I haven't tried those yet.  The broiler grill and baking pan are enameled but the instructions recommend that they not be washed in the dishwasher.  Not happy about that.\n \n  Must have kitchen gadget. Works like a charm. Great for cookies, cupcakes, pastries. Also for roasting.. For toasting.. Everything really. You're only hindered by the size.. But its efficient and fast at heating.\n \n  I chose this oven cause of all the great reviews...and I am right there with the great reviews.  I am so please with this oven.  I have baked a few baked potatoes and toast all the time, and simply love the way everything turned out and guess what my kitchen did not get hot in this VERY hot weather in Colorado..yea!  The only thing I have found so far that I do not like is that the top of the oven gets sooooo hot, you have to buy the cutting board to put on top, that was a life safer...BUT, it should have been included with the oven..or they should come up with something/anything else to not make you buy the cutting board in order for the oven not to burn what it is under.\n ", "\n  Love this toaster oven. Wasn't sure it would be worth the price because we typically by the cheapest toaster ovens we can find. So far it is working beautifully and is so easy to clean. Also, since I am pushing fifty the controls are very easy to read. We would definitely recommend it.\n \n  SOOOOO glad we got this. It works so well. Heats up quickly. Wipes clean easy. Great size for us. Holds enough food for at least two people -- two frozen meals at the same time, etc. I do wish it came with two racks so multiple things could be heated at the same time. Its a good size for our counter too (not the smallest, but not the biggest either). Highly highly recommend!\n \n  Bought a refurbish and everything worked great\n \n  This is a great toaster oven. Having spent way too many years with a POS black and decker toaster oven, this unit is incredibly well designed and performs beautifully. We've made several types of toast (wheat bread, English muffins, raisin bread, etc) and it has toasted perfectly. Made ginger cake today and again, it bakes beautifully. The controls are intuitive and work well.\n \n  an office of 50+ people + picky requirements for design = it has been hard for us to get a good toaster. \n  This is a fantastic toaster oven.  We've owned several of the cheap ones over the years and decided to splurge on a more expensive one and we love it.  It's very roomy on the inside although the description reads 'compact'.  Perfect for our two person household.\n \n  When our 17-year-old Cuisinart oven gave up the ghost, we had a few basic requirements: looks decent; about the same size as the one it was replacing; very easy to use; toasts bread well; and doesn't have an ear-piercing alarm, like the Cuisinart had, that would wake the neighbors just to announce your toast is ready.  This Breville checked off all the requirements.  So far, we love it.\n \n  This is the legendary John Siracusa \"toaster\" as talked about on Hypercritical, so really that should be enough said. \n  I use this little oven every day. For one person it is very useful. I bought it before Christmas for side dishes. Every day it makes me happy. Perfect size for my small kitchen & limited counter space. Works better than a larger Cuisinart I've used in the past & takes up much less room. Hope it keeps working as long as I do.\n \n  Love My Breville!  I have limited counter space and an unreliable oven, so the \"mini\" solved all my problems. I toast, bake, broil, etc. and it's absolutely exactly what I need. Highly recommend !\n ", "\n  Can not use to toast! Only will toast top side!  This is the 2nd unit and both performed the same!  We downsized from the bov800xl which performed as expected after it was repaired!  I question the QC they have... \n  I had my last oven for 7 years and used it daily.  I liked it so much I bought the exact same oven to replace it.  I love Breville Compact Smart Oven.  It warms up quickly and small pans and a pizza fit nicely.  It cooks perfectly.\n \n  Love it.  It is my second one.  I use a toaster oven a lot, so burnt out my other.  I use it instead of the regular oven when cooking for 1/2 people.  When I have to cook  a lot at one time, I use it along with me oven.  Very easy to adjust the settings. I like the categories and guides for adjusting the rack.  The ding signal is loud enough to hear and the auto shut off is a food saver!!\n \n  It works great. Easy to use dials. I think I might get the chopping board that fits on top of it. Everything comes out perfect and it is super easy to clean ...my last toaster oven looked terrible because it was so hard to clean it. That's the only reason I got a new one really. but I'm glad I did. Wish I'd have spent the extra money for the convection style. I have a built-in convection oven and it's great. Guess I was being a cheapo.\n \n  I bought this on a Black Friday deal.  This is a quality oven that I should have bought years ago.  Heats fast, cooks fast, looks good and is easy to clean.  This is used almost daily.\n \n  Bought one plugged it in where my old one was tripped the breaker in the garage. Thought it was a faulty unit returned it for another one. Did the same thing tripped my breaker.\n \n  Over was nice until it just stopped working. Two adults using normally. Top dollar paid for a piece of junk. Don't buy this over.\n \n  Excellent out of the box.  Bought in November 2017. One heating element not working and the other is on its way out as cooking time has increased. Looking for a new unit now probably from a different company\n \n  It is great. Everything is timed so finally can\u2019t burn the toast ha. Love the different shelf levels for bagels. Toast etc. \n  I'm not sure what are all the bad reviews about this oven but i've had mine for 7 years, use it almost everyday and it's still works like new, no electrical problems, no complaints whatsoever. I paid 200$ on sale in 2011 and I've never regretted it one bit. I cooked everything in this oven. I'm a single home owner and that thing paid itself up in electricity alone instead of using the big oven to bake a small batch of fries for exemple and takes half the time to heat up without warming up the whole kitchen for hours. The four elements cooks very evenly. As a matter of fact I was so impressed by the toasts function that i threw away my toaster for this. I really love the compact size of it. If you have a family I would go with the newer bigger one. My only complain would be that there is no light in it... but the newer one do. ", "\n  I love this oven. I have no issues with it, it does the job. Easy toasting, easy baking.\n \n  I use it for toasting, baking, and broiling. Nice for a single guy and easy to clean.\n \n  Overall a great appliance! Looks good, easy to use and clean. The only issue I found is the assisted door closing hinges, slams closed if you are not careful.\n \n  Easy to use\n \n  Best toaster oven I have ever owned. We use the crap out of this oven. Reheating, baking, toast, bagels. Etc.. Easy clean up and looks great on my newly remodeled kitchen.\n \n  I've had this thing for two months, now.  I've toasted sliced bread, bagels, muffins and sandwich rolls; baked frozen biscuits and frozen dessert pastries; and broiled open-faced sandwiches.  It performed perfectly on all of those tasks.  I've never been a fan of toaster ovens, but this one does a better job toasting than the drop-in toasters I've used and is quickly replacing my wall-mounted double convection oven for a lot of small jobs.\n \n  Two years later: The oven still works fine. The only thing is that the roof of this toaster oven is NOT non-stick. We add a sheet of aluminum foil to the top over the heating elements to catch oil that spatters up. Wished it was all non-stick. Other than that, it's a great oven.\n \n  We enjoy using this oven, but our second one just conked out with error message EO5 or EOS. It lasted 1 year and 3 months. Our first one lasted about the same amount of time. It's really a shame, because it's a great size and it works pretty well, when it's working. We're now looking at other brands to replace this one, since it is no longer in warranty.\n \n  wasnt crazy about spending this much on a toaster over, but it was a good investment, cooks to perfection.. definitely recommend\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I have ever used.  It is aesthetic, well-engineered, intuitive, logical, and - most importantly - performs flawlessly.  I have not used all of its functions, but the ones that I have used met or exceeded my expectations.  If you make the adjustments that are directed, such as specifying the number of slices of bread in the toaster and specifying how dark you want the toast, it makes perfect toast.  The accessories (tray and pan) are substantial, the crumb tray conveniently removes from the front, and the controls feel like they belong in BMW rather than on a kitchen appliance.\n ", "\n  It is a bit big in footprint but so far a good unit.\n \n  Great for toasting and for baking. Really versatile\n \n  I enjoyed this toaster oven for the most part. It was an expensive investment for an appliance that didn't always work as expected. For example, the temp gage was just wrong. Takes at least twice as long as it should took cook and toast. And then there's the blowing-up bit. After just 5 years the thermal fuse blew up on me today. 5 years for a $180 purchase? I've had $20 appliances last longer. And no customer support. Either skip Breville all together or go for the one that's $250. That seems to have better results. Me? I'll avoid Breville in the future\n \n  I'm really glad I found this product!  Our old 2-slice toaster oven gave up the ghost.  I bought another $40 toaster oven that was horrible as a toaster and as an oven! I guess that's what to expect for the price. I was going to just add a toaster and live with both on my counter top, until I saw the Breville in my parents' newly remodeled kitchen.  They love theirs. It makes great toast and bagels, and is large enough for lots of other baking/heating tasks.  If price is not your main criteria and you have the counter space, I recommend this oven!\n \n  I absolutely love my compact smart oven. Size is perfect for my small apartment. I love the smart features and both myself and my boyfriend find it extremely easy to use. I love that we can customize the settings for each of our particular tastes. It's fun to watch grill marks developing on my toast! Bagels come out PERFECTLY with the top getting toasted and the bottom still chewy and not dried out. The unit gets hot so be careful where you place it and don't touch the sides! The slide out crumb tray makes for easy cleaning. The only thing I miss is that it does not have a convection option. \n  Crazy about this toaster oven! It's really intuitive, easy to use, heats up SO much more quickly than my full sized oven, and is the perfect size for my small kitchen. I have other Breville products and paid out the wazoo for them, so I was so pleased to be able to buy this at such a competitive price from Amazon Warehouse.\n \n  Great little oven. Beware the strong spring in the door. It doesn't take too much of a bump when opened for it to slam shut with great force.\n \n  This is the unit of our dreams... works perfectly with lots of control.\n \n  This toaster oven is worth the price. You get quality that used to be ordinary, but now is rarely seen. I love the sturdy looks and heavy rack inside, the precise choices of time and heat, and the way the food tastes as if it has been treated gently and expertly. Like others I wish the rack would come forward when the door opens. I'm always searching for something to pull it out with when its hot. Otherwise I try to use this oven instead my big one.\n \n  2 years later and it works like a champ, and looks like one too. ", "\n  did plenty of research and decided on this one. debated between compact and full size but we've been happy with compact and for the $ difference, we are happy with it. good little features like reverting to your last settings, quick to preheat\n \n  I bought this as a gift, and it\u2019s great to have in the kitchen.  I also own a Breville oven, and I hardly ever have to use my large gas oven!\n \n  I have purchased three of these Breville Compact ovens, so obviously think that they are a good appliance!  I first bought one to use while our kitchen was being remodeled.  It worked great.  I even used it to bake a pork tenderloin roast, which turned out moist and delicious!  I have since given one to each of my married children for house-warming gifts.  They LOVE them!  They work great as both a toaster and as an oven.  They make it so convenient to warm small amounts like dinner rolls or french bread, and also work great to cook a pizza or even bake a small tray of cookies.  It is quicker, easier and cheaper than heating large ovens. You can't tell from the photo, but the back of the oven rounds out at the tray level to about an 11.5 inch depth, so you can fit a 10-inch pizza in the oven. My kids have all said that this is one of the best gifts they have received.  I would buy it again!  ( Note: Breville makes a little larger oven that also has a convection feature.  But it is larger than what we want, and we have that feature in our ovens).  I LOVE the size and utility of this one and highly recommend it !\n \n  It works very well, but you do have to read instructions or at least try out the settings so you know what you are doing. Once you have that down, it works perfectly well. No more baked potatoes from the micro wave - the Breville makes the best baked potatoes ever! Toast is toasted on both sides and nicely crisp. \n  Very happy with the performance of the oven. Perfect for our counter needs.\n \n  Have had this for quiet some time now and love it. I use it for pizza and baking when I don\u2019t want to get the big oven going. I would def recommend for others.\n \n  Works great. Heats food up fast and well built. Me and my husband love it.\n \n  Since this got so many good reviews; it may be \"user error\" or simply the way i use it but I was disappointed. I wanted an oven to keep from heating the whole house in the Summer and as an oven it is usually good. A small roast or stuffed chicken breast or casserole comes out great. Baked potatoes seem to need higher heat or more time; at 350, I have to leave potatoes in for an hour and a half! \n  This little oven has been with me for several months and never failed to do what was expected.  It makes great toast every morning.  It can bake anything that doesn't require too much head room. ( a loaf of bread may rise too high)  I have used it for meatloaf, pork roasts, etc.  The broiler has done salmon to perfection. It has cooked pizza and reheated the left-overs.  The setting categories are useful and since it remembers the previous setting, there is little need to change them.  It takes up very little counter space and with the Breville Bamboo serving tray on top, that counter space is essentially replaced. I'd hate to be without it.\n \n  Ok\n ", "\n  I now have bought four of these Breville toaster ovens for myself and friends as gifts.  I think that says enough.  My friend has told me that the toaster has changed their toasting and cooking experiences.\n \n  Well designed and built\n \n  We bought this model based on the recommendation of my sister. We had chance to use hers while visiting and decided to give it a try. We wanted this particular size because we have a under-cabinet mounting system that frees up valuable counter space.It takes a a little experimenting with the digital controls, but the big advantage is that it's easy to set the over at the exact same setting for particular items. \n  Purchased this toaster oven as an alternative to using the microwave and oven for smaller items (pizza, corn dogs, muffins etc). We love how quickly it heats up and how easy it is to use.  The oven has nice bumpers on the back to prevent the oven from getting too close to the wall.  Racks are easy to remove and clean. \n  Love, love, love my toaster oven! I've had it a while now and can do everything with it. It is easy to use and very powerful. I use it in one form or another everyday whether it's for toast or baking something to broiling, it does everything!\n \n  Love it more and more every day that I  use it.\n \n  This Breville is a replacement for a 7 year old model. The old one still worked fine but the wear and tear of daily use was beginning to show. The new one works flawlessly and looks much nicer in my kitchen. Having owned several different brands over the years, Breville has proven to be the most rugged, well built toaster oven that I have found. I love it.\n \n  Great little oven. Love that fact that it doesn't \"tick\", heats up instantly, is compact and well-built. Looking to try out more \"entrees' with this soon.\n \n  Haven\u2019t had it a year and it just stopped working\n \n  I don't know what to say, I'm just a little numb at how much value this packs for the price. I'm actually getting the 800XL in about a week. You wont go wrong here, buy this now before the price skyrockets.\n ", "\n  I bought my first Breville oven almost 8 years ago.  Loved it, but it just completely quit working a couple of days ago (I suppose the fuse everyone talks about blew out).  Ordered this same model to replace it.  If I get another 8 years I'll be happy.\n \n  Our previous Breville died after about 10 years of daily use. The new version on a prime day deal was a great buy. The features and design similar with small improvements and cheaper than the one we bought a long time ago. Excellent quality product.\n \n  Seriously, your only decision should be which model to buy. I went with this size because the larger oven was just too large and I didn't need another convection oven. Trust me, and the many other reviewers here who have said the same, and buy a Breville. You will understand as soon as you use it why, and as it outlasts all other brands you will only become happier that you did.\n \n  Very good quality, is exactly what I needed. I love it!\n \n  Great Owen.\n \n  I hesitated to buy this because of price...so glad I did. I got a \"damaged\" box from Amazon & saved some money by doing that. The oven works perfectly...1st time we've had toast that's evenly toasted in years. My 19 year old son uses it constantly & says it's by far the best we've ever had. Yes, you will need to read the instructions, but it is quite easy to operate, sturdy, efficient & worth what I paid.\n \n  A very sturdy machine. Toasts and bakes evenly. Everything feels well made and the oven was well thought out. Very easy to use and see the settings.\n \n  I own the larger one as well in another home.  These are good products.  In general it is work paying the extra $70 for the larger smart oven.  This is basically a toaster and an expensive one of high quality.\n \n  Especially love the crumb tray.  I have roasted vegetables in this oven and they came out great.  The warming feature is good.  Also recommend getting the bamboo cutting board to place on top as a safety to prevent getting burned.  In the past I bought cheaper toaster ovens of a brand I used to trust.  It never worked right.  You get what you pay fir!\n \n  So happy that Amazon put this oven on sale for Black Friday. I\u2019ve wanted to buy this for over a year now, and to be able to save a lot of money, made this purchase all worth while.\n ", "\n  Use it for everything.  Quiet and looks good.\n \n  Since I have 2 of these, I must REALLY like it. For a single person, it does it all. No need to use a \"big\" oven for anything. I have one at home and bought this one for cottage in summer and to take south with me in the winter.  Totally terrific\n \n  Toaster oven in our vacation home lost it's ability to bake; so I began to check reviews of the ovens available, here and elsewhere. Bought the Breville compact and immediately fell in love with it.  Got back to our permanent home and bought my second even though the one we had was just fine. (took old one to recycle thrift shop, after cleaning it). The Breville remembers settings, though easy to change, lets me know when finished cooking and turns itself off. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the outside gets hot, so loses heat and could be a real danger to someone not aware that the shell is quite hot.\n \n  Super item. Very intuitive controls. I went from unboxing to using this oven in about 20 minutes. Sleek design and looks great in my kitchen.\n \n  Both my husband and I love this little oven, it does a great job both baking and toasting.  I would really suggest you buy it.  The only con I have, is that it doesn't have a stop when you pull out the shelfs, so be careful not to pull them out to far.  Other then that, you will not be disappointed if you purchase this oven. Easy to use even for the first time.\n \n  I love this oven.  My oven in my old apartment went out before I moved and  used this oven for baking cookies, chicken, pizza without making the kitchen hot. I recommend.\n \n  It has never worked. Very disappointed that we now have to deal with a brand new, completely useless product.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. I purchased after extensively reading other Amazon reviews.\n \n  Heats fast.  Consistent\n \n  I have aways bought the typical toaster ovens for around 150 buck. I decided to try this one after reading the great  reviews. It really is so much better for just a couple more bucks.  My only comment is that the knobs feel very \"cheap\", but I suppose that can be expected.\n ", "\n  It is a bit confusing at first, but the Manuel that comes with it is excellent and once you get the hang of it the end result is wonderful.\n \n  this is a small oven in every way have almost given up the regular oven . just what i wanted. great for 1 person cooking\n \n  I would buy it \"AGAIN.\"  So far, it has been the very best toaster oven I have ever had.  OK! So it's the \"ONLY\" toaster oven I've ever purchased, but it does an excellent job of replacing my traditional toaster, which is exactly why I bought it. MY REVIEW - It's a great product!\n \n  Works wonderful. Great little machine.  I have only used the Broil, Toast and bake features and all work wonderfully.  I have used the Bake feature to thaw frozen fully cooked Schwan's Breaded Chicken Breasts and I had to decrease the temp and time as the little over works pretty quickly and did not take as long as the directions said.\n \n  This toaster oven is so much better than my old one. It toasts wonderfully and I can control browning by number of slices and 7 different levels of darkness. It also shows the time it takes to toast which is very nice. I have a stove with only  one oven, and love to cook, so this toaster oven is perfect for side dishes for roasting vegetables and baking potatoes too. I am looking forward to trying the other functions also. The oven costs a little more than others, but the results seem well worth the additional cost.\n \n  HAD FOR A FEW YEARS STILL WORKS BUT IS SLOW AND UNEVERN  EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS\n \n  Had to return, as bread was toasted unevenly. Top was dark and bottom was undercooked with stripes where touching rack.\n \n  Awesome toaster oven. Easy to use and cooks great\n \n  Love it!! I can stop using my oven for a lot of things.  Worth every penny\n \n  Cooking and reheating. Large pizza does not fit but love it!\n ", "\n  I have had several toaster ovens over the last few years, including Cuisinart and Black & Decker.  This time around, when I needed to replace the Cuisinart I did some research and decided to purchase the Breville.  I am thrilled with everything about this toaster oven.  I like the way it looks.  It's easy to clean, especially with the front slide out tray.  It's very accurate and even though the instructions sound a little complicated at first glance, it's acutally very easy to use.  I recommend this product highly!!!\u00a0\n Breville BOV650XL Compact 4-Slice Smart Oven with Element IQ \n  Very good\n \n  Awesome\n \n  es muy rapido y funsional para todo tipo de servicio en la cocina como calentar, hornear, tostar, cocinar etc, me gusta mucho el tama\u00f1o de su interior y el sistema inteligente que tiene.\n None \n  Expensive for a toaster but you get what you pay for.  This oven is probably the best one we've had over the years. It toasts and top browns well and the controls are easy to use.  It also heats up well making it easy to reheat foods.\n \n  Paid $179 in August I felt like buying another one when I saw the price drop before this I spent $49 on a different brand they always say you pay for what you get\n \n  This has been the most cost-worthy appliance I have purchased in years! First and foremost, it is easy to clean! I have used this oven almost daily for five months (since purchase) and it has performed A+ at every setting of the dial. I particularly like the removable crumb tray. Glass cleans very easily. Highly recommended!\n \n  didn't keep item\n \n  Its a good size, makes excellent toast and bagels and generally does what it says it does.  We have owned it for about 2 months and have no complaints.  We have baked potatoes and reheated food in it also. It is a little more expensive and it does get hot.  It fits under the cabinets easily. \n  CAnt miss with this.\n ", "\n  I loved\n \n  We\u2019ve owned this model for 4.5 years now, and I love it! I use it regularly instead of our full size oven to make meals for our family of four. Reliable, intuitive, and well worth every penny spent!\n \n  Well made. Reliable and easy to use.\n \n  Easy to use and works great\n \n  I have never, ever submitted a product review, but felt that I needed to on this one.  My Breville toaster oven arrived a couple of weeks ago and it has become an indispensible appliance in my kitchen.  I have found that I use it almost daily, from toast to baking to reheating.  Being newly widowed, it has been a challange shopping and cooking for one.  There were always too much of whatever.  I would freeze it then reheat in my big oven, only to wind up throwing the over or under heated meals into the disposal.  Now, with the 'brain' in this oven, everything heats perfectly.  The reheat cycle is amazing.  Pizza reheated is beter than originally baked.  It is expensive, but I guarantee that you will not regret adding this appliance to your home. Go ahead, go for it and make your life easier.\n \n  Great little oven, I use it at least 4 times a week or more. I use it for sandwiches, frozen pizza, hot dogs, corn dogs, and even toast on occasion. So far it has been a very welcome addition to this single man's kitchen.\n \n  I really like using my new toaster oven. The Breville toaster oven it very user friendly and everything I cook in it comes out perfect. I only thing is I was thinking it was going to just a bit bigger.\n \n  love my grill-oven combo single and use a lot\n \n  I use this for so many things!  I wold highly recommend it.  The only things I would wish for it would be:  It would be nice if it had an internal light, and it would be nice if the labels on the front were illuminated as they are a little hard to see in a dark kitchen.\n \n  I had one before so I already knew about it.  The buttons are a little hard to get used to, but it works great.\n ", "\n  Top-rated toaster oven--deserves every good review.\n \n  Solid construction, feels like commercial equipment. Really easy to use despite the many settings options which generally seem to make sense and create the stated effect. Heats very quickly. It does take up a good amount of space, not to mention the additional needed for when the door is open. Buying the optional cutting board may make a lot of storage sense because of all the wasted space on top. Price is high, but for a larger, decent cuisine-art etc you are spending around $100 anyway. I think in the long run this will be easier to clean and keep new looking than other high end toaster overs. Worth the extra money to me. \n  So far it's working as expected.....A good purchase\n \n  four stars for the rack not having the little curve to stop the rail from coming out, but overall I'm happy with it. I bought it purely for the look :). I only toast in it so I don't have issues with the oven not reaching the desired temperature as many reviews complained about.\n \n  I\u2019ve now ordered two of these ovens and am very impressed at how easy they are to clean compared to previous ovens.  The cleaning tray removes from the front.  Even toasting.  Have not tried baking yet.\n \n  Anyone thinking of getting a Breville should think of this one over the smaller version.  I have baked muffins, pizza, sweet rolls, bagels, toast and so far am very impressed.  The only knock I'd give it is it needs a louder timer that goes off and keeps going off till you silence it.  But love it so far.\n \n  Very consistent operation good quality overall. Don\u2019t like racks ability to slide right out of oven should have a detent.\n \n  This oven has a learning curve so it took me awhile to realize that it wasn't me, but the oven that wasn't working properly. The upper element does not heat well enough to brown white bread in the toasting cycle no matter how high I set it. Even three times through a dark toasting cycle and my toast, while warm, is unequivocally white on one side and golden on the other. It is a lovely looking appliance; the size is right and it promised to do much. Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ \n  .  Will have to visit Williams Sonoma and take a closer look at these. I purchased the Breville based on customer reviews, but lemons do slip through. Still, I am very disappointed.\n \n  I use it daily.\n \n  Getting used to the pre-heat time, and the fact that it has a very soft \"Done\" bell, were the only minor problems we have had with this toaster oven. Other than that, it is a great oven and we love it. The highest recommendation.\n ", "\n  It's a little too soon to rate the Breville oven since I've only used it 3-4 times.  However, my major requirement in a \"toaster oven\" is that is cleans easily and well; this one seems to satisfy that requirement.  Did make wonderful toast as claimed, but I have yet to bake a casserole in it.  I am confident that it will serve my needs just fine\n \n  I've had several toaster ovens, throughout the years, but this one is the best to date. \n  Excellent toaster oven, best leftover reheater, we have not used our conventional oven since we started using it. Easy to use, easy to clean, doesn't use as much electricity as large oven or give out as much heat. I have used cheap toaster ovens in the past and they all got scary after a while.  I love this toaster oven.\n \n  Versatile. Large enough to bake ready-made meals for our family or toast for one. Toasting function recognizes when the unit is hot and adjusts the time accordingly.  Baking function preheats oven before beginning baking sequence.  Only complaint is that the led panel remains illuminated longer than necessary.\n \n  I love it.  I really like the timer that comes with each setting. toasts and bakes great\n \n  My favorite thing in my kitchen! I use this more than my microwave or oven! Definetly buy this,  it is worth it!!\n \n  Good all purpose oven.\n \n  We now use this more than our regular oven as it heats up fast; signals when it's ready to bake and when it is finished. We actually use it to replace our microwave, although it does take longer to heat up foods than does a microwave.\n \n  We've had the same old B&D toaster over for 15 years and it finally became too much of an eyesore in our kitchen.  We did a lot of research and shopping and there were so many choices it was very confusing.  We decided we wanted a plain old toaster oven - for, of all things, toasting bread!  Of course we use it for other general baking and it excels in all areas.  It is a beautiful addition to our kitchen, easy to use, and bakes perfectly with easy presets and selections. It's a bit pricey, but we couldn't find anything cheaper that did what we wanted and looked like it belonged in a nice kitchen.\n \n  This is the 2nd one, our first one broke after 5 years so we purchased the same one again\n ", "\n  bought this for my Mother and she loved, I eventually bought the larger size from bed bath and beyond with 20% off coupon,  BBB assuming does not accept coupon for Breville product but they took it\n \n  We bought this as a House Warming gift and the people we bought it for love it.\n \n  Love this! Got it when my oven was broken. Works great and the preset buttons are great from toast to cookies to broil.\n \n  LOVE this. It preheats and beeps when the set temp is reached, has a built in timer, AND turns itself off when done.\n \n  So far I really like the ease of use of this product. Does what it says\n \n  A very user friendly appliance.\n \n  It's simple to use and efficient.\n \n  Works great.\n \n  This is a great size for my husband and I.  We use it daily with many of the settings\n \n  I absolutely LOVE my Breville Smart Oven!  I have 4 kids and use this to toast bread/bagels, cook hot dogs and pizza, warm up leftovers - pretty much everything I would do in a toaster or my full-size oven.  It is used 2-3 times every day and is still working flawlessly after 18 months of use. It may be expensive, but for my household, it is worth every penny!\n ", "\n  I'm still learning how to operate my toaster oven perfectly but the pork loin and stuffed pork chops came out baked to perfection. I'm very pleased with my choice and Amazon's part in sales and delivery.\n \n  We use this mutliple times a day in place of a microwave and it works great! Easy to clean!\n \n  I bought this toaster oven last Christmas for my daughter based on the comments of users on the kitchen forum of gardenweb.com. They were right, this toaster is worth the extra that it costs. Hers was so great that I broke down and bought one for myself this year. After seeing mine, a friend bought one for herself and is equally pleased. I've cooked sweet potatoes and meatloaf in this oven as well as the more usual toast, and everything comes out great.\n \n  I've used this oven mostly for toast and heating quick breads. It toasts evenly. I followed the recipe for twice-baked potatoes, after first cooking the whole potato in the microwave to save time. So far, it works according to the manual directions.\n \n  It arrived quickly, sets up easy, and it's easy to use.  We have so far only made toast, waffles and bagels in it.  We haven't done any serious baking yet.  The size is perfect for the corner of our counter.  It's a winner!\n \n  Everything they said it was more.  After 4 toaster oven in past years this is by far worth every cent.\n \n  Getting a second for second home. \n  I purchased this for friends and they love it and are using it every time I am over.  Not a complaint one and I think it look great in their kitchen\n \n  We bought this for my 91 year-old mother who is NOT technologically savvy. She figured out how to use this right away and likes that she doesn't have to heat up the oven for a small amount of food.\n \n  I use this oven every day and love it! I almost never turn on my big oven and frequently take this one to family gatherings where we need extra cooking or warming capabilities.\n ", "\n  I love this oven because of how evenly it heats!\n \n  This is my second one.  Ordered a new one after many years as the door area was not easy to clean if at all\n \n  We have been using it for just a few weeks and so far it is one of the best toaster ovens we have purchased. \n  Love the air fryer and slow cook functions. Ideal.\n \n  We love it.  I wanted to buy one a couple years ago but was told to wait until our other toaster over died.  Death came none too soon.\n \n  We Love ours!!!!\n \n  This oven has worked very well for us.  It is great for pizzas when used with the Breville pizza pan. saves energy by not having to use the oven in the kitchen stove.\n \n  easy to operate, perfect features timer and temp. C/F settings. toasting, baking, reheating.\n \n  Great little oven. We use it every day.\n \n  It works as advertised. So far, so good.  It is an excellent toaster oven.\n ", "\n  You might consider this a \"pricy\" toaster oven, but after a month of family use, it has proved its worth. \n  The best, also identified the best by Consumer Reports this month.  I\u2019ve gotten great results on everything!\n \n  Fantastic toaster oven. I hesitated getting it because of the price.  Now that I have it, believe me it was worth the money I paid. I use it for everything, \n  This is a great toaster oven when you don't need to use a big oven and cooks just like an oven just love it\n \n  Got this on a flash sale for my parents for christmas, and they love it!\n \n  Cooks evenly!!! I use this daily and it is the best toaster oven I've ever owned. It is sturdy and durable. It's super easy to clean too. It's compact so it doesn't take up much counter space but will still hold 4 pieces of toast easily.\n \n  We've had this oven for about a month now. Nice job on toast, and convenient to see exactly how much time until your toast is done. High quality feel, as one would expect when paying close to two hundred bills, except: The two knobs have the most surprising cheap feel to them. Really light weight plastic, and lots of slop. They function fine, but I swear you'll get better feeling knobs on a $30 oven. Our only complaint, really. The crumb tray is just the easiest thing to access & clean. Makes you wonder why all toaster ovens are not made this way.\n \n  Excellent toaster over!  Breville is the Cadillac of toaster ovens bar none.  I have three and eash a different size and all work perfectly.\n \n  Wonderful toaster oven which I used as a replacement for a microwave.  The many different settings make this as easy to use as a microwave without the bad health effects.  Unfortunately, unless I am standing in front of the oven when the cooking is finished I cannot hear the finish ding.\n \n  Can't buy better\n ", "\n  I used it for tasting and broiling. Results are excellent and I highly recommend the Brevillevtiastervoven\n \n  Great product and price and super fast delivery\n \n  Expensive, but a good model. \n  JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE mine threw an error code after 2 months and is junk. The UPS guy won't pick it up and now the return window has expired. I got half of what I paid for it and it's been on my porch off and on for a week trying to get ups TO TAKE IT BACK.  get a cheap 50.00 one with convection - my new brand it hotter and half the cost.  terrible quality.\n \n  I really like this for baking a small batch of sweet potato fries and tator tots for my son, it's a quality product.\n \n  We purchased this toaster oven about six months ago and have been very pleased with it.  I love the fact that it doesn't have a noisy ringing bell. You get used to the time settings and don't even have to think about when something is ready. It is fast and includes a quality broiling pan. I would recommend this to anyone.\n \n  Toast is untoasted on top but toasted on bottom. My $10 toaster does a better job. Complete waste of money.\n \n  OUTSTABDING\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I've owned.  I was leary to pay this much for a toaster oven but after having tossed a few of the cheaper models I decided to go for it.  It toasts perfectly and it's large enough that I can bake small casseroles in it.  Well worth the money!\n \n  Rocket fast heating and cooking ", "\n  Set up oven as per instructions.  The control panel worked as indicated but NO HEAT.  Tried all setting, still no heat. Called the manufacturer: they offered to send a return label but they wouldn't ship my replacement until they received the defective one back. Then it would take 10-12 days to receive !  This, after receiving the original in one day after ordering.  I returned (for replacement) to Amazon.  It seems to me that Breville should support their so-called premium product in a better manner. (however, the customer service person was very nice & professional, and U.S. based).  Will re-rate the product once the replacement is received. \n  After having gone through 2 different toaster ovens in 2 yrs -- the last one being a Cuisinart model that actually caught fire -- this is the best oven we've had in many years. The toast and reheat functions work well, and it's great that you can vary the temp and time for reheating.\n \n  I love the controls, the way it remembers your preferred settings, how quickly and evenly it toasts/cooks, the look, how easy it is to clean, the value, and more!!!  I will always buy a Breville.\n \n  I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get one before. What a time-saver and so much faster than a big oven.\n \n  Everything tastes better than ever! Toasts everything perfectly. So far so good...\n \n  The people at America's Test Kitchen rate this at the top, and I love it.  Costs more than most of the ones you find at discount stores, but it's worth it to have quality appliances in my kitchen.\n \n  Love this oven! Toasts, bakes, broils, reheats. Prefer this over using regular oven. Worth a few more dollars for quality and versatility. Highly recommend.\n \n  Great oven. Easy to operate.\n \n  I love these toaster ovens-I just bought my 2nd one for my Florida Home.\n \n  Second one I\u2019ve owned. Use it much more than our big oven\n ", "\n  Not. As even toasting as lead to believe by American test kitchen. It may be the deference between full size one and compact one that I purchased. Other wise it is toasting better then other toasters. I have only used it as toaster so far.\n \n  I love this toaster oven.  It heats evenly, remembers what I previously set it for, easy to clean, looks great.\n \n  This was one of those, \"well-we-probably-won't-use-the-thing-very-much-but-let's-give-it-a-brief-try\" type of purchases.  I honestly can't remember using our regular oven since the Breville arrived.  It does anything our convection Jenn Air will do and it does it without heating up everything around it.\n \n  We bought after researching reviews - this was the highest rated.  It has worked very well so far - we've had it several months, and use it regularly.\n \n  Defective product! I had the oven 2 weeks bofre the oven over heated and glass shattered while cooking a pizza.\n \n  I was initially disappointed by the Breville light weight construction and its flimsy cheap-feeling controls compared to my previous Cuisinart toaster oven.  However, the Breville works well.  We love the front loading easy-to-clean crumb drawer.  My major complaint is that there is no oven rack stop mechanism to keep the easy sliding rack from coming out of the oven.  On two occasions I've ended up with the rack and my food on the floor when I pulled the rack out.  All other ovens I've used prevent the rack from sliding out.  I give the Breville an A how well it cooks, an A for easy cleaning, and a D for ergonomics and its low-quality-feel.\n \n  Consistency\n \n  Since we received this little oven, we have hardly turned on our large kitchen oven.  It works well, and doesn't heat up the house like a large oven.  Easily a 5-star build as well.\n \n  I have had this oven for about a month.  Bought it to replace a toaster oven that was too small for a pizza.  So far, it has performed as advertised.  I did not give it a perfect score because of one nit that bothers me.  The control knobs do not give the kind of feedback (feel) that I would like.  Specifically, the time/temperature knob.  For lack of a better term, I call it \"squishy.\"  When you turn it, you do not get a firm \"click-click\" from the knob. Sometimes I overshoot the desired temp or time because of this \"squishiness.\"  Hey...it is a small thing I suppose--knocking off a whole point in the rating may be a bit much but I could not give it a 5.  Otherwise, I am happy. Have made a few pizzas and baked fries and stuff like that.\n \n  Best toaster oven out there.  Worth the price!\n ", "\n  This was given as a Christmas Gift.  I spoke with them in January and they were very happy with it at that time.  Our 13 years old grandson said it was much easier to use and control the temperature than their old one.\n \n  Wish I had purchased sooner. Using it daily.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I've ever had. After owning several crappy toaster ovens, I bought this one January 2011 and it's still going strong. It has been used on a daily basis by our household (including three teenagers) to make toast, reheat pizza, and melt cheese on sandwiches. Now our kids are grown and have moved out and I'm telling my son he needs to buy his own for his home!\n \n  Good Product\n \n  Great quality, well made and cooks, re-heats better than could have imagined.  Never knew what I was missing until I bought this product.  Well worth every penny.\n \n  Very pleased with this product. Nothing to complain about.\n \n  I had a breville once before that didn't last as long as I wanted but this one is great. Size is perfect, love the three rack heights and everything about it.\n \n  Sweet unit. I'm about to do a kitchen remodel after having this for 6 months and I'm not even sweating it, this thing is very capable. The only rub is having to move the rack for different kinds of cooking but thats the same with any oven I guess.\n \n  Major upgrade from our previous Oster brand oven. Toasts evenly and heats up quick. We're using it more for quick lunches for the kids. Chicken nuggets, fish sticks, etc. High quality build.\n \n  Always love this product\n ", "\n  This is the BEST toaster oven I have ever seen or owned! It has so many settings and we particularly love the bagel setting. Toast comes out perfectly according to the settings selected. Well worth the price.\n \n  Dissatisfied with this oven because part of the bread slices I toast comes out close to being burnt, while the other part is undercooked.\n \n  I've purchased 2 cheaper toasters in the past 3 years so I decided to invest in a REAL toaster oven.  I'm very happy with the product.  It toasts evenly and cooks evenly.  It's probably too sophisticated for what I need, as I don't cook, but it's reliable to reheat leftovers or toast my bread in the morning.\n \n  Love this oven!  Perfect size for me and my countertop. So perfect for the single person. It remembers your settings so I can prepare any meal with speed and ease using multiple settings for each food item. Toast comes out perfect every time. Bakes desserts perfectly. Love it!!\n \n  Not the easiest to use compact oven out there....\n \n  Absolutely love and strongly recommend this counter top oven/toaster. It's well built and performs flawlessly! Would buy again!\n \n  This is a great toaster oven.  Browns toast really uniformly.  Controls are easy to use after a quick read of the manual.  The only drawback - when you open the door, it doesn't pull the rack out with it.  So you have to poke around (in a hot toaster) to get at your food.\n \n  Best toaster oven ever. Second one.\n \n  Knob doesn\u2019t work when trying to control the digital settings. Interior oven quality is so flimsy it could be crushed like an aluminum can in two seconds. Breville, we really cannot understand wha happened here and why we are the owners of a product that missed quality control at the factory. We received a terrible quality product. \n  it just rocks\n ", "\n  Love it!\n \n  Wife loves it but it does get a little hot.  Toast tanning a little uneven but not end of world.\n \n  Heats up quickly.  Perfect for small meals.\n \n  Excellent. We were not disappointed.  Compact and does the job well.\n \n  I love the  versatility of this oven. Toasting is easy and accurate and using the oven to bake and reheat is quite reliable. The construction is sturdy. One negative is the subtle changes in lighting between programming and \"on\" mode that sometimes leads to confusion.\n \n  What's not to like? \n  This is my second Breville.  Love it, makes great toast.\n \n  So far,  the Breville BOV650XL toaster oven works great.  Toast turns out perfect and I have made some small frozen pizzas in it .  Those turned out good as well.  The size of the oven is perfect.  I don't have any issue with the racks not moving when you open the door.\n \n  This oven is amazing it heats up quickly and cooks food perfectly. It does not heat up the entire kitchen like a regular oven. It\u2019s a great size for the kitchen cabinet. It\u2019s my go-to every chance I get.\n \n  So far so GOOD!  we ran it through all of its functions.  This Toaster oven is as described and advertised.  We just received it so we can not talk to its longevity, but it is solid and we are very happy with the purchase and the on time delivery.\n ", "\n  This compact oven preheats in just a few minutes, cooks/bakes evenly and it doesn't heat up the entire room.  The size is perfect for a smaller kitchen.  It's a solid, well-made appliance.  Very user-friendly. Would definitely recommend.\n \n  This is a great toaster oven.  Use it almost daily for toast, bagels, potatoes, vegetables and other foods.  Also, I have baked turkey legs, fish and other meats.  It is the best for me.\n \n  Wonderful oven\n \n  This thing is awesome!\n \n  Had to replace one like this after 9 yrs so got the same one. It will take a 9 by 13 dish so I do not have to use my big oven.\n \n  Best compact smart oven out there. The quality of this toaster oven is wonderful and it makes perfect toast Preheats very quickly as well.\n \n  Works great and I really like using it.\n \n  I am very disappointed in this product they do not which I thought they always did  was to offer something as simple as light and conviction like De'Longie and Cuisinart ovens\n \n  The quality of this microwave oven is not very good. It\u2019s not long before it is bought back. Generally speaking, it\u2019s not like it.\n \n  WE SIMPLY \u2764\ufe0f OUR BREVILLE TOASTER OVEN. IT\u2019S SIMPLY TOP SHELF IN EVERY WAY. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

Outside gets way too hot.The cheap CHINESE stainless started to tarnish after 5 days like my Breville Tea Pot that constantly has to be scrubbed. You have to make 4 steps to make a toast. The pre-heat makes it impossible to figure out cooking time. I made 3 small sweet potatoes at 375 degrees that took 1 hour and 20 minutes, but only 45 minutes in my old Black and Decker infrawave (which finally broke after 10 years). My friend has a Black & Decker unit that cost $99, and works better. This unit is NOT WORTH $179 at all.\n \n  High tech and an excellent oven. I don\u2019t regret this purchase. I recommended thus to a friend and he bought one too\n \n  Mom used to make toast in the broiler, butter on top, toasty edges, soft bottomed.  I could never justify turning on my giant oven for a piece or two of toast, so relied on a toaster for years.  Finally succumbed to the allure of this Breville. Mom's toast is perfect, but it's also great for reheating my spouse's dinners on late nights, baking a tiny batch of goodies, etc., without heating up the entire house. It preheats to temp quickly.  Great design and easy controls for a klutz.\n \n  Use my oven at least three times a week.  Temperature is true to the setting and so easy to use.  Love the fact that you can fit a frozen pizza.\n \n  Awesome little oven. Toasts consistently and doesn't hog a ton of real estate on my counter. Compared to the other toaster ovens I looked at, this one seems sturdy and thoughtfully designed.\n \n  I bought this compact product in order to toast, reheat, thaw bread and occasionally finish pan grilled food.  It is easy to use and the settings are very clear.\n \n  I bought this oven for my elderly mother.  She loved how it worked.  But after only 2 years of light use, it stopped working and just gave a E01 error code  (which may mean a bad transformer).  For this price, the oven should have lasted much longer.  Given the number of customer complaints (posted here and other web sites) with this same problem, the company should fix it for free.  I doubt they will and I doubt I will have the time to try to get them to stand behind their product.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven I have ever used! What else is there to say? It heats much more evenly that any I've used before. This enables you to do a few more things you wouldn't dare in a regular toaster oven.\n \n  works as advertised\n ", "\n  So easy to use and so efficient.  Amazed at how much we can bake at one time in this gem!\n \n  SMART heat element control. Perfect bagels and even toast\n \n  Love it!  Perfect size.  I was going for the Pro but have foud I really only use it for heating.\n \n  I bought this after reading the reviews on amazon and doing a bit of research. Consumer reports also listed it as one their top 3 picks for toaster ovens, and this bad boy does way more than just toast bread, bagels and pizza. It can broil, bake, and cook just about anything. It's also not too big or bulky and takes up just the right amount space as it should on the counter top. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. It's by far the Porsche of compact toaster ovens and its well worth the money. And its super easy to clean, thats probably one of the most under looked aspects of toaster ovens!\n \n  Really doesn\u2019t toast bread well. And takes forever to toast.\n \n  This thing is crazy convenient ! I don't want something that is difficult complicated options. Super easy temperature , time and start! We use it to make grill cheese saneiches for the kids. \n  I LOVE this oven. It has actually replaced the use of my normal oven. I\u2019m a single guy and it\u2019s easy to cook with! I bought this after buying one for my mom who swears by it too!\n \n  This product works as advertised.  It is compact and has a good instruction manual.  The alarm is not too loud when the toast or baking time is complete.  If it had a tray that slid out like our old toaster oven it would get a fifth star.\n \n  Very nice\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster oven! We use it daily! I would never purchase another brand. Love it so much my mom bought one too and she loves it as much as I do. Great little oven and great quality.\n ", "\n  Arrived promptly and in good condition (a gift for an important milestone).  We are quite pleased with its function -- managable footprint, reasonably intuitive operation, and useful accessories.\n \n  If you are looking for a great smaller size but still very useful oven, this is it.  It is very easy to use and easily toasts 4 slices of bread and is large enough to accommodate many sizes of dishes.  I am very impressed with this oven.  Superior quality product.  Don't pass on purchasing the bamboo cutting board/serving tray that is made to fit on top of this oven.  It fits just perfectly on top and is great as a board or tray as well.\n \n  Excellent product\n \n  We got this toaster oven for a wedding present. They have now written us twice thanking us for the gift.  They do most of their cooking in it.  We bought two more, one for each home...and we are frugal people.  My husband is a superb cook and he uses it a lot.\n \n  IT MAKES EVERYTHING GREAT!!\n \n  For baking, it is great.  It looks nice.  It is super easy to keep the crumb tray clean.  For making bread toast, it pretty much sucks.  No matter what I've tried -- and yes, this is with the rack in the toast position -- the toast comes out striped and uneven.  One of the reasons I bought this is because I wanted to make toast without babysitting it like I did with my regular toaster.  I babysit toast the same, if not more, with this Breville.  Flip one way, then another in an attempt to have a bit of all over color (toasting).\n \n  This thing works every bit as advertised. Best counter top oven we've had.\n \n  We love this toaster oven. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and very quick. Highly recommend.\n \n  The kids can make pizza without me being worries they will burn down the house!  Fast for toasting, as well.\n \n  Lots of metal all around, the cavity size is good, however I\u2019d like it a little higher to fit more pans.\n ", "\n  I own this unit for one year now. Its well made and has good features. However, its more an Oven than a toaster. If you use it as a small oven its great. IF you user this mostly to toast bread, not recommended. It takes about 3.5 minutes to toast two slices. The door seals well, so the humidity stays in the unit - good for cooking, not for toast. After 3.5 minutes toasting, you need to wait an additional minute if you want dry toast. Waiting the 4.5 minutes every morning for toast is challenging at times...\n \n  Clear digital dial, easy use.  Nice result for a small oven/toaster\n \n  We've had three other toaster ovens over the last few years and this one is the best. It toasts even and you know how long you are toasting with the count down timer. It is rated by CR as the best after it's bigger brother that has the Convection oven.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. Get the cutting board for the top to go with it.\n \n  Preheats very quickly and the timer is very accurate to directions.  Large enough for 2 individual pizzas at same time.  Warming works great for heating leftover subs without burning sub roll.  A little more than the others but worth it.\n \n  Settings are easy.  Makes great toast consistently, but not sure how efficient the bake cycle with baked potatoes.\n \n  Received new, but heating elements did not work.  Need to return.\n \n  My product has not worked from day one. Tried to return it and could never get a return label.\n \n  Purchased in October of 2014 and the bottom coil died in less than two years with a very light use (2 adults). Given the price paid, I'm disappointed.  My advice, buy a cheapo model and it will outlast the Breville.\n \n  I've had this oven for 2 years now and I am in absolute love with it.  It's compact, easy to clean and toasts to perfection.  I also use it for rehearing rather than the microwave that makes everything soggy.  I've baked cookies, casseroles and bread in this little guy and everything comes out great!!\n ", "\n  This unit is still new and I have not tested all of its options, however it is well made and the timer is great. The toast segment works perfectly and the bake function you will have to trial and error on the temperature. Other than that I recommend this unit for those who want to put their over on standby.\n \n  It frequently save using the big ovens. A most useful piece of equipment on our kitchen counter. Does make excellent toast, too.\n \n  Heats up fast, cooks evenly!\n \n  Didn't want to get this, but caved and bought if for my husband for Christmas.  I love it as much as he does.  Well worth the money.\n \n  Awesome! Can cook so many things and easy to use\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing!! Well worth the money. My husband and I debated spending this much money but now we are happy we did. Toasts quickly and quietly! You can't even tell that it's on. Our old toaster oven sounded like a ticking time bomb. This toasts evenly and I love that it tell you how long it will take. Plenty of space inside, easy to navigate and great for single pizzas. We have 2 kids and use this every day for some type of meal. It looks sharp as well!\n \n  I love it. I baked chicken and it came out so juicy, very well cooked. It's very easy to operate. Very easy to clean.\n \n  Love it, use it for everything!\n \n  Easy to use.  My 15 year son loves it.\n \n  Never thought I would use this oven as much as I do, now I couldn't live without it. Works great and is well worth the money. From fixing simple toast to baking brownies and cakes, it works great!!\n ", "\n  This oven is a high quality, reliable oven. The heating coils span over the entire top, making sure everything gets cooked uniformly. I've owned mine for 2 years and use it daily... no problems yet!\n \n  I've only used it for toast and reheating takeout food. Works perfectly so far. Toast comes out evenly done. Controls are very straightforward and it's easy to make adjustments. Crumb tray very easy to remove and clean. \n  This is a great compact toaster oven.  We were putting it on a small shelf and concerned about the width.  Fits perfectly and still large enough to bake a frozen pizza etc...  It's only been a few weeks but so far excellent product!\n \n  Well pleased with this purchase.  Compact and versatile.\n \n  Compact but multi-functional!  Food actually taste better when they are toasted to perfection!  Highly recommend!\n \n  Great!\n \n  Love this toaster oven.  I use it every day and very happy I bought it!  It's bigger than my previous one, but it still fits on my counter and looks nice.  Toast, bakes, warms nicely.  Oven heats up quickly - so much better that my big oven when I have little hungry mouths to feed fast! \n  Works as it should.  So far, have no issues with performance.\n \n  I rarely use my large gas convection oven since I bought this.\n \n  I debated whether to get the smaller, or the larger, Breville. Fortunately for me, and for the place I wanted to put it in my kitchen I choose the 650. The instruction book states you need 4\" clearance on both sides, first time I had read that critical bit of info. The 650 fits perfectly on the counter I wanted to use for it, the 800 would not have. I had also read one owner's recommendation of using a wooden spring loaded clothespin for pulling out the wire rack. I second it. It works great for that as well as for pushing the rack back in. The smaller oven may mean some changes in the sizes of what I bake but I'm certainly glad I got the 650.\n ", "\n  I purchased this oven based on other reviews. I mainly wanted it to toast and was led to believe by reviews and other consumer studies that the Breville was best for that, even though expensive. On setting 4 my toast was still white. I have to go to setting 6 to get a nice brown but still have to turn it over and give it a couple more minutes to toast the other side.  Also, the broiler pan warps in the heat and a corner pops up. Maybe I got a lemon but I didn't bother to send it back. That said, it did a great job on sausages, salmon, and roasted vegetables. I will use it instead of a big oven when cooking for two. So as a toaster, it's disappointing, but as an oven it exceeded expectations. \n  So far so good. A very nice unit at a good price.Toast even both side are evenly done . Nice looking also and we'll made.\n \n  This mini oven suits my needs to a \"T\". \n  I've had this product for 18 months and the top elements burned out.  I am chasing down the parts, but no luck yet.  Now I have a $180 toaster that only heats on the bottom.  Still looking for parts, will report back. \n  Works excellent\n \n  Love this little monster\n \n  Important addition to any kitchen\n \n  Unfortunately, if you have a newer home, this unit could be non-functional for you.  Since this unit is highly rated, I tried three (3) of these, hoping that I had received a singular defective unit.  Each unit tripped an arc-fault breaker (not the same as a GFCI breaker, which it did not trip).  Arc-fault breakers are required in most newer homes.  The latest unit I received tripped the breaker in +/- 6 seconds.  Earlier units lasted 3-4 minutes before tripping the arc-fault breaker.  The issue was confirmed by an electrician.  Arc-faults occur when the hot and neutral wires are too close together or touching. \n  it is a wonderful gift.\n \n  pretty bad-ass. more than i wanted to spend, but for form and function - well worth it. (doesn't get as volcanically hot to the touch as cheaper brands)\n ", "\n  Not any better then my 10 year old cheap one that I was using. The temperature is off by at least 25 degrees. Would not recommend that anyone buy this model.\n \n  The best toaster oven ever!  This oven is so safe, it shuts itself off even if you forget.  Don't waste your money on any other brand, it isn't worth it.\n \n  Great product. Looks nice, not too deep on the counter, controls are easy, and it toasts very evenly and consistently.  Happy toasting!\n \n  arrived on time makes better toast than my toaster removed old toaster from countertop use it for all every thing have not used Range Oven but once great for broil and frozen Pizza\n \n  What can I say except I luv luv my Breville!\n \n  Really happy with the operation of his toaster oven.  This is our first toaster oven and we mainly bought it to replace an aging toaster.  I have only had it about 45 days but so far so good!\n \n  Very good in many ways, and overall I like it a lot. The knob for fine-tuning the timed sequences, though, is VERY twitchy and really needs a design change.\n \n  It cooks everything that fits inside. Preheat and auto temperature selection are vert convenient. \n  Great Toaster oven and much more. Many different options and settings making it very versatile. Seems expensive for a toaster but well worth the price\n \n  Bought this after our old toaster oven died. This has much more functionality. There are just two of us and this can replace the oven on hot days for many things. Well made and attractive.\n ", "\n  Great looking and super easy to use. Perfect compact oven! Makes perfect toast!\n \n  Super toaster over. Great price and great delivery.\n \n  Great look and value. Use it everyday\n \n  Great oven with even temperatures for both the oven and toasting!!!\n \n  Looks good. \n  This toaster oven rates all the rave reviews.  It toasts and bakes very well.  The oven is easy to use and nice looking.  It will be several years before I know if it is worth the high price.\n \n  The controls are very easy and makes perfect toast and pizza.  There is an electronic selector to choose how many pieces of toast and how dark.  BEST toaster oven I've ever had.\n \n  This fits nicely on a crowded counter.  It\u2019s compact and does everything I needed it to to.\n \n  I've only used a few times. Makes perfect toast. Oven works great too!  So far very well pleased!\n \n  I am very happy with this product.  It seems silly to get excited over a toaster oven, but this really gets the job done.  It toasts the surface evenly leaving the inside moist and warm.  The bagel setting works perfectly.  I'm looking forward to baking with it.  It is deceptively roomy on the inside.  Definitely the best toaster I've owned.\n ", "\n  This was recommended by Christopher Kimball (America's Test Kitchen), and it works wonderfully.  Does the best toast I have ever had from a  toaster over.\n \n  Works like a charm! No problems. Got it as a Xmas present in 2011 and it's still doing fine. Controls are straightforward. The timer automatically adjusts depending on the existing temperature of the oven, something that many toaster-ovens don't do.\n \n  Not quite as simple as others I have used but it is attractive and solid and does a good job.\n \n  Size is convenient than using a big oven.\n \n  Love this little oven ... awesome for pot pies in a pinch\n \n  People I gave this gift to love this toaster oven! Performs above their expectations.Would highly recommend this product.Great deal \n  freaking best toaster oven ever\n \n  Not intuitive\n \n  I don't normally write reviews for products I've purchased, but I think the Breville 4 Slice Smart Oven is worth reviewing.  I've owned this toaster since July 2011 and it has been VERY solid.  It has many settings, but is simple to use.  The adjustable shelf is pretty handy and my wife likes the crumb tray access from the front, which makes it simple to clean.  The toaster is small, but can toast 3 bagles.  I recommend this toaster to everyone looking to buy a compact toaster with baking capabilities.\n \n  Loved this at first, cooked really well, super easy to operate. But the heating tube cracked after 3 months.\n ", "\n  This is, hands down, the best toaster oven we have ever owned -- easy to use and good results.  They packed a wide variety of features into a few elegantly simple controls.  Is your bread frozen? Press the frozen bread button and it adds just the right amount of time to the cycle to make your bread a evenly toasty brown (according to your darkness setting).  It almost seems like the toaster knows your intentions and adjusts itself to suit your tastes. Truly a smart oven.\n \n  It stays clean, somehow. I'd give it 5 stars except the user interface could be a little friendlier. So far it looks great and toasts well enough. I've only had it a few months and I haven't had a chance to use it for much else.\n \n  is smarter than I am.  Excellent product that cooks beautifully.  It think I needed something with an Element IQ.  This oven does everything.\n \n  Super toaster oven that is much more than a toaster oven.  You can bake accurately and it even does perfect toast.  Would recommend this product.\n \n  like my old one, works great, no complants\n \n  This is a fantastic product!\n \n  Very nice toaster oven. Simple to operate with the 2 knobs an selection/start button. I have made pies, cookies, casseroles, baked eggs, pizza and toast and all have come out cooked evenly and as expected.  Looks good and not too big.  Easy to clean. It does get hot on the top and it is expensive, but I am happy with mine after a month plus of use.\n \n  Bought this for my mom for Christmas 2016, she still thanks me everyday because it's a \"game-changer\" her words.\n \n  I've done them all: Oster, Black and Decker, Phillips. The list is too long to remember since I started my college days and began cooking with toaster ovens. I finally decided to step up to this Breville, and I'm pretty sure my full size oven is plotting to kill me since I never use the thing anymore. It cooks perfectly even thanks to the heating elements having sensors built in, and cleaning it is a breeze with the removable crumb tray. People scoffed at me for spending this much on a toaster oven, but I'm pretty sure I'll never need another, and it's just so easy to use.\n \n  Our toaster oven died and I ended up buying this one.  I would have sent this one back; however, I threw the box away immediately.  Accordingly, I had to learn how to use it.  Rather than dislikes, I'll list wishes:  \u2022  I wish it had an off/on button.  Early on, I unplugged it every time I used it.  I think owners should have a way of knowing that the oven is off immediately.  \u2022 I wish this oven were intuitively  obvious.  I've had several toaster ovens and I have never had to take time to learn how to use one; e.g., toasting bread should be easy to do and not require learning how to do it and then have to explain it to other household members.  \u2022  I wish the rack had a stop setting, so it did not come out completely and possibly burn someone.  \u2022 I wish there were better information about placement for broiling.  The suggested placement for broiling is (in my opinion) too close to the top.  \u2022  I wish it were a bit wider, so it could hold a 5\"x7\" pan.  That said, I have gotten used to it -- except for broiling (which was so easy in my previous toaster oven) and having to preheat.  I really liked being able to put fish in immediately and have them done right away.  Now it takes longer.  My other one was a lot less expensive and lasted for years.  I miss it.\n ", "\n  Best toaster oven we have every owned.  Simple to use controls\n \n  This makes the best toast ever... Bagels too. It is easy to use and adjust settings. Love it!\n \n  This one was a gift but I have it as well (and the Bamboo Cutting Board for the top, ordered separately).  It's great for so many items when you don't want to turn on a full size oven, or for me when I wished I had a double oven but don't.\n \n  I love this toaster oven! Everything comes out perfect\n \n  Kinda expensive for a toaster.\n \n  Good product.  Good deal.\n \n  Well built product\n \n  This oven cooks and bakes better than my expensive Kitchen Aid Convection full sized stove. I bake cookies & brownies several times a week, reheating pizza is amazing using the TOAST function. I make Nachos, bake chicken, there is nothing I would hesitate to cook in my oven. High quality stainless, pull out crumb catcher making it always easy to keep clean. I found extra baking glassware & bakeware to fit the oven size. The cooking temperatures are exact. LOVE, love, love it. I have one in both my kitchens, upstairs & downstairs in the big kitchen.  Buy one and see!\n \n  Really enjoy this oven, was more than others, but cooks more evenly than my other ovens.  Top does get hot on the outside, so beware, don't leave something on top when on.\n \n  Love it. Much faster than the older one and I like the preheat and other advantages ir has.\n ", "\n  We have had another brand of toaster oven for years and years. We were limping along because the last one wasn't but a couple years old, but it had never worked well. My teenager and I LOOOVE this toaster. It's easy to use, it's attractive, it toasts and heats and broils beautifully, quickly and consistently. I can fit most of what I cook in it. I am disappointed when I have to use my regular oven because, although it works fine, this is a superior oven. Whenever one of us uses it, we always say, \"I love this toaster. I am in love with this toaster.\" Another tip, get a little pair of bamboo tongs to pull things out, and you'll never burn your fingers again!\n \n  Very versatile and found myself using it for much of my heating up, toasting and baking small items.  Has good function for use and easy to clean.\n \n  I've had this toaster oven for six months. Its a great design and the control logic is simple and very intuitive. Its sleek and elegant and worth every penny for its functionality. It works consistently each and every time. There are no cheap parts. I would buy again and highly recommend. Excellent product.\n \n  THE NON-STICK INTERIOR IS FANTASTIC!!\n \n  Handy.\n \n  Nice sized unit for office environment. Love the 10 minute shut-off feature.  No more worries of fire.\n \n  Awesome toaster oven.  I have used it more in one week than I have used my oven in a month.  Easy to use and easy to clean.\n \n  The Best oven money can buy.\n \n  very accurate and great for toasting, broiling, baking, pizza, etc\n \n  Worth the price\n ", "\n  Love it. Works as expected and more. Wish I had bought one years ago. You will not be disappointed. It was worth the extra money.\n \n  Wish we had purchased earlier. Worth every penny. If you need a toaster oven this is the one to get.\n \n  Love how this oven cooks! Had it for 6 months and have no complaints in that department.  It preheats quickly, cooks just like a conventional oven, and toasts beautifully. Made pizza, cooked sides, etc and no problems. Drawbacks...the only issue is the grate that you can move in order to get things in and out of the oven.  There is no catch in the back when pulling it out and I have on various occasions had the grate fall out and create a great big mess.  Basically means you have to be careful with it and even when doing so you will probably still make a mess occasionally when in a hurry.\n \n  Very dependable-\n \n  I used revews on toaster ovens to purchase this one. We were tired of the black and decker ovens from the local department stores, wtih timers that stop working and heating elements going bad. So far this oven works and looks great!! The construction is so much better, it should last for decades.\n \n  This oven is perfect for us.  The controls are easy to use and the large digital read out is great.  It toasts perfectly and is perfect for baking eggplant Parm and many other tasty dishes.\n \n  Compact oven that works like a larger oven.  It is very efficient and accurate.\n \n  Excellent, user friendly, and very well made.\n \n  Already had one, used for several years and love it.  Bought another for a second house.\n \n  Yes, it is expensive and big.  But its size and power allow it to sub, in many instances,  for the wall oven which heats up the kitchen.  Not good in August.  Does all the ordinary things very well - like toast, top browning, reheating, etc.  The large capacity allows for 8 x 10 baking dish or 12\" pizza.  Good for heating dinner plates. Can handle an Italian bread without burning the top.  Instructions and controls are clear and easy to use.  Settings have plenty of user variations and adjustments to accommodate a wide variety of situations.  Good visibility of contents while cooking.  Feels sturdy and well made.  Worth the extra money.\n ", "\n  I bought this oven for my studio, and it fits very well. It also cooks very well! My first meal in this oven was a cordon bleu and the chicken came out moist in the middle with the cheese and ham not burnt. The functions are great and easy to play with!! It heats up very fast and did I mention the design is awesome? One of my favorite investments to my studio and is total worth the money.\n \n  satisfactory toaster oven\n \n  The heat from the oven melted the cord - make sure you have enough space on the counter.\n \n  High quality, easy to clean\n \n  Well put together product from removable crumb tray below to a warmer on top.\n \n  Third try with toaster ovens and finally found one that works like it should !\n \n  It works very well and also looks good. Many I looked at were larger, including the cuisinart which would have replaced my current cuisinart. This is very roomy, holds as much as my old 6 slice machine. I was not happy with the old cuisinart, it should have lasted much longer than it did.\n \n  Fast and easy to use\n \n  This is the one.  Perfect. The only thing I'd add is an interior light.\n \n  Quick & easy to use\n ", "\n  Easy to use and perfect for my kitchen\n \n  Excellent product.

Had 4 toast total. Top even, bottom not so much but tasted great. the removable tray is great. Top gets hot so i would recommend the bamboo cutting board or a generic wood board\n \n  We love our toaster oven!\n \n  Worked great for the first month then just stopped turning on. Breville replaced this defective toaster and the replacement lasted approximately two months before doing the same thing. I ruled out any electrical issues on my end--this is an expensive, beautiful, piece of junk. Now I'm stuck demanding restitution from Breville as I'm not interested in a third defective toaster for nearly $200. Conversely, the $12 Black & Decker toaster over I bought used at a thrift store continues to work great after 5+ years!\n \n  This oven rocks, best one of many Ive owned. perfect toast, bakes well including cookies.\n \n  This is a great versatile appliance - great toaster, oven, etc .  Less expensive alternatives leave too much to be desired.\n \n  I love my oven. It\u2019s all I use now. I highly recommend it.\n \n  Cheap product and the trays don't even fit in the oven.\n ", "\n  We like it.  The exterior does get HOT.  That is a caution to  all those that buy this. I guess if we was to do it over my wife would want the bigger one.\n \n  Have had one of these before & really like this brand!  Fast ship!\n \n  Great quality\n \n  I ordered this for a home that was being re-built after a fire so I didn't open it until Jan 2015 when the home was ready.  It had a huge very obvious  dent on the  right side and the glass in the front door had slid out of the frame and was sitting on the counter! It was too late to return it so I threw away an item costing more than $140!!!  BEWARE USED ITEMS WITH LIGHT COSMETIC DAMAGE!!\n \n  As of right now happy withthid\n \n  I wish I knew this toaster is available long time ago. \n  It fits perfectly on my counter, is nice to look at and it toasts and bakes to perfection. Never have to worry about burning anything. I can even time the rest of what I am cooking around what I have in the Breville because it counts down the time to completion. You get what you pay for. I love it!\n \n  Alerts do not function properly: faintly audible. five paces away it cannot be heard: have been thru 3 of them and they are all the same; talked to the reps in California and they agree; they suggest I contact Amazon for an adjustment. Nice of them! A lot of money to pay for something that does not meet expectations.\n \n  So much better than a microwave for many family kitchen needs.\n \n  Execellant product. We have always purchased the cheap toaster ovens. However, we were watching toaster oven reviews on a popular cooking show and the Breville brand did very well, and ended up being their choice. So, we decided to purchase one, and it has turned out to be a fantastic product. As an example, perfect toast. Also, very easy to use.\n ", "\n  Cancelled item and was returned as advertised.\n \n  I am thrilled with this Toaster oven.  For years I have had to battle having to toast bread several times, and getting burnt edges, etc.  Toast is picture perfect, toasted crunchy, and find the digital setting easy to use and the instructions very easy to understand. Also like the idea of preset temperature for the oven.  Although a little pricey find it was well worth the investment. \n  I had the same toaster oven for a few years and loved it, so when it stopped working I was so very upset. I liked it so much I had to get another one. I use it for everything, not just toast.\n \n  tried many over the years but nothing has performed like this one/\n \n  Size is comparable to a microwave. Solid for cooking almost anything.\n \n  Yes, it was expensive but far superior to the inexpensive toaster ovens that I've been buying every couple of years. It feels solid, the door closes quietly, and best of all it cooks evenly. I like how you can change the settings to suit your own preferences. The size is just right: not too big, not too small. I expect this oven will last for many years.\n \n  Easy to use with solid attractive build.\n \n  Perfect size for my tiny kitchen! The roasting function is awesome! Chicken comes out golden and crispy!\n \n  Easy to use.\n \n  Seriously best oven ever. Period.\n ", "\n  Title should say it all - but many of these Breville will show up in an Amazon search for \"convection toaster oven\" when they should not. \n  I love it.  All toasting is done to perfection.  Reheating is good. \n  GOOD\n \n  Great product, no complaints\n \n  good\n \n  This thing might be a good toaster, but it's a lousy oven.  I can't tell you how many things I've tried to cook and they never seem to be done.  Have to practically double the time.  Sure it's light, and not hard to use, but I can't rely on it, so I don't.  Regret buying it.\n \n  Love it- especially awesome in the summer because I rarely have to turn on our big oven!\n \n  Love my toaster oven.\n \n  Great best choice ever \ud83e\udd70\n \n  I so love my toaster oven!\n ", "\n  Works great, use instead of oven whenever possible.\n \n  Very nice appliance! Lots of choices for cooking, toasting, and baking. It bugs me a little that the light stays on for 10 minutes before going out, but I love the little finger pull to unplug it if I want. That might be safer anyway.\n \n  Total garbage. Non-functional out of the box. Immediately returned.\n \n  Everything I was looking for... only negative is the door slams shut, does not stay open easily... \n  This is just what I wanted and more.  Quality craftsmanship. Perfect for my small apartment.  Cooks beautifully.\n \n  Super nice product!\n \n  This toaster oven makes great toast as well as bake small quantities.  It doesn't heat up the kitchen in hot weather.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. We received it as promised.\n \n  At first little apprehensive, after I found what selection suited my preference for example I use pizza to reheat not reheat which takes to long, I am very happy.  I make my own selections not necssarily that correspond with what the dial shows.  Love it!\n \n  Perfect size for two people's cooking.  Small enough to fit in my pantry closet but large enough for most of my baking needs.\n ", "\n  Es muy descomplicado\n None \n  I like this oven a lot. Not a whole bunch of fancy bells and whistles.\n \n  Really nice unit so far.  Thoughtfully designed and easy to use.  Heats things quickly too.\n \n  Love this oven.  I'm impressed in how evenly it toasts.  Everytime my husband uses it he says \"this is a great toaster oven.\"  It's a little pricey for the average consumer (me) but well worth it.  I haven't used the other features enough to comment on.  It's a nice size, not too big.\n \n  This  is a great toaster oven.  So many settings.  English muffins toast perfectly.\n \n  We love this toaster oven, it is well made and works very well. You should get it.\n \n  This oven does exactly what I wanted.....I use this for cooking smaller meals and reheating certain foods that I do not want to use the microwave or the full sized oven.\n \n  Very easy to use\n \n  nice toasts really good i like it alot\n \n  I finally have found the toaster oven I have been searching for. Consistency of taosting has been a big issue with other toaster ovens. With the Breville once you find the setting you like...set it and then you only have to push the on button from there on in. Expensive yes...worth it yes, yes!\n ", "\n  This is the best toaster/oven I have ever purchased.  it makes beautiful toast, broils well and great for baking, does not heat up the kitchen!!\n \n  LOVE THIS TOASTER OVEN.  Got one for myself and for each of my kids. Even heating for all functions.  Very easy to keep clean.  Great design.\n \n  Works perfectly and looks nice with our stainless steel appliances.  Easy to clean crumb tray. \n  Best toaster oven ever. Have purchased three to give.\n \n  The hands down best oven on the market...we own two of the standard size and gave this as a wedding gift.\n \n  Top of the line and price but love it.  Returned a weaker model for this one.  No regrets.\n \n  Nothing can compare to this brand.\n \n  Bought for the wife, but I use it everyday...... very powerful...\n \n  Needed a new toaster oven and saw great reviews for this one.  Accomodates 4 very large slices of bread and is very easy to use unlike our last toaster oven.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because all I've made in it so far is toast.  I doubt that I'll ever use it for cooking a chicken or cookies, but it sure works well and is easy to clean.\n \n  Love it, works well, easy to operate, and had no problems so far.\n ", "\n  Seldom do I get to say that a product exceeded my expectations.........but this oven went well beyond my hopes. For once, you can have a toaster oven that matches true temperature settings with a full=size oven.\n \n  Simply the very best!\n \n  Gave our daughter our 15 year old Krup toaster oven to take back to college.  Our research and spending more for the Breville, so far was a good decision.  We have used many of its functions since Christmas and feel we made an excellent purchase.  It's multi function controls have come in handy and it is relatively easy to operate.  Have been using it for more cooking then the Krup instead of our Wolf gas stove, so far it is passing all cook tests.\n \n  Excellent product..worth the cost.  Its a true mini oven.\n \n  After having thrown out many a toaster ovens in my lifetime, this one to me delivers the best toast of all. \n  Great product! Highly recommend!\n \n  I love this michine it works great.\n \n  Have been using this toaster oven for about a month and am very satisfied with its performance. Seems well built and intelligently designed. The high tech finish goes well in a contemporary kitchen. We chose the smaller model because it takes up less counter space and we don't feel at all compromised.\n \n  Works great for even toasting.  Love the slide out tray for cleaning. Would purchase this brand again. Much better than the B&D I had before.\n \n  Breville offers several sizes of this toaster oven. This one is perfect as you can easily fit four slices of toast, but it isn't taking up too much space on the counter. The ability to set the number of slices to control the heating is nice. Settings are accurate and haven't faded over time. ", "\n  The best thing about the oven is there isn't anything really bad about it. It toasts adequately and pretty evenly (a real plus!), which is what I use it for. The downsides are: 1. Unnecessarily complicated to set, and 2. Oven tray does not come out as the door opens. Overall, compared to the many toasters we have had (and not liked), it is a keeper, and I recommend it.\n \n  This unit is awesome.\n \n  Arrived quickly, my son uses it all the time and is happy with it.\n \n  It's fine, but like most of these things, it's not a great toaster - one side comes out fine, but the other is stripey. Won't die from it, but it's no better than our old one for toasting.\n \n  We have sold countless toaster ovens in garage sales, and threw others away outright.  Our daughter-in-law had one of these on her counter that we used a few times and we decided to buy one for ourselves.  It is the only toaster oven I know of that makes all sorts of toast perfectly.  The oven and other features work great as well.  We also bought the Breville bamboo cutting board which sits on top and allows us to set stuff on top of the oven.  The only similar products that we thought may have worked as well were convection-styled ovens; but they were all much larger and would have taken over too much counter space.  This Breville was the perfect solution.  It has been problem free.\n \n  I had my old toaster oven for decades, but finally felt I needed to replace the thing.  Needless to say, I suffered significant sticker shock when I saw the price of the Breville, but the glowing reviews convinced me to go for it.  And I love it.  It looks good on the counter (and it will be on the counter - it is too big to stash away in the cabinet) and does it all -- and does it well.  It's well constructed and has a modern look, but a sturdy feel to all its components.  I threw away the stand alone toaster I had purchased because the old toaster oven \"didn't do toast.\"  The Breville does, and does it well.  It also does a great job of roasting, baking, broiling, and reheating.  During hot summer days, it makes a great alternative to starting up the big oven, because it is large enough to manage good sized portions.  The front-empty crumb tray is a great improvement. \n  The best does it all welk\n \n  Gave it as a gift, it did not heat up, sent it back\n \n  Liking it more all the time\n \n  perfect oven\n ", "\n  Great size. Find I use it more and more. Does not heat up the whole kitchen. Perfect toast\n \n  This smart oven is incredible. Toasts bagels to perfection. Reheats pizza without burning the crust. It is expensive, but should last for years. Worth every penny, in my opinion. I had the $100 Kitchen Aid countertop oven prior to this and was never that happy with it. The Breville is the only one I'm buying from now on.\n \n  Because I use my toaster oven more than any other appliance in my kitchen. I really wanted a quality product and this is it! At first it was hard to justify spending that kind of cash when I could go to Macy's and get a black and decker for $19.99, but you get what you pay for. \n  Wonderful toaster oven!  We use it so many ways and it looks so good on our kitchen counter.\n \n  Bought it for my elder mother & she loves it Great little oven for one! Nice to look at, easy use, good investment.\n \n  After two months, the Breville is great for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids).  The oven functionality is wonderful, the display and settings are easy to use even for my young kids.  The big test will be its longevity.\n \n  We got this toaster oven to replace several disappointing cheap ones.  We decided to go for an expensive one and see if it performed any better.  We have had it for about two months. \n  Makes really delicious food!\n \n  Does a great job.  Going to buy another\n \n  The toaster works good and is lareger than a 4 slices. It works good as an oven too. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the nob for adjusting the temp/tine is a little sensitive and doesn't feel super quality.\n ", "\n  Great oven. Bought it to replace my microwave.\n \n  I usually have gotten the black and decker brand throughout the years, in college, through my 20's. But now I am married, we just bought a house and I decided to splurge. It was worth it. You don't think there is a difference but the precision of this thing does make a difference. I am not a guy that nromally writes reviews but I have benefitted so much from others I decided to. If you ar eon the fence and can afford it, I think it is worth it. Only open question to me does the item have the longevity of Black and Decker. The jury is out ther ebut from the glowing reviews I think so. I sort of think Black and Decker is like Ikea and this is like Crate and Barrel or William Sonoma. I love it so far.\n \n  The best\n \n  Great, compact bake oven!\n \n  Absolutely love it.  It took the place of my old toaster oven and toaster.  Easy to use .  Cooks great.  Fantastic brand.\n \n  I loved this smart oven while it worked.  Today it quit--4 years old!  Now we read that there is a $4 part that fails..  What a shame.  Shame on you Breville!  We are really disappointed and unable to replace that part....We will not buy another Breville product since they do not use quality parts throughout!\n \n  Best toaster I've owned\n \n  Excellent !!!\n \n  We liked the first one we bought so much that we bought another for our summer cottage. Unlike other toaster ovens I have used in the past, it is capable of being an excellent toaster and oven both. Bagels or steaks come out great.\n \n  Perfect size for a smaller Kitchen and works very well.\n ", "\n  Just up and died! I've had it for five years, used it regularly, not over much. Tried to turn it on and nothing. No light, no sound, nothing. It's dead. Tried other outlets, fuses, other things on the circuit work fine. Of course I can't return it but you'd think a toaster like this would just keep going. Switching back to the Black & Decker one I had before. That thing will probably last longer than me...\n \n  Purchased it in November. I use my Breville at least 4 to 5 times a week. The controls and settings are easy to use, however it does take some learning to reach the desired texture on toast, bagels, etc (as expected with any new electronic equipment). Yes they seem loose but I am not concerned with there integrity, it seems like they were designed that way.  I have used it for toasting, baking and broiling. I am very pleased with the toasting and baking however the broil function is below the rating that CR reported, it is not average. It does not darken the food enough even at long time durations.  I broil frequently so I am disappointed with that setting. I am back using my oven for that feature.  If you are looking for a broiler this unit is not for you.\n \n  Have not tried all features but toaster is great\n \n  This toaster oven is very well built and heats very well.  What we have baked has turned out beautifully...kudos!! Toasts well.  I cannot figure out how to turn the darned thing off after cooking without unplugging it.  Also, if I had it to do over again, I most likely would have purchased the larger version, as I have the counter space and do a lot of cooking that could be done in the larger oven.  I do think that they could have thrown in a second rack...geez, when you consider the price!!!\n \n  Very specific controls make for a good outcome all the time\n \n  This is a great toaster---perfectly cooks toast, bagels, and English muffins, but more than that it's an easy to use mini oven. I've used it for baked fish, pork tenderloin, and vegetables. We use it everyday, and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.\n \n  I have the larger of this oven and have no issues with that product. Liked so much, I ordered this as a gift as a replacement for the old version of an oversized bread toaster. This product is used more than the oven, and works flawlessly. One of the best purchases made.\n \n  Well built, cooks beautifully! My only criticism would be the wire shelf doesn't pull out when you open the door.\n \n  Just got the Breville a couple months ago and started using it immediately. It is everything we wanted and more. So easy to use and it bakes and broiled as good as any compact oven we've ever had.\n \n  My family loves this toaster oven.  So far everything I have made turns out perfect.\n ", "\n  very hot surface outside sides and top when oven is on, its very unsafe,there is no double wall ,i had  one cheep one from target about $40,and was double wall,and did not get that hot outside for years,then we decided to upgrade our kitchen..,and we send it back .\n \n  The toaster is unlike any other models i have used before.  The temp is accurate. Turns off automatically, no burnt toasts in the morning.  Yay! \n  The oven does just what it is supposed to do.  Cook food.  I works great, I have reheated food, boiled, baked, etc.  I am very happy and would recommend and buy it again.\n \n  It's not a toaster... it,s a real oven and a great one!\n \n  I replaced a more expensive KitchenAid toaster oven with this Breville unit. Its design and electronic controls put to shame the more well-known brand that had mechanical controls that failed less than a year after purchase. The Breville toaster oven is the best toaster oven I've ever used.\n \n  I was disappointed with trying to get the tempeture right. It was on the hottest (7) and still didn't toast my bread. I thought the oven door closed with a magnet but doesn't. For the price I am not satisfied. Would not recommend it.\n \n  This toaster oven is terrific.  I have used it for baking, broiling and making pizza.  For pizza, I purchased the Breville pizza pan.  Could not be happier with the purchase.  Timing is automatic on some settings which takes a little getting used to but that is the case with any new item beyond an on and off switch.\n \n  best toaster oven ever!  easy to use, easy to clean, looks great on the counter.\n \n  Outstanding product... compact, well-designed and of extremely high quality. Precise temperature control, and all those individual settings aren't just for show, either;  each one really does correspond - through differences in temperature, which heating elements are in use, and the length of time they cycle on and off - to the food item being prepared.  Great results across the board... by far the best toaster oven I've ever owned.\n \n  Love it.  Cooks everything perfect and is so easy to use.\n ", "\n  Took it a while to get used to it but now we've had it for about 6 months we love it.\n \n  Exactly what I wanted!\n \n  I use it as my only kitchen oven.  The Breville meets my requirements for size, convenience of use and performance.\n \n  Love it...... meets all needs!\n \n  Very good product but should be lower priced.\n \n  We live on a boat so space is very limited. Was challenge cooking everything on a BBQ or in microwave. Really missed having an oven for broiling and baking. This \"toaster oven\" is perfect. Looks very good so we can leave it on counter. Have not used it for toast yet, but it's really good for baking casseroles and broiling meat. No complaints. Highly recommend.\n \n  This oven far surpasses all the $30 ones I have had.  It is worth every penny.  I hardly use my really OLD apartment oven now.  This oven is amazing........it cooks evenly, bakes great, NO complaints at all.  All is great with this oven, even toast  : ) LOVE it!!\n \n  I liked this toaster oven a great deal.  However, at only 3-1/2 years old the bottom two heating elements have failed.  I assume it's an electronics problem, as they both failed at the same time.  They do not work on any setting at all.  It is an incredible hassle to take something like this into a repair shop, and requires too much time out of work, so I will probably simply replace it, but I am too reluctant to try another Breville.  I have a second Breville in another house that hasn't failed yet, but it gets much less use.  We used this one every day, both for toasting and as a small oven.\n \n  Good\n \n  Excellent!\n ", "\n  You pay for what you get. Wife uses this so much the old stove is just storage for pots and pans now.\n \n  I'm a modest guy so I only have a few top quality items. But the few I do are really right up there - a custom-made titanium bike for example. And this Breville is right there with it. I look for ways to use it each evening, it's that fantastic.\n \n  down side of product is that bread toasts only on one side.  you need to remove toast, turn it over to get the other side toasted. easy to clean,  a great way to prepare salmon filets.\n \n  I was very happy with this toaster oven.  We used it cook frozen foods and toast.  It worked great for 26 months and then suddenly just stopped working.  I would expect a \"premium\" priced toaster oven to last longer then two years.  If you are going to have to replace the toast every 2 years, you might as well buy a cheaper one.\n \n  It is very easy to clean.  The controls are easy to work and it does a good job.\n \n  Best toaster oven I have owned and I've owned several before this one.  Thanks.  I appreciate the opportunity to give input.\n \n  great\n \n  Maybe the controls are not the most intuitive, but we are very happy with the results.  My husband claims it toast the perfect bagel.\n \n  Best Toaster Oven I have ever used!!\n \n  Excellent toaster oven.  Easy to use and works really well.\n ", "\n  Love it.\n \n  This Breville is head and shoulders above any toaster oven we've ever had. Workmanship seems very good and the controls are intuitive and easy to use. The toast is the best we've ever had from any machine.The baking temperature checks exactly the same as our gas range. I baked a cake, one half in the range and the other in the Breville, and they came out identical. How well it will stand up to long term use I don't know. I do have two complaints. The outer case gets very hot, don't touch in without protection, and the alarm that the cycle is finished should be louder. I would still recommend it to anyone if they are willing to pay the price.\n \n  We've had a month plus and so far it works fine.  Better than the old one.\n \n  This toaster over its fantastic......many settings large interior and easy to clean crumb/drip tray pulls right out like a drawer in front.....no need tolift  or tilt it. I highly recommend this. I love it\n \n  This is the most reliable, easiest to clean, best toaster over in any price range.  It does muffins, toast, and bagles perfectly.\n \n  Love it\n \n  Reviews were excellent and having used it for several weeks, we understand why. Love the product, grateful to those who took the time to comment.\n \n  Best compact oven I ever owned. Lives up to all the positive reviews.\n \n  I heats way too much on the surface (outside).\n \n  Time saver and convenient. Good addition to my cooking. Saves on power bill\n ", "\n  Just the right size to fit under my counters and very easty to use.  Just remember to peel off the covering from the menu plate and away you go.\n \n  Admittedly a re-furb, and very pleased with it, but it doesn't toast as evenly as it it might.\n \n  We love this toaster oven ! \n  Love it.  Keeps the kitchen cooler in the summer vs an oven\n \n  Very good product.\n \n  This if the first review I have ever written for a product - but I feel I must warn others.  I just bought the Breville Compact Smart Oven because the positive reviews outweighed the negative ones.  I thought - oh that must have just been a fluke oven they received.  Certainly, a company that makes an oven with such rave reviews would have good quality control and a good product, right?  How could they stay in business if they didn't?  Well I was mistaken.  After only three weeks use, the top heating element will no longer come on and I have a one-sided toaster - the same issue that several other reviewers have reported.  I am returning this oven and NOT requesting a replacement.  It is a piece of junk. I am convinced now that they are incapable of making  a good quality toaster oven anymore.  That is why I spent more money on this one and expected it to perform better and longer than this.  I am resorting back to the $40 models so if they do break, I am not out too much money.  It is too bad because I did like the oven itself and the features and ease of use.  Of all the things we can do in this world today it is baffling as to why someone cannot make a good toaster oven.  I am just glad that mine bit the dust before the 30 days was up so I can return it, unlike others that this happened to months later and they have had a hard time getting it resolved.\n \n  Works great.  Like having the crumb tray in front for easy emptying.  Use it for everything.  Toast, pizza, roasted potatoes, bread, warming things.  Heats quickly.\n \n  I've had our toaster oven for about a month now and just love it. It toast evenly and true to what you set it. If you like things a little darker set it to a 5 and you will darker toast. a light toast and a 3 or 4 is perfect. It's great to turn a cold lunch sandwich into a warm toasted treat by just putting on brown top and it fantastic. It looks terrific on the cabinet and cleans up very easy. I haven't used it to bake yet based on all the things I have done I have high expectation. \n  a+++ excellent purchase\n \n  Looks great, works great!  I would recommend this to everyone I know.  Well worth the price.  BUY IT!!!!!  Nothing more I can say.\n ", "\n  Great! It was just perfect every time\n \n  Awesome product.  Built well and works very well.\n \n  I use this toaster oven every day for toast and the toast is perfect.  It  is great to use as an oven also...I don't need to use my big oven very often.\n \n  PERFECT!\n \n  Very happy with my oven works well not to little and not to big just right. Its an nice addition to my stainless steel kitchen appliances. Best buy ever !!!\n \n  I just wish the tray came out when the door opens.\n \n  Easy to use. Toasts  and bakes beautifully. Don't need my big oven!\n \n  We have had the unit only a few weeks, but so far we are very pleased.  The precision of this oven is far better than the cheap Black and Decker units we have lived with for way too long.  We decided to take the plunge into a higher grade toaster oven having one thing or another break down after a year or two with the B and D's.  We have NO regrets to date.\n \n  Keeps temperature amazingly well. It showed up my regular oven! Love it. One improvement would be if the rack pulled out when you opened the door.\n \n  I really like this oven.  Well made. Very versatile. Evenly cooks.  Faster better option than conventional oven for most dishes.  The broil feature is my only minor complaint.  It isn't hot enough.\n ", "\n  I am totally pleased with this appliance.  It has worked perfectly and I would recommend it.\n \n  This is an outstanding toaster oven. Works beautifully for every function, is easy to use, looks polished, feels professional (read: not made of clanky, cheap metal parts).\n \n  Only had the oven for a month but is meeting all expectations at this time\n \n  The quality of this product is apparent from the moment you open the box.  This \"toaster' belongs proudly displayed on the counter. Excellent energy and time saving option to the main stove / oven for most cooking, baking & toasting.\n \n  Use it everyday - even threw away my toaster!\n \n  Excellent, but a little complicated for me.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven we ever had. The only slight gripe is that it's a little difficult to use. You have to remember or lookup where to put the tray based on what you want to do. But the results are well worth it.\n \n  I love how easy it is to adjust the darkness of anything I toast.  I can adjust my what I'm toasting and how many slices as well as how dark I want it. A perfectly toasted piece of bread is just a turn of the dial away.\n \n  Overall it is a nice toaster oven. However, it toast bread unevenly.\n \n  Love it! Great looking and works great too!\n ", "\n  Use it daily; love it.\n \n  This Breville BOV650XL Compact Smart Oven 1800-Watt Toaster Oven with Element IQ toaster meets all of my expectations.  I would buy it again.\n \n  It works well, but it is overpriced for what it does.\n \n  I have one, love it so I bought my mom one.\n \n  So far, I've used it as one very expensive toaster; however, I plan to try cooking meats and fish in it as the summer progresses.\n \n  great works as advertised !!\n \n  Well worth the extra money.\n \n  I bought this toaster oven in Jan 2011. Yesterday it shorted out internally sending a burnt rubber smell throughout the house. A one year warranty is terrible for a product at this price. I am single so it didn't get that much use. I was overall satisfied with it except it did not toast the toast on the underside at all. \n  Excellent toaster oven! Perfect size! I don't really use my regular oven anymore. This is more accurate and cooks everything to perfection\n \n  I love this oven! So far I've only cooked bagels and broiled fish, but it's cooked everything perfectly!\n ", "\n  Nice design, nicely packaged.  The newly arrived unit is not usable. The timer/warning/signal function does not work.\n \n  Just like having a second oven in my kitchen!  Easy enough for my kids and even my husband to use.\n \n  I was replacing an \"antique\" toaster oven and had no idea how wonderful they are now.  I read the reviews on CR and comments from users and found the best buy on Amazon.  So glad I read others comments as the Breville is a dandy!\n \n  I have the next size up as well, it has nice features such as little magnets that pull out the grill when the door opens.  Would be 5-stars if this type of feature was carried over to the smaller oven.  Otherwise, it's a fantastic toaster oven.\n \n  fantastic \n  I love that it tells me where to put the toaster, broiler, baker rack. I love it that it lets me pick how dark I want my toast. It is just the right size and my wife uses it.... instead of the oven. Great product, Breville!\n \n  I did some research and finally decided on this toaster oven and my wife and I really like it. It's compact but powerful and heats quickly. I saw some comments that it does not toast evenly but I find that it works very well when set correctly for either toast and bagels. Great replacement for our old toaster oven.\n \n  Been using this for a year now. Absolutely love it.\n \n  I got the same results with my Black and Decker toaster only, costing $39.  I thought that with 1800 watts, it would broil perfectly.  They only thing it worked good for was toasting bread and baking cookies.\n \n  I wanted my kids to have a great toaster but something doesnt work after only a year.  Much too much money for it to breakdown that fast.I thought I was doing a good thing because I have never had a good toaster myself.  I just got one that was under $20 and wouldn't you know, its the! best one I ever had\n ", "\n  My husband and I have gone through countless toaster ovens over the years.  It seems like we get used to one and it stops working so I go to the department store and get another.  This time I decided I was trying something completely different.  After lots of research and comparisons we chose the Breville brand.  It's perfect.  We can be the true testers for toaster ovens because we use it every day two to three times.  So far, so good!  We love it!\n \n  Very easy to use, the various  settings seem very accurate, looks good on the counter\n \n  It's OK. It makes good toast, its sort of hard to find pans that fit. The dial settings are hard to read. It looks a bit fancier than my last oven which makes my wife happy but I miss my old one that would hold a full size frozen pizza\n \n  Up to date but not complicated to use.  I am very happy with results so far.  I have done bagels and broiled hamburgers and I  like it very much. Love the plate warmer feature.\n \n  The product is very efficient and easy to use. We have been using it daily since receiving it at Christmas and it performes extremely well. We would reccomend this appliance to everyone.\n \n  My wife and I have not had this very long, but we both find it very useful.\n \n  This is my first toaster oven.  I love it thus far.  Easy to use.  Quiet.\n \n  Best little oven I have had!\n \n  Just right for our needs - toast, english muffins, frozen waffles, and bagels. It is easy to operate, and nice to look at as appliances go.\n \n  Easy to use and makes great toast.\n ", "\n  This is not your mother's toaster oven. It is much more advanced and works well. I can choose between many options. I can choose the number of items I want to toast and the degree of done-ness. I have also used it to bake a 9\" X 9\" pan of brownies without having to heat up my entire full sized oven. I would recommend this to someone looking for a toaster oven.\n \n  Died (electrically dead, no display, no heat) after 12 months of use.  Failed while making toast.  Powered by an outlet through a quality surge supressor during its entire short life.  Good while it lasted but obviously faulty engineering design.  Five stars while it worked but would expect to get at least five years of use.  One star for one year.\n \n  Worked great for one year for regular household use, but just outside the warranty period it now displays an \"E05\" error code and will not allow you to use it.  Further the manufacturers website does not provide any information on what the error is other than to contact them as it is a permanent failure.  Our previous compact oven (purchased for around $30) lasted four years before we decided to replace it though it was still functioning.  I expected more from Breville based on reputation and the price.  I'm hesitant to use their products in the future, based on this experience.\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster oven. It's the best I've every had.  Toast is done to perfection.  It's quiet and east to keep clean.  It is also attractive.\n \n  I purchased a this toaster oven as a Christmas gift for my wife. We have owned several toaster ovens over the last  30 (or more) \n  This is a handy Mini oven that does its job really well.  We have had it for 2 weeks and are really pleased with the quality toasting and baking in it.\n \n  I bought this item five months ago and since last week it takes double the time to make the toasts. It is really a shame, if this product was of quality it would be really convenient since it is easy to use and well thought. But it quits working properly only after five months. I have written their customer support but I can imagine that they overwhelmed with such quality in their products.\n \n  Easy to use. \n  This is the one toaster oven that is classy looking, really works, and is of high quality.  Would highly recommend\n \n  I don't know how our family lived so many years without this oven.  It is perfect - we use it all of the time.  It works extremely well.  Expensive but worth every penny and it looks good too!\n ", "\n  My second oven but same product, with a large family we used it more then any testing company could. I bought others and returned it which I don't do that much and bought this one again because it works so well. Seller shipped on time and packaged as expected at best price.\n \n  This is a great toaster oven.  Preheats quickly and bakes, toasts, and reheats evenly.  My last oven didn't have a way to set the temp so this is leaps and bounds over the previous one.  It does get hot on top so make sure there's plenty of space around it for the heat to disperse.\n \n  Hello \n  We returned two of these ovens because basically, the temperature control is terrible. When it said it was 325\u00ba, two accurate oven thermometers showed the temperature was actually 200 to 250\u00ba. Yet it beeped to say it was ready and the heating elements cycled off. I could understand being off by 25\u00ba, but this is ridiculous. As you might expect, it made lousy pizza. The toasting was very good, but I don't need a $175 toaster! We will keep looking to find a better toaster oven.\n \n  Toasts bread and bagels faster\n \n  I really like the function and appearance.  The pans it comes with are high quality and its easy to keep clean\n \n  timer does not work well\n \n  Extremely efficient and awesome cooking properties.  Just love this oven. One of the best purchases I've made in a while. Thanks\n \n  easy to use and can do everything. easy to clean. a decent size\n \n  Like the oven very much, easy to use and clean.\n ", "\n  Few complaints except with the toast.  Figure on 7+ minutes for an english muffin!  Alas, when toasting, it cycles on and off!!!  What the?  Toasters should fire up and glow, period.  Bring back my old Sunbeam.  Also note:  when the power goes out you must reset your oven. \n  high quality product. Works well\n \n  Love it  Just the right size for the two of us.\n \n  Looks great and works great.  Only issue is its size compared to simplier models.  Comes with all the basic accessories.\n \n  If you live in a townhome or an apartment you might want to reconsider this product. It takes up way too much counter space. I had to take it to my oversized summer home. It has pre settings which are almost impossible to override. I wish I had my Black and Decker back.....the one you could hang under a counter that doesn'tseem to be made anymore. The hanger gismo not the oven.\n \n  Just love it!!\n \n  I would recommend this oven to everyone. Lets face it it's not perfect but neither are we. There are always critics.\n \n  I love it -- The oven is so easy to use with great results.  Very pleased with its delivery & good instructions & recipes.\n \n  We use it every day!  Love it!.\n \n  A solid item...easy to use...correct (no guessing) controls and of course pretty lights & soundz! A great one...worth the bucks!!\n ", "\n  I love this Breville BOV650XL Compact Smart Oven.  It works so nicely and cleans up beautifully.  It is made sturdy and is made to \n  Excellent.....does exactly what is says \"on the tin\"!  I would recommend this product to anybody who wants flexibility in the kitchen.\n \n  it work pretty good. no problem so far\n \n  Second purchase of this oven, cannot live without it convenience\n \n  Unfortunately I need to return it because this oven is not working. The START button works and light indicator is on but the temperature is not going up and no hit comes to the oven. There was no issue with packaging or accessories (trays, backing pans), everything was in the original wrap and I was very happy when got this delivery but need to return because it's not functioning at all. I always love and trust Breville products and it was the first time when I got it broken.\n \n  Excellent - easy to use, heats fast, light easy to clean - very well presented easy to be moved and removed from one place to the next.\n \n  Great item, you must read instructions thoroughly and experiment with settings and options to get best results, no complaints so far.\n \n  It cooks evenly, temps are calibrated well and I'm happy with it.\n \n  aewsome product \n  This toaster oven is better than I thought it would be. Easy to work. Toast comes out especially good, never worry about burning. Recommend this product.\n ", "\n  This is a great looking toaster, but it's cheapy and loose mounted buttons are a bad match for the highend design class.\n \n  Oven is to slow heating up and does not toast very well. No comparison to older one I had.\n \n  I love this toaster oven! My single slice of toast comes out perfect every time. The controls are simple, clear and easy to use.  I love the flat top that can be used as a plate warmer. Nicest toaster convection oven I've ever owned.  Definitely worth the money.\n \n  The purchase was as a gift, but I already owned one and really like it alot. Lots of great pre-programmed but revisable settings depending on the needs and applications of the cook.\n \n  best toaster oven I've ever had.\n \n  Cooks faster and easy to use\n \n  Forget your regular stove, toaster. Quick, easy to clean. Great for single person that is not into fancy cooking but I am sure it can do that too, if the cook has the talent.\n \n  We love it! It is a great addition to our kitchen.\n \n  Great toaster oven. My only complaint, the handle sticks out too much. Not a good thing in a small NY kitchen.\n \n  Hardly use the oven anymore. Great control over the cooking process and just handy when you don't want your food to be as good as it was yesterday.\n ", "\n  I have only used it for toasting, but so far, so good.  Perfect every time.  It looks nice too. It is expensive.\n \n  Makes the best toast!  Easy to use and clean.  Love my new toaster oven. Happy that I bought this item.\n \n  Except for the handle which is too big, it's a great oven.\n \n  What an amazing product so far!\n \n  We love this toaster oven.  Use it daily.\n \n  I love this toaster oven. Easy to clean slide out drawer and heats up super fast. Very visually appealing. We love it.\n \n  Very disappointed. I ordered this product and when I received it- every time I tried to use it, the machine would spark and it would blow a fuse in my kitchen. I am returning it and finding a different brand.\n \n  What a fantastic toaster oven!\n \n  The Breville Oven is amazing.  I can almost eliminate my large oven for this smart oven.  It will bake a pie, banana bread, re-heat my pizza and toast my bread perfectly! And, the amount of time to bake is less than it would have been in my oven.  Very economical, the only change I would make for this product is add a light inside the toaster and that's not critical.  Would recommend this product to anyone without reservation.\n \n  Very nice oven.  Going from the Cuisinart we had to this one is like going from a Yugo to a Cadillac.\n ", "\n  I really love this compact oven. It fits perfect on my counter and it works just as it says it will. Very easy to use.\n \n  Best thing since sliced bread.\n \n  Excellent piece of equipment.  Have always bought the $39.00 toaster oven specials, but this time, after my latest throw away broke down within the year decided to take it up a few notches..... Have only owned it a few months now, but time should tell how good my investment is...So far, I'm impressed with it's ability for toasting, oven, pizza reheats,  Excellent purchase so far.\n \n  This is well worth every penny it costs. No more low priced toaster ovens for me! This one is great!\n \n  This model allows the shelf to be pulled completely out. There is no \"notch\" as is typical in an oven to prevent such accidents. Further, when the shelf is partially pulled out, if it is too near its maximum extension, the weight of a casserole dish can cause it to tip and slide completely out, with everything landing disastrously on the floor. I have had painful burns as a result of this and several subsequent accidents. I was aware that the model no longer was made to automatically pull the shelf out when the door opened, and while that was disappointing, the pros seemed to out weigh this con. Not so! The high ratings this appliance has is based on earlier models that were better designed.\n \n  Really like this oven.\n \n  A great oven although the price is a little steep. So far, no complains\n \n  QUALITY PRODUCT. OVEN IS WHAT BREVILLE DESCRIBE AS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. I HAVE BEEN COOKING CORNBREAD AND BISCUITS IN IT.\n \n  I was searching for a toaster oven for a while, but I didn't see anything I like at Target, so I searched online and found Breville's oven on Amazon. I was gonna buy the bigger one (BOV850), but after looking at the measurements, I thought the smaller one (BOV650) would fit better for my kitchen. As soon as I took out the oven from the packaging, it's a little smaller than I had imagined. I should have bought the bigger one. That's my only regret... But if you have a small kitchen, this should be a perfect-sized oven for you. \n  I've owned many toaster ovens and this is by far the the best of all of them.\n ", "\n  At first I liked how little it was and the electronics but it takes FOREVER TO COOK !!! I had a cheaper Kenmore that worked for seven years and cooked quick. I'm planning on returning this expensive piece of poop and purchasing the most reliable and cost effective kenmore... If anyone is looking to buy a toaster oven that functional as broiler/baking over/ toaster and is looking to stay in budget... Please don't buy this... Go for the Kenmore products... They r WAY MORE COST EFFECTIVE W BETTER RESULTS.\n \n  Have enjoyed the oven better than any we have had.\n \n  The quality of this product is poor, ours died after ~13 months of light use, just after the warranty had expired.  When it was working it work ok but not really much better than the cheaper units available on the market, my advice is to stay away.\n \n  It's receiving 1 star because the oven didn't even work out of the box. I tried several different functions as well as different outlets around my home. The heating elements didn't even change color. Ordered a replacement from Amazon. We shall see if the replacement is operational.\n \n  With the several inexpensive toaster ovens I've owned in the past, I found that none of them cooked or baked evenly.  I took a chance and decided to spend a few extra bucks and get this Breville and boy am I happy I did.  I have baked/cooked and am thoroughly happy with the results.  I wish I had this Breville a long time ago!\n \n  This was a complete disaster. I had hoped that all the poor reviews were mistakes. Well they weren't. This was a huge mistake to buy. It did not work right away. The code that came up was so dangerous that the manual said to unplug the unit and call customer service at once. A horrible horrible oven. I'll listen to reviews next time.\n \n  very nice\n \n  One of the primary functions for this toaster oven should be toasting. It is the function it does least well with. One side of the bread (the top) gets done properly, while the bottom is almost not done at all. I would not recommend anyone spending the amount of money this costs for a unit that (mal)functions this way. \n  We have had several toaster ovens over our 42 years of marriage.  This is without a doubt \"THE BEST\".  It does what it is supposed to do---and does it very well!\n \n  a good fit in our kitchen\n ", "\n  best toaster oven ever!!\n \n  We love this oven! My husband raves about the perfect way it toasts. And baking is easy -- cookies, 2 pieces of chicken, re-heating etc. Love it.\n \n  Good quality.\n \n  Wanted a toaster oven that would last.  I use it everyday and this one seemed perfect.  Every time I used it, I would smile because it worked so well.  B & D always gave me one sided toast (so annoying). Shortly after one year, it stopped working.  I didn't even try to return it as it was a little over a year and I didn't want to deal with the hassle.  My husband ran out and bought a replacement (B & D of course) even though I asked him NOT to buy B & D.  I want to buy another one, but I feel like a chump (just throwing money away).\n \n  no review\n \n  I wish door had a catch for the rack on it. Since it does not you have to be carefull when pulling tray out. Also does not seal the tightest. For the price I thought it would fit much tighter. Good oven but some nice features but pricey.\n \n  Got the toaster oven as a gift after checking its rating with Consumer Reports.  My son and daughter-in-law love it.  I now see this brand in many of my friends homes and am considering getting one for myself.\n \n  I purchased from Manufacturer Outlet through Amazon.  Didn't use the toaster oven right away, but when we did we noticed the tray would fall out onto the door when we were trying to remove the baking pan.  Contacted Manufacturer Outlet and they refused to allow a return,  Amazon's A-Z Guarantee wasn't available because the unit wasn't damaged.  This oven is dangerous - I won't use it for fear of the tray falling and dumping the contents of the baking pan.  Don't buy this oven - dangerous.  And especially don't deal with Manufacturer Outlet.\n \n  really easy to use, very high quality.  The dial controls are great, and the settings for pizza, bagels, etc. are really simple to use.  And it looks great.\n \n  I do not write reviews, so listen up.  There is not a single thing I would change on this oven.\n ", "\n  IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY RELATIVES AND I EVEN MEANT TO GET THE LARGER OVEN BUT MADE THE MISTAKE WHEN CLICKING, BUT THIS WORKS JUST FINE!! LOVE MY TOAST AND BAGGLES BROWNING SO EVENLY NOW.\n \n  It does a great job, we are very pleased\n \n  Took some time to understand controls, but once we had that down, we think that it is great. Use it all the time.\n \n  I really wanted to like this toaster oven - the controls and size were perfect. But, it died the first day after finishing its start up routine. Thankfully I bought it through Amazon, so the return was a breeze.\n \n  It toasts well and does everything else well too. It is larger than our previous toaster ovens.We're very happy with it.\n \n  best toaster oven i've ever bought and i've gone thru many of them.  My elderly father fell in love with it and i had to buy him one!\n \n  So far it seems to be an excellent toaster oven, well made and efficient. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an updated all around appliance.\n \n  lasted less than 3 years. don't think it's worth the price. It was good while it lasted, but I won't buy again.\n \n  Doesn't sit level and has no leveling options on feet.\n \n  We love it.  We've used it for all kinds of things but this is the first toaster oven we've used for toast and the settings make each individual's preferences so easy.\n "]}, "/Oster-2-Slice-Toaster-Metallic-TSSTTRJBG1/product-review/B00F5NUOH6/ref=sxin_7?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B00F5NUOH6&cv_ct_cx=oven&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source&dchild=1&keywords=oven&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B00F5NUOH6&pd_rd_r=9ced2fa1-ad75-48bd-8f84-ae3315c634b5&pd_rd_w=cDgMy&pd_rd_wg=Ca86i&pf_rd_p=9e4ba918-f6ad-4007-841c-6563d381515f&pf_rd_r=TPFMSWA0170V0ZZA0PTQ&qid=1597683407&sr=1-2-72d6bf18-a4db-4490-a794-9cd9552ac58d&tag=mashcontent-20": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["2 slice toaster features extra wide slots to accommodate a variety of items", "Auto adjusting bread guides for even, consistent toasting", "7 toast shades from light to dark and 3 settings: bagel, frozen, and pastry", "Removable crumb tray makes cleanup easy"], "Product Description": "Start your day with a perfectly crisp slice of toast using the Oster 2 Slice Toaster.

It offers a timeless look that coordinates with nearly any kitchen decor.\n\n"}, "Reviews": ["\n  You know, it's a toaster. It toasts bread. It toasts pop-tarts. It toasts bagels. It toasts english muffins. It toasts all these things, and it does it how any reasonable person would expect it to. \n  With every toaster I've ever owned with a bagel setting, the toaster would heat the inside of the bagel, but not the outside.  With this Oster, the Bagel setting heats both elements -- burning the outside of the bagel before the inside gets toasted. \n  The Oster was recommended by a website we consult for thorough product testing. It was the cheapest toaster they tested and outperformed toasters 4 times the price. We tend to dislike buying cheap, disposable appliance (or anything cheap and disposable, for that matter), we are \"buy it for life\" type people. When we were shopping to replace our 30 year old toaster, we were disappointed by what we perceived as almost universally low quality products for sometimes-inordinate prices. Some of them were hideous while others were simply okay.  We took a chance on it and we couldn't be happier. This toaster is fantastic, and not just \"fantastic for the price\". It toasts quickly and evenly. Button-feel is good (as far as toasters go, anyway) and the knob feel is reasonable. The appearance is handsome, and I appreciate the classic layout and modest footprint (I would have liked perfectly straight sides, but hey, you aren't supposed to nestle your toaster right against the wall anyhow so no major loss of space there). None None None \n  \u00a0Very uneven toasting when using only one of the slots.  In toast mode (NOT bagel mode) the inside of the toast gets way darker than it should for the setting selected, whereas the outside remains many shades lighter.  Maybe it is because the inside gets the heat from both its own slot plus some of the heat from the empty slot.  If you always use both slots, then I guess this toaster will do but it's definitely not for me because most of the time I only toast one slice of bread at a time, so this toaster burns the inside while the outside is very light.  I am returnig it. My previous toaster was cheaper and did a much better job at even toasting when using only one slot.\n \n  This toaster has 9 heating element rows on 4 sides, each side is broken into 4 columns. Three of the columns the elements are about an inch, one column is about 3/4\". \n  I eat toast daily because I don't feel like cooking or eating much else when I roll out of bed at 4:30 AM.  I prefer my bread lightly toasted on each side.  This toaster only does half of that job.  One side is lightly toasted and the other side is untoasted.  If I crank up the setting, sometimes nothing changes.  At other times I get bread that is lightly toasted on one side and burnt on the other.  I have read reviews of this product stating that it will toast evenly, which is why I purchased it.  Unfortunately, my toaster won't toast:(  However, it does look nice and it does have several attractive buttons and knobs.\n \n  I am still using this toaster a year later and it's pretty and doesn't take up a lot of room. Let me say that I am an \"occasional user\" of a toaster so if t here's a  hiccup, I can work with it as it's not an every-day thing.  This toaster does have a hiccup that if you were an everyday user, you'd find it annoying and may send it back.  It does \"okay,\" but often, I have to turn an English muffin or bagel backwards and then push back down to get the other side as dark as the first side.  For the money and if you don't toast often, this is a good buy. No one wants to stand over the toaster and manage its functionality. the color purple by the way is exactly what's shown in the photo and gets a lot of complements.\n \n  I've had this toaster for 6 months. I spent weeks reading toaster reviews before I settled on this one. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on just a toaster, something used a few times a week. The reviews on this were great and $30 is reasonable. Every time I use this toaster, I curse it and then I curse the reviews. At no time had it ever toasted evenly. I have to toast twice so as to flip the bread half way through. It burns randomly regardless of the heat setting. The toast option buttons are fading and one is completely gone. The top part of the bread doesn't get toasted, since it doesn't go down far enough. The only positive is the color is vibrant metallic.  I wish I would have saved the dough and added a dime for each piece of burnt toast, so I could get a pricier one.\n \n  My toaster arrived without one of the four non-skid rubber feet. It rocks but not in a positive way. I contacted Oster and was told that the part was not available. Are we kidding, here? I'd send another toaster before risking a review like this! Forget Oster, folks. They are not interested in making customers happy. I went to a hardware store and bought 4 stick-on rubber pads for my toaster. I would not expect Oster to reimburse. Just another company that sells and forgets.\n \n  The toaster is very nice looking and appears well built; however, the sides get extremely hot during toasting and the top is extremely hot when toasting.  It has been nearly 25 minutes and the toaster is still too hot to repack to return.  The darkness setting toasts the same whether set at 4 or 1.  Returning ASAP way to dangerous to use.\n ", "\n  This toaster gets many positive reviews based on the great color of purple.  I like that myself as well.  Frustratingly I did see a minor scrape in the paint right near one of the bread slots but I let it slide.  But most important is how this toaster works a fact many seem to ignore.  I honestly am getting fed up with products that should be simple and reliable just not doing their job. We are talking about a toaster here and a mid-range priced one at that.  Why can't the toaster be expected to simply make toast evenly toasted?  I have attached 2 pictures of a piece of whole wheat toast toasted on the 4 setting.  It was a fresh piece of bread and look at how much darker one side is than the other.  It happens with everything I use this machine for whatever the setting and whether toasting one or two pieces of bread.  I had an old toaster that was so old it was rusty and I stupidly threw it away when I bought this.  Yes with that one I had to work to get the bread to stay inserted but once it was it toasted evenly.  I have done my research here and it seems every toaster has people saying it does not toast evenly with pictures to prove it.  So I guess I will have to settle and keep this one but I honestly can't recommend it for it just does not do the job.  But if you like purple go for it.\n \n  We got an Oster toaster for our wedding (15 years ago) and it just died (our 6 year old put legos in it and melted them).  I bought this hoping it would be an upgrade on what was a great product.  I was SO INCREDIBLY disappointed!!  It has some cool bells and whistles, but it can't even toast a piece of toast evenly on both sides on the \"Toast\" setting, or any other setting for that matter.  We tried them all, and in both slots, one side would burn while the other was under cooked.  See my pictures for details.  I am appalled at how bad this toaster is and my standards are very low!  We just want even toast!  That's all!  I sent it back.  I have loved the Oster brand but will think twice after my experience with this toaster.\n \n  I had purchased a toaster about 4 years ago from Amazon and it worked very well, for a long time. However for the last 6 months or so it was dying. It wouldn't toast very long, and then one day the spring broke to activate the coils. \n  Sadly, this thing is defective, and I have once again learned the basic rule of Amazon: if an item looks like a great deal, assume it is irregular in some way. This time the product (supplied by Amazon) appeared to have been opened by someone before me . . . . . who evidently spotted the same defect and returned it. And then it was sent to me. Thanks, Amazon. \n  I live in Canada and ordered this through Amazon.com as it was a much better price (even with the exchange) than I could get at Amazon.ca. I had an address (my daughter's) so I could have it sent to her. \n  If six weeks is enough to judge a toaster, then I'd say this is the best little toaster I've ever had. Whether toast will be as nice a year or two from now, I don't know. It does a reasonably nice of toasting both sides of a slice of bread. The two sides are never identical but that's a lot better than having one side toasted and the other side not toasted at all. I've seen lots of complaints about one-sided toasting, including on this little Oster, but the one I got definitely toasts both sides, even if not equally. The temperature of the bread is important, of course. The footprint is remarkably compact. I like the retro look a lot and the dark gray is very nice. The controls all work and are easy to get used to.\n \n  Another toaster that has crumbs falling somewhere in the toaster instead of the crumb tray, and the bread no longer toasts, it just drys out. I tried to toast for one more time this morning using the bagel button (that sometimes works) but not this morning. Instead the toaster burned crumbs somewhere in the toaster which made the smoke alarm go off. In the last 2 years I have bought 4 different toasters, none of them lasted more then 6 months. How hard is it to find a toaster that is capable of toasting 2 slices of toast a day?\n \n  Overall, I like this toaster and will use it for as long as it lasts (hopefully many many years). However, I would like to mention two drawbacks in case they are relevant to anyone. First, the toaster is not very deep and my large bagels stick out slightly and to not toast evenly. It's not a deal breaker but I've never seen a toaster this shallow before. The other thing is that when you lift the handle to lift the toast high enough to extract it, it does not raise it very much. Again, not a deal breaker and it is adequate if one is careful. \n  I love the finish on this. It looks smart and it's easy to clean. I like the ease of control- and it's so much better than my last brand. The only thing I don't love is how really short the cord is. I have a very limited counter space, and limited outlets. I had to rearrange to have this work and not have to have it backwards!! Really. It's never happened before, and I thought it was caught under the toaster at first. It's just shorter than any cord I've seen on a countertop electric- and wish there was an extra 12\"!! ( Probably not a problem in a modern home with a zillion outlets...) I still do like it alot, and price was very reasonable for the quality.\n \n  After depressing the toaster lever, the bread was still sticking out the top (see attached picture).  I look inside - it appears that the bread holder thingy only goes down about 2/3 of the way.  I toasted an experimental piece of spelt bread on \"3\" (medium-low setting) to help me decide about returning for refund vs exchanging for one that works properly.  As expected the bread did not get toasted on the top, but to my surprise the bread was almost burned (see attached picture).  I returned the toaster in hopes of finding one that works more reliably.\n ", "\n  I've used this toaster for several months now and I love it. The dark gray color looks so nice and does not show any scratches or scrapes. It still looks brand new. The temperature settings are very consistent. I store it in a corner counter cubby - and I'll be honest, I have been known to pull the toaster out, put bread in it, push down the lever and then realize several minutes later that I forgot to plug it in. This toaster prevents that. The lever will not activate if it is not plugged in (dummy proof!  LOL)  There is a button to push if you want to stop the toasting immediately which is great as just pushing up the lever is hard on a toaster and will wear out the lever over time. This toaster also has a warming feature in the event you need to pop back in a piece of toast, bagel or English muffing to keep warm (it does not brown it further.) For the price, this is a great toaster.\n \n  So far so good. I compared quite a few toasters, searching for one that wasn't ridiculously expensive (just can't see spending extravagantly on toast), but one that would toast evenly and quickly. Other inexpensive toasters I've bought at local stores seem to last less than a year before the heating elements begin to fail and you have to keep flipping the toast around in hopes of getting some degree of color on both sides of the bread. While this particular toaster isn't heavy duty, and has a good many plastic parts, it is doing it's job. Will update in a few months. \n  This had great reviews and was 'recommended by Amazon based on reviews and price, so I bought one. \n  After using this toaster for some months, most of my \u201ccomplaints\u201d are gone!  After all, toast is just toast! It really works fine and is nicely controllable. \n  Not hugely happy with this. We'd had a nice Kitchen Aid for 20+ years which, finally, I couldn't repair. Read all the reviews religiously and got this. It feels tinny and, a real problem, toast gets to the side of the tines (?), drops down, and becomes really hard to get out. We make all our own bread so, when cut, is thinner than store bread. This wasn't ever a problem with previous toaster. Also, while you can lift the handle up to bring the toast above the line of the top to get it out, there's not much play there so not really effective. Had it for 2 months now and guess we're stuck with it but not happily so.\n \n  Love the color, and while it worked it worked well enough. But here it is, just after the return date, and it has broken already. I got to use it about 12 times before the mechanism that keeps bread/bagel down in the slot stopped working, and the lights that indicate what's being toasted don't work anymore either. I don't manhandle my appliances, so it just broke for no good reason. Unfortunately, I just missed the return and refund date, so off to landfill it goes, which makes me even more unhappy.\n \n  The first thing I noticed when I removed the toaster from the box was that the button to adjust the darkness was very loose. The first time I used the toaster I noticed that the bread was toasted very unevenly. One side was hardly toasted the other was burnt. After closer inspection I notice that some of the heating elements do not work.  This toaster doesn't work has well as the one I replaced it with. I bought this model because Amazon stated that it worked just as well as the more expensive models.  It does not!!!!\n \n  I bought this toaster in feb of 2019 so I've had it for more than a year. It is a good toaster except for the following: It does not toast all of the bread, even bagels. It does a good job, but not a great job, there are several areas where the item being toasted do not get toasted. I am finally going to donate this toaster and purchase another one.\n \n  Works very well. The slots for bread are nice and hold the bread slices I buy with no issues. However, some brand of bagels are a tight fit. The toasting levels are well segregated and deliver different amount of toasting consistently. There is a lever on the front to switch the toaster on once you have placed the bread inside. It always pops up the slices once done. There is no 'ring' or 'ding' once it is done. The power cable is not very long, about 1.5 feet probably. If you have power outlets on the counters then it should not be any problem at all. However, if your outlets are at a distance from the counters, then you would needs an extension cable. \n  I use this for Toast and Bagels. My toaster experience is the $250 Brevelle Convection Oven, which I had to part with recently. It sets the bar high. ", "\n  This is not the best or the worst toaster. It's good, it toasts, it's small, it's easy to store, it's not expensive, it comes in a lot of colors. This is our 2nd one of this exact same model. We had a red one that lasted years, but it finally got to the point where it was really only toasting one side. When I went to look for a new one there were fancier, crazier models but I just want to toast a slice of sourdough or my kids' eggos now and then. I don't need anything high tech, that toasts 4 slices at once or makes eggs. I just want it to toast some stuff, and this does the job. In fact, in our house we like our stuff barely toasted, so we probably aren't even using it to its full potential as-is. My kids won't eat the eggos if they have \"burnt\" on the edges, and I like my toast just crispy but not too browned. If you need 4 slices, or something that will fit really large bagels, or make you bacon, get a fancier one. If you just want something simple that works and will last, this is great.\n \n  I bought this toaster because the one I had (a high end model that just stopped working) would no longer pop the toast up.  If you go by name brands,  the one I owned before this one should have lasted for years, but didn't.  So knowing Oster is an old name in appliances, I decided to give this a try.  I'm glad I did.  It has all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a much more expensive model and is easy to clean.  I think it does a great job with all sizes and shapes of breads/bagels/muffins, and couldn't ask for more...\n \n  Great toaster, excellent price point. I\u2019m sure there are some that have other fancy features, but I only need to toast typical items, adjust the item I toast, adjust the darkness of the toast. I don\u2019t need it to wash my car or blow dry my hair. I don\u2019t need more than two slots for the toast. This was the perfect toaster for the price. It looks nice on my updated marble countertops too. Easy to store. Functionality: \n  This claims to have a very consistent toast but it's far from it.  Generally whatever touches the bottom will be noticeably darker/burnt that what's near the top.  It doesn't bring bread down var enough for it to toast the upper part so you have most of it toasted but a sizeable portion untoasted. \n  Toaster is priced right and looks cool but. Toasted several breads and all cane out one side one side not toasted or uneven toasting. Don\u2019t waste your money just because it looks cool. Sent back and got a cuisineart. New toaster is great.\n \n  Just in 2 years of use, bottom piece inside the toaster is bent and came loose. Manged to bend back and made it usable but every time thick bread or half the bagel goes in it gets stack and while getting it out, bottom metal gets twisted or bent. Not happy and looking for a replacement.\n \n  Overall happy with the purchase.  Toasts evenly on all 4 sides if there are 2 slices or both sides if one slice.  The toast knob works pretty representative of where it is dialed.  For example at 2pm it gives medium toasting. The slots are fairly wide to accommodate bagels but they way the slots are designed thinner bread is held securely.  Seems well made for the price and looks good.  I deducted a star because larger bread sticks a little out of the top.  It could have been about 1/2 inch taller.  Not really a problem as most items fit and I can turn down the control and flip the toast midway.  Would recommend\n \n  Love the color, but not the best toaster in the world.  The slots are narrow and don't go down very far, so some brands of sandwich bread stick up and don't get toasted at the top.  Also, my old toaster has a bagel setting where only the inner part of the bagel would get toasted and the outside would not.  This toaster has a bagel setting, but it just slightly lowers the temperature, but still toasts all sides of the bagel, so I find bagels get burned on the outside and not fully toasted on the inside.  Would not recommend if you use the toaster a lot, however I do love the pop of color on my counter.\n \n  I purchased this as a replacement for an bbn older Oster I had. Although almost identical in looks, you can feel it is definitely made more cheaply. I expected this but what I didn't expect was how hot the exterior of the toaster gets. The bottom is reasonable,  but even with my calloused hands, I could feel strong heat from the sides. I would not feel safe with kids in the kitchen at breakfast time so I am returning.\n \n  I love my new toaster, this is a one person household, so I only toast one slice at a time. It toasted both sides evenly and popped up high enough for me to get it, without getting a burn. It is black and looks really nice next to my black coffee maker. The crumb tray removes easily and wipes off clean, I only wish the tray had been in the front of the toaster, instead of in back. Not a big deal, but the only thing I would change..\n ", "\n  I use this toaster to make toast. I was so happy I bought this toaster. I hadn't owned a toaster for at least 15 years because I have had little self-control over eating toast.I love it. It was time to buy one again I thought. I researched brands etc. and decided on this one. It does make toast very well. To me though, it seemed to take longer to toast than I expected. I end up canceling the toast time after a while and take it as it is. It always tastes good regardless. I chose a matte type finish toaster. It does not show finger prints therefore clean up isn't much of a issue. I probably hadn't been as excited about getting a delivery as I was waiting for this to arrive. I am glad I made this purchsse.\n \n  It's a toaster, it toasts. I can't believe I've been reduced to reviewing a toaster on Amazon....LOL. But seriously, it's a decent looking toaster. One main reason we bought it iss because it somewhat matches our Samsung \"Black Stainless\" (Gunmetal) appliances. It's not perfect, but it's abouth the only dark gray \"metallicy\" toaster we could find. The defrost then toast feature actually worked surprisingly well, not a gimmick. I don't judge a toaster by \"eveness\", so don't even ask. As long as a piece of toast comes out with some sort of tan color on each side, I'm happy. I don't care if it's even across the whole side or from side to side...it's toast.\n \n  As headline states, the mechanism that \"holds\" the toast down is unreliable. Pops up too soon or not soon enough. Can't seem to find a setting that toasts without burning. Must keep pressure on front tab until toast toasted.\n \n  The toaster arrived with crumbs in the crumb pan so was obviously a former return.  It toasted very unevenly - good on one side, barely toasted on the other side.  Which is exactly why I wanted to replace my present toaster!  Now I have to pack it up and lug it to the UPS store.  I ordered a replacement so I will be anxious to see if it toasts well, since it got a good review on SweetHome.\n \n  This is a good quality toaster without having to pay exorbitant price tag.  I do still find it does not quite toast even.y on both sides at the same time, so I do still have the flip the items being toasted.  Just about every toaster I have ever had has this same issue.  Maybe a pricier toaster is better in this area, IDK, but it is not worth spending an add I amount of money.  It is a nice color, smaller footprint so fits well on the counter without being an albatross.\n \n  We had an older model of this toaster and loved it but the heating element was dying after 8 years of use and it was more economical to buy a new one than to try to replace the element.  We tried several different toasters off the big box store shelves but they either got too hot for our children to be using, or took absolutely forever to heat a freezer waffle.  I ordered this from Amazon, plugged it in and put in a pair of waffles.  They came out quickly and the toaster itself wasn't much more than warm to the touch.  However, this toaster has a high pitched squeal when in use.  I debated returning this because of the squeal but decided the squeal was more tolerable than the super hot ones or super slow ones that I found in local stores and we needed a toaster.  Overall it does what it needs to and is safe for little fingers but the squeal is annoying.\n \n  I HAVE A QUIESENART BREAD MAKER AND THE SLICES ARE LARGE AND IT MAKES A HEAVY BREAD. THIS TOASTER WILL NOT TAKE THE WHOLE PIECE OF BREAD AND DOESN'T TOAST THE TOP PART. ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS TOASTING WELL BUT THE INSIDE OF THE PIECE OF TOAST IS STILL VERY BREAD LIKE. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD MAKE A TOASTER FOR BREAD MAKER BREAD. I COULD NOT FIND ONE. \n  At first I really liked the toaster with so many features and it does a great job toasting. However I accidentally turned the knob to far over and the bread started to burn.  With most toasters it is really easy to just pull the lever up and pop the toast out.  Not with this one.  It wouldn't budge.  I had to unplug the toaster and dump the bread out.  I bought this because my toaster is in storage in another state and I wont have it for a few months.  This will get dumped once I get a normal toaster back\n \n  I have had this toaster for over a year and cuss every time I use it.  Primary use is to toast bagels and they didnt even mark which way to insert bagel half for toasting.  In actuality it doesnt seem to matter as both sides of the slots heats identically on any button selected.  Unable also to thoroughly clean it.\n \n  It is amazing to search for a product available in a price rang from a few dollars to $100! So many choices! Having gone through a few toasters, I have to say this is among the very best. It does a great job doing what a toaster is supposed to do-produce a well toasted bread product. This toaster does just that ! It will do other things, but for me, my wish is for a nicely browned slice of bread . For safety, the sides a cool to the touch, no risk of an accidental burn.\n ", "\n  This toaster did an \"ok\" job for about 14 months and then quit. My previous toaster lasted for about 8 years. A call to a repair place said that a) it looked like the circuit board was bad and b) any cost would be more than its worth. \n  I like everything about this toaster except the temp control.  Even though it goes from 1 to 7 for adjustment just below 2.5 is warm but not toasted and 2.5 is very toasted.  I would prefer to have the entire range to adjust instead of having to move the knob ever so slightly to make a big difference.\n \n  This is a terrible toaster.  With in a few weeks all of the lettering on the buttons melted off.  The metal that holds the toast in place is so bent and mangled inside that the toast will barely come out.  It doesnt fit a bagel unless you flatten it. \n  We had an old white Oster toaster (it guess there are lots of poets jokes on the rhyme) for years and it finally started toasting just on one side. After reading lots of reviews, it seemed like Oster's were a good value in this price range. A Walmart-only one for about the same price got similar reviews on the Walmart site and was a little more conventional looking, but the nearest store where it might have been in stock was five miles away and I've been bit by Walmart in-stock errors before so Amazon got the business. Had it in two days without any effort. While there were comments  at our house about the color, none about having a working toaster again. It works pretty much as well as our old one did, which is not perfect but reliably. About the only complaint is that the toast is not perfectly uniformly toasted some of the time, depending on what's being toasted, but it's always pretty good.\n \n  This seems to be a great toaster.  My wife thought it toasted kind of slow but I pointed out that, with our old toaster, you either got toast that was scorched or too light.  On thinking about it, it occurred to me that the thing tried to do things so quickly that tha margin between good and bad was about zilch minus (sort of like the dosage levels with Heroin where a slight overdose would kill you dead). \n  The good: My kids loved the look of this toaster. It's a deep, shiny, metallic purple that makes quite a statement. \n  When I put bread in after a while toast comes out. Like real toast and sometimes it's burnt but that has to do with the knob which I ALWAYS put all the way up just to see if maybe this once it will stop working and bam! I got them right there! Broken toaster. But no. No. It always works okay. And it's purple like a jelly bean or a kindergartener holding their breath.\n \n  Read many reviews of many toasters. Prior to deciding on a purchase, I read articles on \"review\" sites, with questionable pedigrees but not  Consumer Reports - why pay.  This toaster came up for some positive comments, and negative ones, but for the price point I said what the heck. \n  This toaster looks about as cheap in person as it does online. Fortunately, its an inexpensive way to make toast and the toaster works flawlessly. \n  This toaster is so pretty and works perfectly.  We had a white Oster toaster for 4 years, but with the kitchen remodel, it no longer looked appropriate in my opinion and I really wanted a new stylish one and this one fit the bill. No complaints.\n ", "\n  Just received this so far so good. Cooking a few throw away breads as it does smell. Will come back for update. \n  Only time will tel regarding the quality of a toaster.  So far it's OK although it does seem to take longer to toast toast that the past toasters I've had.  Fortunately it does seem to keep toasting and does toast evenly.  Again, only time will tell.  Good luck in your search for a good, long lasting toaster.  So far I am happy with this one.  The last one, the brand started with an N, broke shortly after obtaining it.\n \n  This thing is great! It's very consistent and makes near perfect toast. I originally purchased one of these for my in-laws and they really liked it. So when I got fed up with fighting my old toaster I purchased another one of these and I'm very glad that I did! I hope they keep making this model for at least the rest of my life, because I found a good one and I want to stick with it!\n \n  We were excited about this product because it got high reviews and the cost was very reasonable.  we must have gotten a lemon.  Very first piece of toast I put in there was burnt as black as it could  be. I dialed the setting down half way and put another piece in. This was thick whole wheat bread. It seemed like it was taking a really long time to toast and it was. Burnt again!  Put it on one for the next try. Had to push cancel to save my toast so i could have some with my breakfast.  Later on my son ruined a perfectly good bagel, burnt too far to eat set on lowest setting. he too had to push cancel to get a decent toasted bagel.  So I wrapped it up and shipped it out.  Only good thing is Amazon great streamlined return policy. This toaster was useless!\n \n  I've had this toaster for about 2 years and it works great.  It doesn't seem too cheap and I haven't had any issues with it not working.  My only wish is that the slots were a little bigger for bagels since it is hard to fit them in there.  Otherwise, very happy with my purchase!\n \n  This toaster makes a faint high pitched electric sound when on, it is awful. Also gets pretty warm on the outside, but I notice that is standard with many. I just received it today, Oster offices closed when I called at 3pm PST (open til 6 EST), will likely return it. Bummer.\n \n  This is a very good toaster, especially considering the price. The construction is solid overall, the up/down mechanism has a positive, quality feel to it. The toasting is even on both sides in each of the 2 slots, with the temperature setting at 4 it provides a light/medium browning level that I find perfect. \n  You need to carefully research toasters since I found some of the cheaper off-brands are pushed by folks who may not have even bought them or used them. Oster is a reputable brand and I performed some research on a number of websites and this model consistently ranked high.  So I pulled the trigger, ordered, and have been using it for a month or so. I am very impressed at its construction (in this day and age of cheap builds), smooth operation, and how it works very consistently in toasting. I like the automatic guides that keep the bread firmly in place. So far so good.  The only complaint is that the dial to adjust darkness needs to have an easier to see mark that clearly shows the current setting. I added a small piece of white tape at the indicator mark.\n \n  I considered both cheaper and more expensive toasters, actually taking over a two weeks making my decision (who thinks that much about toasters!?). I decided on this Oster 2-slice toaster, and am incredibly happy with it. We've only had it a month or so, so I can't speak of its longevity just yet, but it looks sleek on our countertop, is cool to the touch, and most importantly, toasts our bread well. We enjoy the functions on this model. Get it!\n \n  Can't believe a Toaster labeled \"Amazon's Best\" would turn out to be something that should be labeled \"If you want your bread toasted on one side and not the other, this is your best buy!\"  Wish it were as easy to return it as it was to buy it.  Amazon products have been great for me but this rotten apply sure put a damper on things.  At this moment I'm waiting for shipments of other items.  Sure hope they turn out better.\n ", "\n  Well I thought I would love this!  The color is gorgeous!  HOWEVER..  The bagel setting still toasts both sides.  Not only that no matter how low the setting it burns them.  I had a toaster with the same features same brand name and loved it.  After11 years it died.  So I thought great.  Wrong, Wrong, Wrong!!  I threw the packing and box away so I do not know if I can still send it back.  I will certainly will try however!\n \n  I replaced my working toaster with this because it toasts a broader range of breads successfully. My old toaster required two cycles to successfully toast a slice of Kinnikinnick gluten-free bread. This will get it nice and golden with a setting of six, while 3 or 4 works fine for \"regular\" bread. It's controls are easy to read and operate, and it appears reliable and well-built.\n \n  This toaster toasted bread well and heated up frozen toaster strudels to my liking very well. The only issue we had with it so far is that since day one, it makes a high pitch noise when in use. We thought this sound would go away after using it for a while but every time we use it, that annoying high pitched frequency spreads throughout the rooms.\n \n  Love the color!  Picture does not do it justice.  Purple may not be for everyone, but this has an \"automotive\" vibe to the color. Hard to describe, but very pretty. \n  Does not fit a full slice of bread. The top sticks out and doesn\u2019t toast. Might be okay with an English muffin or something smaller. Full size bread, NO WAY! Kind of dumb to make a toaster that can\u2019t fit bread.\n \n  I replaced my previous toaster for this Oster Model. I love the features for Bagels and Frozen Items such as Eggo Waffles and Eggo's French toast.  They come out great and the toaster is quite stylish. Love the product.\n \n  Since September we've had to continue to turn the heat knob up & up. We're already at a \"5\" and it's only bee 3 1/2 months. I don't see this thing lasting for more than another 3 months. \n  Great Toaster especially for the price. I've never owned an Oster toaster before so I didn't know exactly what to expect even though the reviews were generally very good. I'm  very happy with this toaster. It browns the toast beautifully and consistently every time. My old Black & Decker never toasted properly right from the beginning so I am really thrilled with my Oster purchase.  This Oster is exactly what I hoped that it would be. It's only drawback is that it doesn't have a retractable cord but it's really no big deal.\n \n  The first time I ordered this toaster it made a high pitched buzzing noise when it was toasting so I got a replacement through Amazon. The replacement toaster lasted 6 months before an internal piece broke. One side slot does not push the toast up because a portion of the lever broke. Also it does not toast evenly on both sides despite what other reviews said. I have emailed Oster customer support and asked for a refund, I'm done trying with this toaster. Don't waste your money on it.\n \n  This toaster is defective and I must have gotten the \"Lemon\"! This toaster was rated #2, but it doesn't perform as such.  In either slot, the bread toasts dark on one side and much lighter on the other.  We've tried adjusting the settings from Light to Dark, but it only intensifies the toast with burning on the higher settings. I would not recommend this product.\n ", "\n  I expected some issues with this as any toaster, but....... What a shock, a product that actually does what it is designed to do, and it does it SO WELL.  Wish I had bought this years ago.  The ratings I read were right on target.  The product performs just as advertised.  You will be very happy with this well designed toaster.\n \n  I purchased this toaster 6 months ago, and it has never heated evenly, or toasted both sides of the bread, or toasted bagels properly, nothing!!  I may have gotten a defective model, or maybe this is just a a cheap, poorly-made toaster.  I wasn't willing to spend any additional money to send it back and find out which it is.  So today I had enough, and spent a little more to get a KitchenAid.  So far, it's working perfectly.\n \n  Oster TSSTTRJBG1-NP  Jelly Bean 2 slice toaster from Amazon. \n  Horrible toaster. The worst toaster I have ever owned (and I've owned some miserable toasters). \n  I decided to try this toaster based on a friends recommendation. The toaster has been tried for over a few months and still produces horrible results. It toasts uneven, doesn't cover the entire piece of toast, has a high pitch tune while toasting. \n  Toasts well, looks nice but my wife hears it emitting a high pitched tone when using.  Can't imagine what is causing the sound.  My hearing is not good enough to hear it so it is fine for me!  At least it is not on often or for long.\n \n  I like this toaster. It browns consistently and quickly every time.  The outside doesen't get hot.  It accommodates a range of thickness and height of bread, but the length could be greater. Considering the low price, I'm probably just nit picking.  I notice that the otherwise similar 4 slice model has slots twice as long rather than 4 separate slots.  Maybe worth considering.\n \n  This is my second purchase of this toaster.  The 1st one lasted approximately 7yrs, which is plenty of use time for me.  I use my toaster very frequently\n \n  I recently purchased a Black and Decker 4 slice toaster and it was junk, so I purchased this new one instead and it was wonderful.  It toasts like it should and fast and has a very nice appearance (Metallic grey) for the looks.  The price was great too.  I would recommend buying this 2 slice toaster instead of the 4 slice.  Seems to work much better.\n \n  The toaster is generally fine except that lever and basket thingies only pop half way up on their own.  I have to manually lift the lever all the way up so I can get the toast out.  The dial for how dark to make the toast is hard to read. ", "\n  Toasts evenly and consistently, at a very reasonable price. Was specifically looking for  toaster that to replace my 15 year old model that I finally tired of (due to its inability to maintain consistency). \n  Unlike some other toasters, the darkness adjustments on this one actually work!  It easily accepts Texas toast which is our favorite.  She likes the color and design and I like the functionality.  It doesn't slide around on the counter, either.  Toasters don't seem to last long these days so we'll just have to wait and see if this one measures up to its durability claims.  For now, though, we are very pleased with this product.\n \n  Awful...it only toasts ONE SIDE OF THE BREAD....I had a cheap toaster before this one and it worked better than this....I must have gotten a defective one because it's awful.  Doesn't even take a slice of bread all the way down to toast it, only the bottom half of the bread and only one side...don't waste your money\n \n  Product was left in the rain on the driveway in manufacture's box without outer carton or any additional protection. This delivery address has a marked delivery box at the entrance to property in addition to a sheltered overhang at the front entrance of the building. \n  I am very pleased with this toaster so far.  I make only toast, so I cannot evaluate the bagel and frozen settings, but it took only a few tries to establish my desired darkness settings for either one slice or two slices.  One slice or two, the toaster is consistent within its settings.  I would buy this brand and model again, though I have had it only a short time so I can\u2019t rate its durability.\n \n  I love this toaster. Looks so cute. Easy to clean. Like all inexpensive toasters the heating elements are not the best and one side comes out lighter than the other requiring a flip around once through the toasting process. I've had it more than a year and i noticed a little rust starting on the top. It cleaned up well with some elbow grease. Its worth the price. Good value for 30 bucks or so\n \n  It only toasts the right side of the bread and warms the left side. That is the main reason I bought a new one as my 5 year old toaster only toasted one side. I am disabled and didn't return it within one month so now I am stuck with a dud. Do not buy this toaster. I do not usually write reviews especially negative reviews but I am an extremely disappointed with this product.  Perhaps the bagel setting is on permanently.\n \n  Seems to be a quality appliance:  looks well-designed and has a nice weight.  Unfortunately, at level 3 which I thought would be right for an average slice of wheat bread, it only toasted one side of the bread, the side that was facing towards the inside coils.  It is incredible that I cannot find a toaster at a reasonable price that just does the job it's supposed to - brown a piece of bread equally on both sides.\n \n  It was time to replace our Breville toaster.  We had about 5 years of service from it, but despite the high price tag, it was not toasting well.  I searched 2017 reviews for best toasters, and while the Oster wasn't #1 (#1 cost $149!), it was among the top rated.  It doesn't toast well.  Even on level 6 (7 is the top), it barely toasted.  I am disgusted!  It's cute, but that's about it.\n \n  Easy to use,  nice and quiet. Small and takes up minimal space. Toasts evenly  on one side,  but one side toasts darker than the other,  significantly so. Letters on \"cancel\" button are already wearing off and we've had it only about a month. None of it bothers me enough to send it back.\n ", "\n  This is a great toaster!  All my other toasters from big box stores did not toast the bread evenly.  I saw a consumer comparison on America's Test Kitchen show, that rated this toaster the best in the price range.  So decided to give it a try, and it does a great job!  Fits bagels well, too.\n \n  Having had one that took two pushes to slightly toast a bagel, you can imagine my surprise when I burned it the first time with this toaster.  One push at 3 1/2 and I have a perfectly toasted bagel.  Easy to clean, takes up very little room and pretty sturdy.  Very happy!\n \n  This toaster is just a cheap little toaster inside a nice purple outer shell.  It only toasts one side of the bread, so I have to turn it down low, and flip the bread during the toasting.  The little suction cups on the bottom make is stick to the counter, so it's difficult to slide around to clean under it.  The slide handle pulls down hard.\n \n  WorksWorks like a charm excellent toast so you got a watch the temperature settings I\u2019m getting that it\u2019s a great toaster I like it for the color have fun\n \n  You would think a quality toaster would be easy to get, but we went through a few, some very heavy duty ones even, from kitchenaid, and cuisinart and so on. They all overcooked, burnt, or underdid the toast and it was a hassle to deal with. \n  We bought this toaster in November 2018.  It is now defective as of January 2020.  Some wires are broken and the toast is unevenly toasted. One corner will be burned and another hardly toasted.\n \n  These toasters toast more on one side than on the other. I share here photos of the first toaster I received and the replacement I requested: You can see one side of the bread slice and the other. Both toasters had the exact same problem. I'm asking for a full refund. Honestly, I can't believe these toasters passed quality control.\n \n  What a piece of junk, my10 year old black and decker works so much better than this toaster. Within a month the thin metal that hold the bread bent and would not move I straightened it out as much as possible but was afraid it would snap and leave me with a toast that would only toast one slice at a time. It is cheaply made. Do not waste your money on this product. Even from the start I had to flip the bread and toast it twice just to get a brown toasting and it was still uneven.\n \n  USED FOR TOAST,,,NOT EVENLY  ONE SIDE OF TOAST AND NOT SO MUCH THE OTHER SIDE \n  This toaster came packaged very well. Arrived within two days. Worked just as expected, multiple options including a bagel function which I really like. The reason for the 4/5 star is that the knob on the toaster is a bit loose (it's not coming off), I feel like I could break it off if I use it wrong. But otherwise, it's a good toaster.\n ", "\n  As had others, I got sucked in by the positive reviews and my own modest requirements.  Just looking for a basic toaster, nothing fancy, one that would toast evenly (sort of the definition of a toaster).  This unit seemed to be doing the job initially but about 90 days in, it decided to toast one side dark and the other light (as other posts have indicated).  I missed the return window by a week.  Definitely not recommended.\n \n  This is a great basic toaster. I like the color and it doesn't take much space. It toasts slightly uneven, with the top of the bread always getting dark before the bottom even starts to harden. Other than that it's good.\n \n  I'm sending this back. I bought it because of the wire cutter recommendation but it is stuck on the bagel setting since the first time I used it. No matter what I tried it only does bagel which is more toasted on one side than the other. So frustrating trying to find a quality toaster without the extra buttons that inevitably break! I'm really disappointed with this.\n \n  Everything is as pictured as promised! The price is great for what you get too, in my opinion. I needed a quick and easy toaster to use, and that's exactly what I got. So far, there hasn't been any problems! I've owned it for a few weeks now. Will update my review as needed!\n \n  This toasts the bread WAY too much. Where most other toasters I have owned, where I have to set to between 6 and 8 to get a nice dark brown toast, this one burnt the bread at setting 3. It works well enough if set to 1 or 2, but there should be a wider range of doneness for your bread and bagels. I would not recommend.\n \n  The bagel function does not work. Toasts both sides instead of just one. To add insult to injury it also burns both sides if left at the normal toast darkness setting. Normal toasting also is not great, uneven toasting, the two sides are different darkness. Beautiful little toaster if you don't care about function.\n \n  Does. It toast each side evenly. One side will be toasted and other side isn't or you get over toasted on one side and the other side just right. Sent it back.\n \n  This toaster is perfect in every way except it is too small! Drop a regular loaf slice in and the top sticks out the top so it only toasts 85% of the bread. If you only eat English muffins then you will be happy :-)\n \n  Came with a broken lever that would not engage when pressed down so the toast wouldn't stay in.  Also when I tried it for the first time the knob broke off.  Cheap.  Very disappointed.  Oster generally has really good products.  Needs some quality control work\n \n  I thought this would be a better quality toaster. I don't know what the \"life of toaster is to be, but after a year, it is really toasting unevenly, from burnt to raw (see toast photo)!  We use it an average of 3 times a week, typically for one slice of bread. One can see the elements are not very evenly putting out heat. I took pictures of both outer sides (which one is very hot and we usually don't use that slot) and the third picture is the middle elements which barely are on!\n ", "\n  Got this to replace our broken toaster after 10 years... works perfectly for what we need it for! I like having the different button options.\n \n  We've had this toaster a couple months now. It's OK, but it doesn't heat as uniformly as it should and it's not all that fast. When I turn it on and look in, some sections of the filaments glow red, and some don't. I'm happy to have it, but I'm not impressed. I don't understand why it should be difficult to find a toaster that toasts uniformly and quickly. Seems simple enough, but having looked at many toasters and the reviews for them, apparently not.\n \n  Indicator on temperature control knob is, for most purposes, invisible. I had to paint a white line on it. It toasts both sides of a bagel, even tho there\u2019s a special setting for bagels. Also sounds cheap. Otherwise serviceable.\n \n  This toaster is very good. My old toaster got to the point where it was only toasting on one side (it was 25 years old though). I've used this one several times now and it works great. The only thing I haven't tried is the bagel feature but, if there is a problem, I'll post an update. In the meantime, I like the way this one works, plus it's easy to clean and it looks good on the counter.\n \n  I purchased 8 months ago, and today it's in the trash.  One side won't lift the toast and my fear is my children will try to fish it out with a fork while it's plugged in. \n  Right after we purchased this toaster the knob fell off. I didn't want to go through the hassle to return it so we would constantly put the knob back on. About 2 months later toast started to get stuck in the toaster and burn and set the fire alarm off. Now you can see what a total hot mess it is. Don't buy this!\n \n  Nice looking toaster, light weight, easy to use and clean. Reasonably priced. \n  5 stars for a quality build.  2 stars for functionality.  Slowwwwwww, center of bread dried out trying to get to a dark toast.  Get it dialed in on one type of bread and then the next time using a different bread the settings will change.  One side is different doneness than the other.  Is there not a toaster that actually works on the breads available.  Oh,  this ones slots are very small.  I'm not talking about artisan breads but just a usual loaf.\n \n  It won\u2019t make me coffee, wake me up or drive me to work. But this inexpensive little toaster toasts bread consistently well. At least in the brief time I\u2019ve used it. I haven\u2019t had it long enough to judge its durability ir ease of cleaning, so three stars there. \n  I think mine got damaged in shipping. It makes a weird buzzing noise every time I cook something.\n ", "\n  Very cheaply made. It burned my first slices of toast and gave a weird smell. I had it on a low setting. Not best quality but since I don\u2019t use a toaster too often it\u2019s fine. Pick a different model is my suggestion\n \n  Toasting one slice of bread at a time works well with this toaster.  Changing the settings for lighter or darker toast is easy and the results are fairly consistent.  I've only had this toaster a few months but so far, it's been reliable and I am enjoying the flavor of a great slice of toast!\n \n  Does not toast 1 slice of bread evenly on both sides regardless of the slot used.  Does not toast evenly 2 slices of bread at the same time.\n \n  Love it!! Sweet little toaster; toasts well, just need to experiment with settings a bit.  I like my toast on the dark side, so setting 5 is good for me; husband likes lighter, so he sets it about 3.5. Only trouble has been with very thickly sliced homemade bread--fits, as do halved bagels--but had to pry out with wooden spoon after toasted. (Wooden spoon for obvious electrical reason!! Unplug it as well, to be safe.) Haven't tried with frozen pastries though.\n \n  Works well but smell first use. Hope goes away as I use it. Just from being new. I hope.\n \n  Dark gray looks great with my black stainless appliances. Never knew to plug in a new toaster and push the lever down, without adding the bread, so the new heating elements will burn off mgf residue, then, I can add the bread to toast. Even toasting so far\n \n  If I could give this ZERO stars I would. Bottom line, it doesn't work. It is extremely difficult to get the lever to engage to turn the toaster on. We constantly battle with it to get it to stay down. There is no rhyme or reason to when it finally catches and toasts the bread. It's just luck, I guess. I shouldn't need luck when I want a piece of toast. Also the sides get HOT. Really hot. If I could return the toaster I would. Unfortunately, we didn't take it out of the box until after the return window passed. Lesson learned and $30 in the trash. I bought this item with my own money. I did not receive it free or at a reduced cost. If only I could be so lucky...\n \n  Don't usually do reviews but ... Bought this toaster in April., 2019 based upon amazon reviews.  Should have sent it back right away but didn't.  It browns only one side of each slice more often than not. If you attempt to turn the browning up it then burns the toast.  Not the end of the world but not a very good toaster either.\n \n  This toaster worked great until this weekend.  Used it and 1/2 hour later is no longer worked.  Was going to purchase another one but the price keeps going up.  Not worth almost $32 when I originally paid under $20.  I guess I will be on the look-out for another toaster.  No idea what happened to it but the lever will no longer stay down to toast the bread.  You push it down and within 30 seconds it has popped itself up.  Guess this is why it is rated as a budget toaster.  Don't waste your money. There is no warranty that I can locate on it.\n \n  First, control settings knob is to loose will probably come off before long. Second, only toasted one side of the bread, had to take it out, and put in again!  Same as my old one so just as well return this thing and continue to use my old one.\n ", "\n  Easy to clean, good price, has several functions such as toast or frozen, but it doesn\u2019t seem to toast anything without burning or just not getting it quiet done enough. Also makes a buzzing sound while toasting.\n \n  Really bad chemical smell that you can\u2019t really get rid of no matter what you try to do. I wouldn\u2019t buy this again nor would I recommend it\n \n  A very simple, basic toaster.  Browns evenly and pretty quickly.  Really like how the slots are a little longer for today's new breads.  Haven't done any bagels yet because we're mainly toast people.\n \n  Heats on one side and not the other.  Has other settings buttons but doesn\u2019t toast any different.\n \n  This toaster takes forever to toast something! You have to be careful what you turn the temperature to because it'll completely burn your toast without popping up. I had mine set in the middle and it burnt it to a crisp and never popped up. Cheap junk.\n \n  I've had this for about a month, and so far it's working well. Toasts my bread just right. The only thing I could wish is that the knob you turn for lower and higher settings had a more obvious indicator for which number it's pointing to. I don't like turning on all the lights in the morning as I get ready, and sometimes it's impossible for me to see what it's pointing to. That really is a minor complaint though. I can always turn on the light. It just makes me grouchy when I do.\n \n  This has been my best toaster for many years.  I kept getting new ones because they would get dirty and rusty at the top.  This one looks great.  Works fine.  Crumb tray seems a bit deeper so holds more without causing mess.  Good purchase.\n \n  Love this toaster. We have a silver one at home and bought this one for our vacation house. Our silver one has lasted years & is still going with daily use. We expect the same from this one.\n \n  Such a nice looking toaster but when set on the toast setting  it toasted only one side of the bread, and the other side not very evenly.  Returned after three days of testing hoping it would actually toast the bread.  Went to my local national chain drugstore and bought a toaster at half the price that actually toasts both sides of the bread.\n \n  The setting for toast has to be on the highest number to achieve browning.  It does not brown the same on each side, one is lighter than the other.  I replaced a $7 toaster that worked better than this one.  Don't believe the reviews as this toaster is junk!\n ", "\n  This toaster looks very sleek and you can\u2019t beat the value. It works great and is easy to clean.. I would recommend this toaster to anyone. It\u2019s not fancy but it looks more expensive than it is which is nice!\n \n  This is by far the pretties toaster I have ever owned. LOVE it!!\n \n  I mean, it's a toaster. I don't have high expectations. My last toaster survived more than 12 years. If this one can match that, I'll be uber satisfied. \n  I am very pleased with this toaster, but I'll give it four stars because my wife and kids complain about a high pitch sound whenever it's operating. I cannot hear it - one of the benefits of being over 50, I guess.\n \n  Replaced a very disappointing toaster with this one. WOW! what a difference.  Toasts bread, bagels and English muffins evenly without too much fiddling around.  I will recommend this ti anyone who asks.\n \n  The toaster is adequate and looks good.  However, it does not toast evenly on both sides and the two sections toast differently.  I have to pop it half way through and then the bread.\n \n  We just received this and have used it several times.  The toast came out just perfect. I like that it has cool sides during toasting. The toaster is a metallic grey.  It is compact, does not take up too much counter space, and looks good with my black granite counters. This was a highly rated toaster on a consumer comparison site.  So far, I am very pleased with this.\n \n  We bought this toaster about 7 months ago.  We are almost-daily users, most frequently with bread but occasionally with English muffins or bagels.  Bagel setting wasn't great.  The primary problem was that when we pushed down the lever to start the toaster, the lever wouldn't stay down and the toaster wouldn't start.  It was always a little fussy but it has been getting worse.  Today, we had to push the lever down 15 times before it engaged.  Life's too short.  Toaster is in the trash.  No more Oster Toasters for us.\n \n  This is the second time I bought this toaster. I most recently purchased it in September 2018 and it has already broken. I would like a free replacement sent to me.\n Oster TSSTTRJBG1 Jelly Bean 2-Slice Toaster, Grey \n   ", "\n  Great little 2 slicer for your buck. Nothing fancy to go wrong on you. Nice wide slots w/Bagel, Frozen, Toast, Cancel button.\n \n  It started out OK, just OK.  After a few weeks of light usage (1 - 3 x/week), it worked just over unevenly, and just settled in there.  One side of each piece browned faster that the other in each slot.  Gave it to a friend who liked the from factor and was OK with the function....  form over function, and more bagels.  So it has a nice home and I have a competitor product that is awesome, but a lot more money....\n \n  So I waited a long time to write this review. I ordered this toaster back in April of this year and absolutely fell in love, however yesterday it stopped working. No warning, no changes, just doesn\u2019t work anymore. Don\u2019t waste your money on something that lasts six months. I\u2019ll go back to my cheap $10 toaster that\u2019s been working for 10 years.\n \n  It works great. Problem is it has this nasty ringing sound when in use that I can\u2019t stand to be next to.  If noises bother you don\u2019t get this toaster.  After 3 months I decided to get a different toaster that is quiet.\n \n  My previous Oster toaster last for 10 years. It was still functioning but started to have uneven toasting of the bred so we decided it is time to buy another one of the same model. When I reviewed many of the competitors before deciding to buy again the same model, I saw many quality issues on the other competitor's models.\n \n  This product came highly rated on The Wire Cutter and, hence, we bought it. After the warranty expired, the toaster started either blowing the fuse or not working (not catching when pressing the toast shelf). So, we bought it again, thinking we got a defective one. Well, 2 month later, again outside of the warranty, the same things are happening again (fuse and not catching). Maybe it is a coincidence. But I doubt it.\n \n  I had my previous toaster for six years, it was still working great. The only reason I decided to replace it was because it had a build up of residue.  I did a lot of research, and this toaster was at the top of all the reviews. It had a cheap feel to it from the beginning, it only darkens the bread on one side, even regular grocery store bread is too tall, and the mechanism broke after six weeks. A totally design failure!\n \n  Its the perfect size toaster, and it appears to make 'happy' toast thus far. The design is exceptionally pleasing to my eye and would enhance any 'modern' kitchen or a kitchen cook's nook. Its a toaster which takes up a small pach of space. NICE product. [However I am not pleased with how it was delivered to me and hope all will be well].\n \n  This is a bum toaster! It toasts on one side but not the other! I\u2019ve tried both slots and the center always overtoasts and the outer side is hardly toasted. I am not happy with this thing!\n \n  It is smaller than expected and the bread we buy will not completely fit into it. We were also surprised to find that it often burns the ends of the toast. Other than that, it works well enough.\n ", "\n  The only complaint I had was the line on the knob was very difficult to see. \n  The metal in the top and sides gets super hot after using the toaster. Works well for toasting frozen food.\n \n  The side of the bread facing the middle of the toaster get much more heat than the outside. So one side of the bread is dark brown and the other side is still white.\n \n  Works good for toasting regular bread but the bagel function is useless, it burns them to a crisp! Also, the indicator on the dial is very hard to see and the dial feels very loose, as if will fall off at any time. For almost $30 it's total junk!\n \n  Purchased one, defective.  Reordered another, defective.  Trouble with light/dark knob.  Way too loose per Oster.  Sgould be firm.  Went to another store and purchased one\n \n  Nice even toasting of whatever you\u2019re going to toast.\n \n  I got tired of trying to figure out which toaster to buy.  I thought I would have to pay more than this to get a really good toaster.  After getting tired of reading the reviews, I wasn't convinced I should pay a bunch for a toaster, so I bought this one.  It has been a pleasant surprise.  We are very happy with it.\n \n  I love this toaster. It has a nice clean simple look. I have a lot of appliances on my kitchen counters therefore I wanted something small (2-slice toaster). It's perfect and easy to use.\n \n  Needed a small two slice toaster for the RV.  This looked like it was the best bang for the buck on Amazon.  So far it has worked perfectly and doesn't take up to much room.\n \n  The toasting control knob is not very precise; some days a particular setting will hardly brown the toast and some days it will burn. You have to monitor while toasting if you don't want to spoil your piece of bread. Otherwise it does a good job. Let us see how long it will last. My first GE toaster lasted me 15 years, since then I have owned at least 7 toasters and none have satisfied my needs.\n ", "\n  Love the color but it only toasts on one side unless you are using both slots.\n \n  I bought based on the recommendation of The Sweethome review site. Maybe I got a dud. Takes fiddling to get the right darkness and then the results change in a few days. sigh. Does have warm feature which I like. Bagel setting is good for the second toasting of english muffins and hamburger buns\n \n  The temperature settings are a bit fussy but otherwise, I like it a lot. It\u2019s actually an attractive piece and doesn\u2019t seem to get fingerprints all over it.\n \n  DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS TOASTER!  Some design genius sacrificed design for function.  A standard size piece of white bread doesn\u2019t fit - it sticks out about an inch so the top part of the bread doesn\u2019t toast.  So you get part raw bread, or you get to stand there and turn the bread upside down, to get a light toast while the rest of your bread becomes too dark.  Hello - Oster, how can your genius\u2019 be so stupid?  A simple act becomes so frustrating first thing in the AM.\n \n  A vast improvement over my old toaster. The bread actually stays down when the lever is depressed, the settings are accurate, and it's much more versatile.\n \n  The slice of gluten free bread was toasted perfectly evenly. The slots are so wide that you can view  the  side of a normal slice of bread from the top to monitor its doneness. I am very pleased with this purchase.\n \n  bought this for my mom for christmas and she absolutely loved it. she had a previous toaster that broke and she was reluctant to try this one but loves it. she wants me to get another one just in case anything happens to this one!!\n \n  I have found that a toaster is one of those items where the old saying \u201cyou get what you pay for \u201c does not hold true. This toaster is low in price and pretty much as good as the most expensive ones. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s very good\n \n  Nice wide slots for thick toasting\n \n  Awesome toaster. I am a celiac and use a separate toaster. Gluten free bread is kept frozen and this toaster has a frozen setting on it. It's the first toaster (frozen or fresh bread) that toasts the bread evenly. It toasts the GF bread all the way through. Very happy.\n ", "\n  After many years with our previous toaster, we decided we needed a new one - and picked this little guy because of the great reviews it received on Amazon!  We are GREATLY pleased with our purchase!  We have fairly large bread (3 different types in our home) and it works great with all of them (they all fit in just fine) - and it appears that bagels will be no issue either.  It toasts perfectly and evenly. \n  Love everything from the color to the way it operates...and the price was reasonable! I have tried toast and warming hamburger buns in it...works beautifully! Very easy to clean!\n \n  This toaster is way small. Doesn't even hold a traditional slice of bread. That being said...I, unfortunately waited to long to return this toaster.  Lesson learned.  This is a POS.  Most of the heating coils do not work properly if at all \n  Toaster was defective. Handle wouldn't lock into place. Toaster is cheaply made. All the plastics were loose. When reading the instructions I noticed they were written in 2011. Not sure if that's indicative of the age of this product but it sure operated like it was tossed around a few times.\n \n  the bagel feature does not work, it still bakes on both sides as if it were toast. i should have read the reviews, seems to be a problem.\n \n  Looks like zebra toast.  Three bands of toasted bread with white bands in between.  If you're toasting anything shorter than regular bread, pushing the lever up doesn't bring it high enough to remove it.  You need to use a fork to fish it out or you risk burnt fingertips.  I guess you get what you pay for.\n \n  Thoroughly disappointed with Oster on this product. Used the button marked bagel and with no increase in temp, burned on the first use. \n  Nice looking toaster. So far no problems. it has the frozen button that worked great for frozen waffles. Toast came out like toast using the #4 option which is the halfway option. Easy to clean and the color goes well with my GE slate appliances. Will update review if anything changes.\n \n  This brand new toaster toasted well for a month.  Now, only one side of the bread is toasting but the other side does not.  The Amazon.com LLC order record says, \u201cReturn window closed on Aug 30, 2017\u201d  We purchased it after Wirecutter chose as the best toaster! \n  I make my own Portuguese Sweet Bread and it is very delicate. This toaster not only toasts evenly, it warms the already-toasted bread without burning. The sides stay cool, it's easy to clean, and is compact.\n ", "\n  This one is a bit more expensive than other toasters on the market.  However, it's stylish looks give it the appearance of being from THIS century.  The less expensive square metal toasters may work just as well as this one, but they look like they are from the 1970's.  This toaster, to me, is worth the extra money.  It looks more decorative than an old appliance, has many features and functions and is super easy to clean.\n \n  I have read most of 1-2 starred reviews on this toaster. It's cheap, I thought, at least I will not loose too much money. You know what? Toasts are evenly roasted on BOTH sides. One of two: either my toaster is till new and works as intendant, or I am lucky enough to have nicely made example.\n \n  Cheap!\n \n  Bought this toaster through Amazon last month and was pleased with what I got. It's pretty, it doesn't take up a lot of counter space, and it does what it's supposed to do: make toast. That was then. Now, I'm disappointed in this purchase. When looking for a new toaster, the first thing I specified to narrow down the search was a bagel setting. There's a neat button on the toaster for bagels and it lights up when you push it. That would be the extent of what changes. The bread I expected to come out toasted on only one side was thoroughly toasted on both. I assumed I'd screwed up so I tried again, making sure the button was pressed but again I got regular toast. \n  I had a blue version of this in college, and sold it when moving. Regretted it and had to buy another one. Best toaster there is, and the frozen option is perfect for toaster strudels.\n \n  Worked as advertised.  Nice and cool to the touch.  Like the cancel button and wide slots.  Toasts pretty evenly.  Good price.  I'd buy it again.\n \n  My favorite part of this toaster is the button I can push if the toast is getting too dark.  We have a habit of putting the heat up and down because there are several of us who use it....so I find I forget to put it down and then realize - oops too late. So I just watch for when my toast will be just right and push the button.  Perfect. \n  It works as presented and as expected! Best job done is sliced bread which comes out evenly browned the same on both sides, but it is not a set and forget appliance. English muffins,bagels, and similar breads require their own setting so it takes a little trial and error. Otherwise it's a very good toaster; especially for the money.\n \n  First, as another reviewer has experienced, the temperature control knob is so loose and wobbly it seems like it will simply fall off on its own. \n  It had a bad chemical smell when I opened the box. Smell went away after turning it on a couple of times. The slice holders barely fit a small piece of white bread, top sticks out and doesn\u2019t toast.\n ", "\n  I read the toaster comparison article on Amazon and selected this particular toaster as a result.  I couldn't be happier with the decision.\n \n  Just perfect!  I have a fairly large kitchen with several doors, so I was having to traipse back and forth 3 or 4 times to make a poached egg with toast.  I downsized the cooktop area tools, gave away the toaster oven...and I love the new arrangement!  Great big slots for oversized or homemade slices, a bagel setting and even one for \"frozen\" that first thaws and then toasts.  And a nice retro look.\n \n  I\u2019ve received two of these toasters. Returned the first one because it made a high pitch whistling sound while in use. Received the replacement and it does the same exact thing. I really wanted this toaster because of the color but the noise it made was just very annoying.\n \n  Toasted bread or bagels are part of my parents daily breakfast. When their old toaster started malfunctioning, my mom asked me if I could find a replacement. I looked around on Amazon and saw this toaster was highly reviewed. I bought it and my parents are very happy with it!\n \n  This turned out to be one of the worse toaster I've ever owned.  It looks beautiful and a great color but doesn't function well.  After only a month's use the metal piece inside that the toast rests on bent and popped out of the side mechanism.  I fixed it myself but it continues to do the same thing about once a week.  Very disappointed in Oster.\n \n  Lots of choices- easy to use.\n \n  Very pretty and works well.  There is a learning curve... at setting 4, for example, an English muffin will come out warm but not brown, dense wheat bread comes out nicely golden, and white sandwich bread will be dark and crunchy.  So you have to learn which settings you like for the kinds of breads you personally use.\n \n  Really attractive toaster but crumb tray coming out the back is awkward.  One has to pull toaster out & around to access, then back again after emptying tray.  Too many extra steps.  Also tricky to make crisp English muffins since adjuster knob stops short of this option.\n \n  I like it because it offers different feature for toasting, bagel, warm, etc.  I have never tasted a nice perfect crispy toast with my previous toaster.  The tray underneath is easy to remove to clean and put back.  Excellent design.  Thanks\n \n  ...to this toaster. Does exactly what it was made for. The most even toasting of any toaster I\u2019ve ever owned. The controls are straight forward and yield consistent results. I have yet to use the defrost setting but I\u2019m more inclined to have the microwave perform that function so I don\u2019t care if it works or not. Didn\u2019t cost a lot either. Overall I have to ask, what\u2019s not to like? Let\u2019s hear it for the Oster jelly bean, my best friend in the morning.\n ", "\n  My previous toaster was inconsistent in browning and was beginning to burn the toast. We bought this one, but the cheap price had me a little worried. It performs wonderfully however. Consistent browning on both sides of toast and it is smaller than I thought. Smaller than my previous toaster so it fits better in my kitchen space. The different settings are great- toast, bagel, frozen, and warm. I thoroughly recommend it.\n \n  This toaster actually toasts like it's supposed to.  This is the 3rd one I've bought.  I have one at home, work and in the camper.  They all three work exactly the same and are all still working great!\n \n  Either burns or doesnt toast. Toasting takes a LONG time.\n \n  I purchased this to replace an older but identical toaster because it the old one did not toast evenly.  The new one works better but still doesn't toast as evenly as I would like.  Otherwise it works fine, is easy to clean and compact for easy storage out of sight when not in use.\n \n  Runs a little hot and makes a little buzzing sounds while toasting. For the money, it does the job. It\u2019s very basic. If you just need something to toast a slice of bread once in a while, this is fine.\n \n  The bagel setting doesn\u2019t easily work or work at all . I just like bread toasted on one side and the bagel setting did that on my old appliance .  This one looks good for company but I went and got my old one out of the donation box and use it now\n \n  \"even, consistent toasting\" < not quite; both sides of bread are not toasted equally None None None \n  \u00a0This toaster looks nice but doesn't heat up evenly throughout. Some areas heat up nicely and others don't. You have to keep flipping the bread to get it toasted the same on both sides.\n \n  I\u2019ve had this product for barely over a month and already it doesn\u2019t work. I push down the lever and it doesn\u2019t hold to start toasting. At one point I noticed the lever was down, cane back later to realize it wasn\u2019t even toasting. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a default with mine but this is ridiculous. I also don\u2019t like how small the inserts are, I feel like I can barely put a standard slice of bread inside.\n \n  Cancel function  no longer works after one year\n ", "\n  Very easy to use, and is very well made.  The toast has been coming out great every time.  There were so many to choose from, we bought this one because we have had a good experience with an Oster Bread Maker which also was the best we ever had.  Equally good quality on this toaster.  Thank you Oster company, keep up the good work.\n \n  Giving this product one star because it turns on. That's about the only thing it does consistently (and is an improvement over the previous one that died). The slots are not deep enough to fully toast the top of a normal slice of bread. Toast is a different color each time - even on the same setting. Sometimes one side is darker than the other - even on consistent settings. If all you need is a basic toaster, don't bother with this one. It can't even do that basic task well.\n \n  This toaster stoped working after just over 8 months. It was easy to use although it toasted  on one side of the bread better than the other. We like ours light so that didn\u2019t really matter too much. Then one morning I went to push down the lever and it will not stay down to make toast. \n  This works just lovely for my needs. Does a great job toasting and is light enough and small enough that I can store it nearby when not in use.\n \n  Very good toaster. Good quality. Pity it only comes in grey, I have nothing grey or black in my house, except the toaster.\n \n  i loved the smaller size and look , took up less space on my countrer top which is nice. I gave my friend maria my old one i dropped a few times and she was just as happy as i was with my new one. great seller on amazon thanks.\n \n  Well it works, it\u2019s nice looking, but the slots are a little short for my PRE-sliced standard commercial bought bread.  Also doesn\u2019t catch the crumbs, they tend to fall through to counter/floor.\n \n  I thought I was being \"good\" and buying a budget toaster. This thing sucks. It burns one side of the bread-yes, only ONE side gets burned. Wish I had spent more money on something of quality.\n \n  I bought this is April. It is now July and toaster doesn\u2019t work. Nothing about it works. I have no little kids or anyone else using it. It should last longer than this.  It also doesn\u2019t toast well even though it was highly rated on Consumer reports. Don\u2019t buy it\n \n  LOVE IT \ud83d\udc9c it\u2019s beautiful, (fav color is purple), super fancy for being a cheaper toaster. Sounds funny but it toasted my toast perfectly \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n ", "\n  Toasts unevenly and the slots are a bit short....but it is a nice compact size, the body remains cool after toasting and the controls are fast to respond.\n \n  The temperature is inconsistent. The toasted area is smaller than the slice of bread. The slot that you place the bread into doesn\u2019t go down far enough. \n  I really like this toaster for its color and it\u2019s compact size. But it doesn\u2019t toast evenly on both sides of my toast. I consider this a minor problem bec I just turn the bread around and toast for another minute. For me, that\u2019s not a problem. Otherwise this toaster is very easy to use. I don\u2019t eat bagels but I think the slots are wide enough to hold half a bagel.\n \n  Just over two years old and it died today.  No reason, just completely stopped working. It worked fine while it lasted, but if you\u2019re looking for a product that will hold up long term, avoid this toaster.  Guess they don\u2019t make them like they used to, and I have to buy a new one after two years.\n \n  This is one of the best toasters that I've ever used.  It is easy to use and easy to toast bread properly with. The different settings for toasted white bread or English Muffins are easy to change, from one to the other,...and the settings are set to toast whatever product this is used on with proper results..\n \n  I love this toaster! The build quality is really solid, which can't be said for all the other toasters I looked at in this price range. Very often all the buttons feel like they are one press away from falling off and the lever seems like you could just snap it off if you twitched while using it. This is not the case for this guy. The only complaint I have about it is the slots are relatively small so it doesn't fit all shapes and sizes of bread. I see this as part of the form factor more than a defect of the toaster though. The purple color is really nice too! Goes great with my kitchen and I get compliments on it.\n \n  I love it. I hate being shallow but it's as shiny as a purple roadster at a car show with a chrome engine purring under the hood. And it works too! It toasts far more evenly and quickly than the humble white Oster toaster I got as a gift four years ago. The photo really does not do it justice. I feel bad for people who are unhappy with it but my experience is that they may be the kind of people that lock themselves in a restroom in a public park and scream for their release when all they have to do is lift the latch. It's a toaster. It's not that hard people.\n \n  Nice wide openings and the extra lever action that allows you to push the toast up for easier removal. great price too!\n \n  I love all things purple! And this looks absolutely amazing in my kitchen. Adjustable temp. Easy to clean.\n \n  This toasts well and is pretty easy to empty crumbs. I just hat that the cord is just there. Nothing to wrap it around or keep it organized\n ", "\n  The toaster is less than 2 years old & only browns on 1 side no matter what slot I use.  Also I have to have the temperature up really high to just get a little color.\n \n  Returned 2 of these. Each toasted one side of the bread but not the other. Nice looking, fairly well made so I was disappointed.\n \n  Overall I like this toaster, the only thing that I did not realize is that it does not fit rye bread.\n \n  Bought this toaster to replace an old chrome one I had. This is a standard toaster that toasts great.\n \n  The lever broke after less than two months of use. We liked the toaster while it was working, but it didn\u2019t last long.  Warranty service is a joke. We\u2019ve been waiting months for a replacement toaster. Terrible product and horrible customer service.  I won\u2019t ever buy another Oster product.\n \n  The only good thing that I can say about it is that it looks nice. It is useless because the toasting is extremely uneven.\n \n  Can't imagine how Oster, an old and trusted company, can offer this toaster at its retail price and still make a profit.  Great looking, wonderfully effective, well designed.  Buy it!\n \n  I purchased this because I had another Oster toaster that worked really well.  This one however doesn't.  It doesn't toast anywhere near evenly on both sides.  However it is inexpensive so I won't feel too bad throwing it out when I am tired of the inconsistent toasting.\n \n  When using one side the outside burner doesn't toast\u2757 It doesn't matter which one you use, both do the same thing\u2757 Going to look into returning it. The thing is, it did not do this the 1st couple times I used it\u2049\n \n  Nice toaster, the temperature adjustment is delicate to get a light brown color.  But a nice toaster especially to remove \"crumbs\".\n ", "\n  Great toaster.  Just like one we had for 5 years but I ruined the old one by stuffing something in that I should not have; can't remember what.  Anyway one of the parts broke.  But, it lasted at least 5 years so how can I complain?  This is the same model just updated with new, cooler look and better functioning parts.  Buy it now!\n \n  I like most of features but the warm feature doesn't really warm for example a slice of a quick bread.  I fooud a low toast setting to be more effective.  I would alos recommend as the directions state for your first few ties using the toaster to place it in a well ventilated area(outside) and depress the toast function a few times until the excess whatever burns off,. It emits a string ordor.\n \n  I've had this toaster for a while and it works great, continued good even heating, bagels and toast both come out ideally toasted\n \n  Great Toaster! Replaced the old one we had for 10 years (actually the same exact one -different color). Old one wouldn't come clean, so I decided to finally get a new one, but the old toaster still worked great.\n \n  But a bit flimsy. Sometimes I have to push a  wire back into pace  ignorer to ouch the bread down to be toasted. But I love it.\n \n  It is annoying and dangerous. It caused a power surge and began to smell terribly and during this, the lever to enable bread to toast, refused to stay down in position. Just an awful experience.\n \n  This is a fantastic toaster, it does everything as described in the advertisement and the price was great.  It looks expensive but it's not.  I would recommend it anytime.\n \n  Very nice little 2 slice toaster. Doesn't take up much space on counter top. works great.\n \n  Read reviews for this toaster & decided this was the best bet for us, size wise & price wise.  The problem is/was that toast came out barely toasted on one side & burnt on the other no matter which slot we used or the temperature control setting.  Have to send it back & toast in the oven broiler until we can get a suitable replacement.\n \n  It works really well for an affordable toaster. It looks nice on the countertop as well.\n ", "\n  2 years and still going strong. So far has outlasted every toaster I've purchased since 1992 by more than a year (I like my toast)\n \n  have limited space kitchen. this is great fit. \n  This toaster has broken already, the lever one pushes to keep the bread down while toasting will not stay down.  Now I am unable to return it as I am 1 day past the 3 months.  Very unhappy with this product\n \n  Lowered my initial review.  Browns less evenly than when first used and the bagel setting now toasts BOTH sides of the bagel (not what I wanted).\n \n  So this toaster looks nice, seems well enough constructed, and cleans easily, BUT it doesn't function properly! I have to manually turned the slice of bread so that both sides actually get toasted. If I don't, only one side gets done. This is a royal pain, and I would return it if I made a lot of toast...luckily I only use it a couple times a week for only myself.\n \n  Works flawlessly. Great addition to my work apartment. Highly recommend this product\n \n  Its a toaster, it toasts things. I got it to replace my old Oster toaster which had quit after 10 years.\n \n  The toaster at work sucked - nothing would ever toast! so I bought this in purple. At home I have a previous model in red and we love it. The new one for work works perfectly just like my other one does, and everyone is so happy that their toast toasts and the purple color brightens up their morning :)\n \n  Continuing the above headline, \"at the same time (adequately)?\" \n  Great Toaster, toasts to perfection every time. Very easy to use and intuitive.\n ", "\n  Controls difficult to see. The Lift feature does not lift the toast high enough to easily pick up the toast. \n  I really like the appearance, but it doesn't toast the bread evenly on both sides.  The inside is always darker than the outside.  Honestly, how hard can it be to design a toaster that actually toasts!\n \n  knob that changes darker to lighter toast is a little loose. Took a lot of adjusting to get darkness right - still not very consistent though. I'd say it's an okay toaster.\n \n  This is a great little toaster with all the features you need and none of the crazy stuff you'll never use.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the countertop.\n \n  When I got the toaster it looked flimsy, but worked perfectly. After only 6 months of proper use it just stopped working. I requested a refund, hope Oster won't be too hard to handle.\n \n  Beautiful color. Unique for those who love purple and there's a great collection of other kitchen appliances to match at great prices on Amazon. To be honest, I couldn't find them anywhere else, but on Amazon. So go for it!!\n \n  Once in a while top portion of bread didn\u2019t brown. Works pretty well most of the time\n \n  I bought this toaster because I wanted a smaller toaster. However not a fan on how it toasts. Either you have it go down twice to get an even toast or it burns it. The frozen setting works fairly well.\n \n  It's so cute that it makes up for a lot of shortcomings.  English muffins take more than a full cycle to toast and the edges burn while the middle is not quite finished, bread slices toast unevenly, but I'll put up with all of that because I love the way it looks on my countertop.  But if I were a real toast lover who needed a perfect slice every morning, I'd buy something else.\n \n  Works great. It's the first toaster I've ever owned (I usually use a pan), but it's fast. It sort of makes a slight high pitched noise while it toasts, but it's not terrible.\n ", "\n  I used it 3 times and it burned up.\n \n  This isn't the fanciest toaster but it looks great, the gunmetal colored body is actually metal and stays cool. But the toast. The toast is nicely \"dry\"  so you get a great crunch with this toaster! We had two Warings that died and the toast was never so crunchy. Good buy, very happy.\n \n  Had a weird smell the first time I turned it on as if I was burning plastic but there was nothing inside. It works pretty well now tho I use it every morning for my waffles.\n \n  Love this toaster. Works great and is easy to use. Looks great in my kitchen.\n \n  Great toaster and love the shade of purple. It has many settings for you and doesn't burn bread. Easy to clean and perfect size as well\n \n  I like it.  It toasts.  Just right.  I cook English Muffins on the Bagel setting and it gets them nice and crispy . It does its job very well.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Yes, recommend to others.\n \n  My old Oster toaster worked better when I threw it out. Cute design but never toasts both sides evenly, only toasts one side. No it's not on the bagel setting.\n \n  The toaster must be turned up so high to toast both sides of the bread that one side ends up burned. Definitely not worth the frustration.\n \n  This is a nice looking toaster. I can\u2019t speak to how it toasts because I didn\u2019t make it that far. I have to return it because it makes a very high pitched noise that is pretty awful when the lever is pushed down. It makes no difference what setting it is on.\n \n  I returned this product because it could not fit a full piece of bread, the top of normal off the shelf bread does not go down far enough to be heated. This seems to be a fad as 3 other highly rated toasters had the same issue or perhaps bread slices have gotten bigger...\n ", "\n  only issue i have is the depth of the slices. top pieces of bread do not submerge all the way into the toaster. overall product is good!\n \n  This is a great  toaster,small sleek design. The biggest plus is it toasts quickly and evenly!!\n \n  Obviously cheap, made to break construction. Temperature control failed after a few months, would not turn on after 6 months.  Waste of time and money.\n \n  The manufacturer's pic tells the tale: that is how much of my bread sticks up WHILE it is toasting. I have to cut the slice in two, or it doesn't fit all the way into the toaster.  I think of it as the world's first Diet Toaster, because it has cut the amount of bread I consume in half. \n  Bagel function hasn't worked since it was new right out of the box. All of the heating elements run at full power when the lever is down, whether the bagel button is pressed or even held down, no dice. Looks good but doesn't work for bagels. I eat toast or bagels almost daily so it gets 1 star from me. Oster isn't what it use to be and they need to step of their quality control.\n \n  I love the frozen button that helps toast frozen waffles. It\u2019s great!!!\n \n  Originally rated this 4 stars... downgraded to 3 because the button labels and lettering are disappearing. Everything is junk these days; get off my lawn; and so on...\n \n  I've only had it a couple days but it works great and looks stylish. Only downside is the crumb catcher is in the rear so you have to turn it around to clean it and the cord comes out the side not the back so it's a bit in the way.\n \n  Love my toaster; use it almost every morning; controls works great; I like my toast really brown and it does it perfectly\n \n  good sized, heats well and is wide enough for a nice sized bagel half.\n ", "\n  Love the color and so far love that it works the way it should. Granted we have had this for a little over a month but it does what it needs to and me personally...I LOVE THE COLOR!!!\n \n  THE ONLY NEGATIVE WAS THE TOP OF THE TOAST DOESN\"T GO ALL THE WAY DOWN>\n \n  Love this toaster.  Came in pristine condition and is a quality toaster.  Gets used every morning and makes the toast from light to very well done; however  you like it.  Glad I took a chance on it!  Thanks.\n \n  Does the job and makes toast...well toast! It\u2019s easy to use and clean. No issues with the temperature controls. Good purchase!\n \n  Waited to write this review until I tryed it.....This is the\"Perfect\" no frills toaster ever and adds a splash of color to a rather dull Kitchen\n \n  A great little toaster. Works well with pop tarts, bagels and bread.\n \n  Nice adjustments and does a decent job. Still has the typical significant difference in toasting level between starting cold and the following cycles. Given the price of fancy quartz toasters that supppsedly don't suffer from this I am sticking with a setting increase for the first batch. Controls feel solid and surface finish is pleasing (and looks nicer than the price).\n \n  This product is not very good. The bread (slice) does not go down into the toaster far enough and as result only bottom part of toast is toasted. This is a cheap product\n \n  The FROZEN button works well with Eggos. Only complaint is the spring does not pop the food items up high enough to get the food out easily I have to lift the lever up when its done to get a good grip on the toasted items.\n \n  Why are toasters so difficult? This one does not toast evenly on both sides and it makes an awful high pitched noise when the toaster knob is depressed.  We can alleviate the sound if we manually hold the knob down while toasting. Lastly, we should have thought about longer slices, they don't fit.\n ", "\n  Great little toaster for someone like me who has limited counter space.  And in my favorite color, too!\n \n  Makes even toast with a lot of settings. Looks more expensive than it is.\n \n  I got this to replace toaster that also had a bagel button that did not work.  Brand new and this one does not work.  Dont waste your money on this.\n \n  It's so much better than the one we had before -- I guess I just didn't know what I was missing. The settings produce expected results, it's easy to clean, and I even like the way it looks.\n \n  I bought this based on great reviews, but there were 2 big problems. 1) The outside of the toaster gets very hot after a single use even on a low setting. Our old toaster never did this. With our whole family using it (small kids included) this was not ok. 2) It also produced a strong odor. I ran it several times to see if it went away, but it didn't.\n \n  Lastee about 1.5 years, now makes a high pitched sound when pushed down and smells of burning plastic or something\n \n  If you put the setting on the highest level (6) and toast the bread twice, it gets light brown.  The toaster I received was utterly useless and returned.  I had to repackage and ship a toaster!  What a pain in the butt.\n \n  This toaster has good temperature control/toast control and works as it should.  It looks nice in the counter but I choose to put it away most of the time.  Love it.\n \n  Great product Nice design, easy to use. Very functional. I'm glad I brought it\n \n  Toasts only one side of the bread.  I wouldn't have bought it if I had known it came from Sunbeam. Two previous Sunbeam toasters had the same problem.\n ", "\n  The color is so deep and lustrous that it's a gorgeous site in the morning. And it works very well. A good sturdy toaster, so far. Had it three months and haven't noticed any problems.  But to be absolutely frank, I bought this more for the color than the ratings, which were happily also very good.  Oster has a strong reputation, which was reassuring. \n  I was surprised and disappointed to discover that this toaster--at least the one that I purchased--only toasts one side a piece of bread.  As I have little cooking experience, I even did a reality check on Google to confirm that this is not the way a toaster should operate.  I have lived with this annoyance because it was too much of a hassle to return.\n \n  We weren't looking for anything spectacular or life changing here. We just need to replace a broken toaster. It did that.\n \n  very reliable.  perfect toast on bread, english muffins, bagels.  a great home appliance.\n \n  Works like a champ - cool outsides. Thick bagels don't quite go down to the bottom when inserted in the toaster, so there is sometimes an under-browned part right at the top. Try lighter settings first - dark is charred!\n \n  I love this toaster.  Looks good on the counter and easy to clean.\n \n  great color,  the slots are wide enough but not very deep, so some breads and bagels don't get toasted on the top edge.  minor problem\n \n  Great little toaster...does it's job very well and is very colorful!\n \n  This is my office toaster and I use it almost daily. The small size makes it perfect for the small space. The toasting may take a little longer than some other models, but the end result is always nice and consistently toasted. It is frequently complimented based on the shiny purple exterior.\n \n  Great but the Bagel button browns both sides. Looks great, modern. Like color. Toasts pretty quick compared to others we have had. Would buy again.\n ", "\n  Nice look. Nice size. \n  This is the best toaster you can get for the price.  The toast comes out even and tastes great.  The only complaint I have is the crumb tray is sometimes a challenge to re-insert into the toaster.  I think the tray is slightly warped, so you have to fiddle with it.\n \n  I gave 2 stars for temp control since the bagel button does not do anything at all except light up. Great for toast, but not bagels.\n \n  I have had this toaster over 6 months now and it works as well as the first day. It isn't too big for the counter and I love the color.\n \n  Uneven toasting of bread. Basically, the bread is only toasted by inner heating elements so your bread is only toasted on one side in either slot. Would not recommend.\n \n  We ordered this model and the first one smoked immediately upon trying it. Easy and super quick exchange for another one that works great with daily use. Toasts quickly, so it took some tries to find our favorite settings was the only adjustment. Looks great in the kitchen.\n \n  toasts unevenly. still tastes odd, like chemically.\n \n  Works decent but cooks uneven. I can't seem to find a toaster that toasts evenly on both sides, but this one isn't too bad. Some others have burned one side and left the other almost totally untouched...\n \n  I've only had it a week but my bagels fit great, I love the different settings even though I mostly use toast. It's my first new toaster in a decade and so far I love it.\n \n  Works great and stylish. Gave to my daughter. I myself have had one for over 10 years and still looks and works great!  Worth the price.\n ", "\n  I should have done the math. Based on reviews, 10% of these toasters are defective right out of the box. Which was the case with the one that I purchased and had to return. For me, the toaster I purchased only toasted one side of the bread for one slot and had spotty toasting on one side of the bread in the other slot.\n \n  Best toaster ever. The outside doesn't get too hot even when you use it several times in a row. It's easy to clean. Great features. Very even toasting.\n \n  This toaster heated evenly and had wide enough slots for bagels.  However, after only 3 months the latch quit working.  I am currently holding the latch down with a heavy pan while trying to get Oster to replace under warranty.\n \n  My toaster is 2 weeks over 1 year old. For a great deal of the time it would not toast both sides evenly. Additionally, one time a setting of 4 would cause burnt toast, next time setting of 4 might only VERY slightly cause any browning!! And, of course, there's the fact when the toast popped out it shot it 3 feet from the toaster. Horrible product!!\n \n  Very sleek, great quality, good temperature control. I love it\n \n  I love this toaster. It roasts waffles and toast evenly. The crumb tray could be deeper in my opinion to avoid spilling crumbs. But, it\u2019s not a problem if you empty frequently.\n \n  Good basic toaster.  Overpriced, but they all are.\n \n  I wanted something simple, easy to clean and use. I found it! This was a great purchase. I use it for my daily toast and hubby uses it for his everything bagels. I would buy again!\n \n  It's a toaster; it does the job. However, after awhile the lever to push down the bread gets loose and you have to push down a couple of times for it to click into place. It is also hard to clean crumbs out of.\n \n  Order this item in Nov 2017 the colour is great. But the toaster does not work anymore, Just stop working in Jan of 2018. Only used it for a few months. Poor Quality will never buy again.\n ", "\n  Other than this toaster being appealing  to the eye....there is nothing good about it. It toasts completely unevenly, one side is burned while other side is uncooked. It makes a loud humming sound while in use. Aways have burned food!\n \n  Read the one-star reviews as they do a good job of summarizing what is wrong with this toaster. Watch out for items that have 10% or more one and two-star reviews.\n \n  Fastest toaster I ever had. Perfect each time\n \n  Love my new toaster!  You should get one.\n \n  Doesn't toast as evenly as more expensive models.  Defrost and reheat/warm features are nice!\n \n  Works well. Wide slots for bagels etc.\n \n  Works just as advertised. Like most toasters, it helps to let it cool a bit between used to ensure consistent toast darkness. But it's very consistent.\n \n  This is a nice toaster for bread, English muffins and bagels. It is a good basic toaster.\n \n  It's a good toaster at a decent price.\n \n  Toasts on evenly. One side burn the other side almost burned.\n ", "\n  LOVE THIS toaster I could never find a purple one till Amazon!!! AWESOME color still working great\n \n  We wanted something smaller for our counter and this was perfect. Very compact and neat. Perfect toast every time. Great purchase.\n \n  Have had this now for over a month and so far no issues with the temperature control or using it for variety of breads such as regular toast, bagels, or gluten-free toast. Good product with a fair price.\n \n  I love this has to be the prettiest purple I have ever seen perfect for my purple and stainless steel kitchen\n \n  Great looking compact Toaster, works well.\n \n  Cannot get consistent toast. Either not toasted at all or burned on the same settings.\n \n  I bought this toaster to replace another that worked, but didn't toast well.  The only upgrade in this toaster is that the toaster itself looks better.  Toasting is inconsistent, darker/burnt on one side, light on the other; different results on the same setting with same bread; bagel setting is no different than toast setting. I would have returned it, but I had thrown away the old one.\n \n  Nice toaster for the price. It does a great job giving that golden brown.\n \n  Yjis toaster lasted just 4 months.  The lever wont stay down unles I stand there and hold ot down.  Shoddy product.  Dont but...Rum and save your mony\n \n  Very poor quality control it seems.  Only about half of the elements come on  which gives a very uneven toast.  I sent the first one back for an exchange, but the second one I received was actually worse so I returned that one too and will have to try a different model or brand.\n ", "\n  I, too, bought this toaster after it was recommended on The Sweethome. \n  Love it - works great, very happy with the quality and ease of use.\n \n  It doesn\u2019t toast all the way to the top.  I find myself having to flip my toast mid way.\n \n  Sleek toaster with nice look, heats relatively evenly. Has extensive features and settings.\n \n  This toaster is no different from my previous toasters. One side of the toast is much darker than the other. \n  So far so good.  I bought this because I have owned Oster items before and found that their customer service was excellent when I had a problem with something I purchased.  In this prior situation, they replaced it with one of their top models after 2 didn't function correctly.\n \n  Nice toaster! Dose as it should!\n \n  Inexpensive model and you get what you pay for.  Many slices of bread won't fit into the openings.  Frozen waffles don't fit top to bottom so the top just gets soggy unless I pop it up and rotate the waffle.  Otherwise fine.\n \n  The bagel function ( toast one side only) stopped working the day after the return window closed.  Amazon issued a credit anyway - Thank you.  I will replace it with a different brand.\n \n  Does it\u2019s job. Had a weird smell at first but works awesome.\n ", "\n  I had a problem with this toaster toasting very light one one side and dark on the other. I returned it and got a replacement which has the same issue.\n \n  Great toaster. Might be challenged by wide bread. Even toasting. Good controls. Happy with the color, because I'm a Washington Huskies fan.Much more deep and metallic than picture shows. This Oster toaster is the most-er.\n \n  Toasts bread well, and larger slices fit in easily.\n \n  The toaster was working well for 3 weeks until out of nowhere stopped working. The return window it's closed.\n \n  Great toaster for the money. The \"smallish\" size is perfect for our limited storage capacity. Works as advertized.\n \n  Looks great matches our appliances well and works as expected.  Quick set buttons help with proper toasting\n \n  Overall it is a toaster! and cheap! \n  I'm surprised I like the black toaster but it is easy to clean and it never looks dirty the toast really great to I locked all the features that has on it I hope it will last me long time\n \n  Looks really good and for the price it can't be beat. Love the frozen setting for waffles\n \n  After reading several reviews, i went and ordered this brand and product. ", "\n  Everything you want in a toaster\n \n  Toast comes our perfect and even.\n \n  I gave this as a gift and they could not be more pleased. I would get one for myself if I needed a new toaster. Nice looking too.\n \n  Dislike the uneven toasting!  Expected more from a Oster brand appliance!\n \n  You get what you pay for.\n \n  Amazing and cheap price. Get it\n \n  toaster will not lock in a down position of handle because bread crumbs get stuck.I have taken this toaster apart twice to remove bread crumbs from the magnetic latch.\n \n  Slots are not long enough. Maybe a square of crappy Wonder Bread will fit in this toaster, but a proper sliced loaf only fits vertically with half the piece sticking out.\n \n  Looks good.  Has worked well on all settings.  Good buy.\n \n  Works perfectly so far.\n ", "\n  Love the toaster  , look good  and sows the work  my only concern it gets way too heated  maybe it\u2019s because of the cheap materials so far no further issue , note maybe if you are a heavy toaster user  this will not be for you ..\n \n  I like this toaster. It matches slate appliances and looks nice \n  I love this toaster- it toasts evenly acrossed each individual bread slice front and back, and it toasts evenly throughout the multiple additions in a row- My old toaster would darken with each additional round of toast- so the 5th and 6th slice were DARK brown or burnt, but the 1st and second were light brown.\n \n  vesratings speak for themssel\n \n  Girlfriend loves it ... \"coolest toaster ever\"!  Gets 5 stars for great looks and \"cuteness\"... \n  It\u2019s great for toast,  ma\u2019am, and I\u2019m sure bagels too. Just haven\u2019t tried yet \ud83d\ude0a \n  Very average for a toaster\n \n  The only thing I dislike is that is is not very solid feeling, very lightweight which hopefully doesn't mean it wont last long.\n \n  Just received this toaster and I am going to return it.  It only toasts bread on one side!!  All heating elements are lighting up, but bread gets nice and brown on one side only - other side is barely colored.  And yes, it is on the \"toast\" setting, not the \"bagel\" setting.  I bought it because it was highly rated in wirecutter.com.  Not feeling too great about them, either.\n \n  Easy for my kids to use!! Light weight and great temperature control!\n ", "\n  A little more expensive than others but worth the money.\n \n  Nice toaster, works good even on bagels.  We like it.\n \n  The best toaster for the money! More expensive models are ridiculously overpriced, as this does all that you need and looks good on the counter-top. I'm glad I got rid of my old toaster oven, which was a pain to clean & dried out my toast anyway. Highly recommended\n \n  Toasts pretty evenly, good options.\n \n  JUST WHAT I NEEDED\n \n  Works great and wide enough for bagels\n \n  It Just Doesn't Toast Evenenly.!  One side is good and Not the other. Which is Not good. Wife and I,  R so Disappointed . We Love Oster Products, Normanly. Maybe, just a Lemon..... l guess, we'll just keep flipping the Toast around.  Mr. & Mrs. Flipper!\n \n  A good size for me; I\u2019m a household on one; it\u2019s a good size for me. Toasts bagels well without burning.\n \n  OK if you only want to toast standard grocery store bread.\n \n  It just as it described.  Perfect\n ", "\n  Broke within 2 months. Plastic piece inside that holds the arm down broke off. Oh well. Glad I didn't pay alot for it.\n \n  Not high heat\n \n  Bought this for a friend for her birthday and she just loves it\n \n  Takes too long to toast the bread!\n \n  works ok but not the best\n \n  Nice toaster for the price.\n \n  Works well\n \n  I think a product rated so highly should last longer than 4 months.  I bought this in November and it gave up the ghost in March. The latch wouldn't stay down to allow the bread to be toasted.  I'm very disappointed and angry at this waste of my money.\n \n  cool looking easy storage works great\n \n  Average, same issue as with every toaster I have had, despite all claims to even toasting it does not--despite all of the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Too much trouble to return and is ok.\n ", "\n  Broken after using it 6 times, the tray is stuck and won't go down. What a waste of money!\n \n  I exchanged it for a different one with wider slots\n \n  Works as described.\n \n  At first it is easy to want to send this toaster back. Bread slices are unevenly toasted, it is hard to see the mark on the knob that you turn to dial the toasting settings and what you think are the correct settings turn out to be too hot or not hot enough. But break in the toaster including running it on the highest setting without bread to get the wires worked up. I found the higher settings for bagels and muffins to work okay and after a few more weeks bread came out okay also. More expensive, heavy duty units no doubt will do a better job but for $30 this one is okay.\n \n  I love this\n \n  We have had a few months and it started making a weird electric noise while heating up. Still using it but the sound kinda bugs me at times.\n \n  Makes a high pitched noise when it's toasting\n \n  Started making strange sounds after just a few months of use. Ended up just throwing it away.\n \n  Best toaster I've ever had!! Love it. Perfect color perfect toasting.\n \n  Great\n ", "\n  It looks great in the kitchen and has worked well.  I love this product!\n \n  This toaster does its job well!  After reading reviews, I decided on this toaster and am very happy with it.\n \n  First time I used it, it smelled kind burning chemicals so not sure if you need to clean it first.  Simple toaster, fits anywhere and works great!\n \n  Sleek dark finish, takes up very little space on your counter so I can leave it out.  Love it so much better than the 4 slice toaster we replaced.  Great for two people.\n \n  I use to reward myself. I love whole wheat toast. Yummy!\n \n  This toaster has cooked uneven since I bought it and after almost two years it just quit working.\n \n  Great toaster\n \n  It looks good and works well.\n \n  This toaster has performed well and consistently makes nicely toasted bread, bagels and frozen waffles.  We are very pleased with this product.\n \n  Good taster\n ", "\n  I got the purple, and it's the prettiest toaster I've ever seen! Lol. Works great too.\n \n  LOVE LOVE my PURPLE toaster!!!!  Not only does it work very well-  perfect toast just the way I like it--- but it added class to my kitchen!!!!\n \n  I bought this based on the Reviews and my fellow purchasers did not fail. This is a nice toaster and for the money works works better than some more expensive ones we've had. It's also a lot faster than our old toaster when every minute counts.\n \n  Great product for the price\n \n  I am so disappointed in this toaster! I read all the reviews and decided on this one and after 6 weeks, both sides started browning my toast unevenly.  This started happening 2 weeks ago (thus 6 weeks) just after the return window closed! I wanted to complain to the company but there is no contact info!  Junk.\n \n  Nice looking works VERY well. You won't be disappointed.\n \n  Great product , used in kitchen\n \n  Love the color. Works like a toaster should. After using mine, I bought one for a house warming gift and they loved it too.\n \n  Nothing special about this cheap toaster except of its color. Does not toast even but I am not going to pay about $100 for a good toaster. Basically, you got what you paid for. Have been using it for couple of months, still works.\n \n  Works as expected.\n ", "\n  I love the color purple, and this toaster is a rich dark purple.  It toasts perfectly.  Item arrived packages well and on time.  Recommend this seller.\n \n  Bought this toaster 6 months ago and the settings have already rubbed off, and I don't even use it everyday. I can't read which setting is for toast, bagel, frozen, etc. If you buy this toaster, you also need to buy a label maker.\n \n  Not all slices fit into this toaster, specifically larger sliced pieces of bread.  You have to manupulate it into the toaster.  Sometimes the toaster doesn't toast evenly on both sides.  Otherwise all else is good.\n \n  Does its job. Looks good.  The black finish on this is really nice...\n \n  This product toasts VERY unevenly.  When set so front side is perfectly toasted - the back side of the bread is not toasted at all.  When set so the back side is perfectly toasted - the front side is burnt black!  We tried this in first one slot, then the other.  The results were the same.  Totally unacceptable.\n \n  Love this toaster and it goes very well with my slate appliances.\n \n  I love my Oster Jelly Bean Purple Toaster. I've used it several times and everything works great. My toast comes out just how I like it and I love the purple color. I think it looks great in my kitchen.\n \n  Put this unit into our AirBnB cottage... guest love it. We feel safe because it's cool to touch.\n \n  We are happy.\n \n  Tuesta bien, muy bonita pero se da\u00f1\u00f3 muy r\u00e1pido como para lo que la us\u00e9 . Solo tostaba tortillas y no era todos los d\u00edas que la usaba. Oster se supone que es buena marca y para el precio pienso que ten\u00eda que durar un poco m\u00e1s.\n None ", "\n  Great quality and nicely made\n \n  Love the color. It's the first toaster I've had where the frozen setting actually cooks a waffle with no cold spots.\n \n  This toaster burns one side and lightly toasts the other. Hard to see what number it is set on.\n \n  Top drawer with beautiful design and finish - pretty worthless as functional piece of equipment.  One grid on each side of elements not working,  inconsistent toasting.  But what was I thinking - I should have measured bread size.  What's a toaster that can only toast short pieces of bread anyway?  Wish the designers used these in their homes - just perhaps things might change.\n \n  This is a great toaster - I've had some bad experiences with other brands but this one both looks sleek and works great\n \n  I bought this for my 86 year old mother. She was terrified of getting a new product and not being able to operate it. This is a great looking toaster, and is easy to operate.\n \n  So far no problems & working well.\n \n  Not only is this an adorable toaster, but it also works great. We really like the pop of color it adds to the kitchen. The settings are so nice for toasting specific  breads (bagel, toast, frozen and warm).\n \n  Only toasts the bottom half of the bread/bagel, even though the food will clearly go all the way down and therefore should be receiving heat.\n \n  Very flimsy and lasted only 3 weeks,\n ", "\n  Matches our black stainless appliances pretty close. Seems to work just fine.\n \n  The outside wires stopped heating.  I have to run bread slices through it twice, to toast both sides.\n \n  It does it's job well and turns my bread into toast. So far it hasn't burned down my apartment which is a plus. 10/10 would buy again.\n \n  Great toaster\n \n  Everything great except that the slots are too short for most bread slices :(\n \n  I love everything about this toaster - the design, the versatility, the options, the fact it actually toasts well (our previous ones didn't)...even the price. Our home aide was so impressed she bought one, too.\n \n  why cant they make it work on both sides of the bread..wow we can go into space,why not even toast..huh\n \n  Received this toaster on February 7, 2019.  Today, June 1, 2019 the bread won't stay down.  It responds like it is not plugged in, but it is and the power light is on.  The window for product support ended in May.  Total usefulness of this item was about 3 months.\n \n  Great toaster & works good. Love the color. Fits my kitchen theme very well. Would buy from them again. Wish they had one w/ 4 slice ability.\n \n  Just what the toaster was advertised to do. I needed it for a small space in the kitchen and it works fine but can get very hot to the touch . I suggest placing it on a small tray and using the lower heat settings. It works quicker and I have never had a problem.\n ", "\n  very easy to use.\n \n  It broke after only about 5 uses. I can\u2019t push the handle down at all anymore, so it won\u2019t turn on. One side isn\u2019t moving.\n \n  Good toaster\n \n  Smoke whenever in use.\n \n  Compact but does the job for less\n \n  It functions well but the slots are shallow ie. A normal slice of bread sticks outof the top about 3/4\u201d.  Why they would design it like this is a mystery.  So I\u2019m not much of a fan.\n \n  Great buying experience. Replacing a similar toaster so expected the product to meet my needs.\n \n  Most perfect toast ever! Evenly toasted to perfection. Openings could be a tad wider for bagels, but it's still good.\n \n  My mother loves the color purple. Oster is a great brand so this really was a no brainer for us. It works well and looks great!\n \n  The service was very good - prompt and without hassle.  The product is just okay.  It does not toast evenly or quickly.  I wouldn't buy this product again.\n ", "\n  Like the brand\n \n  Nice toaster. Works well with a lot of available options I will probably never use. Mainly purchased because of its design and match to new appliances I bought for my kitchen, but as a toaster, it is great, and better than any Oster toasters that I have seen in Target and other stores, and cheaper as well.\n \n  disappointed, one side is toasted, the other side is burnt.  When I turned it down, the burnt side is now toasted but other side is lightly toasted\n \n  first time pushed handle down it broke of!!  Do Not Recommend\n \n  Awesome toaster.I toasts everything beautifully from bagels to waffles to toaster strudel to toast.An added bonus purple is my favorite color & it is a beautiful purple.I love this toaster. The transaction was prompt & smooth.\n \n  I like it, good value for the price\n \n  The color is a little on the wild side but I kinda like the whimsical addition to our kitchen.  Unlike nthe toaster we replaced, this one toasts dependably with little variation from the first to the last pieces of bread.\n \n  Had the same unit for years before it simply wore out.  New one exactly as advertised\n \n  Works good but seems like the inside elements don't heat up all the way.\n \n  Appears to be hotter on one side than the other for bread/bagels in both slots of the toaster.  Will probably return.\n ", "\n  Nothing\n \n  Mother in law love color and works great too\n \n  I love the design and color of this toaster. The bad news  is it does not toast well. The outside is very pale while the inside gets very dark. I will probably exchange it, hoping I just got a bad one .\n \n  Great even toasting toaster. Solid toaster esp for the money.\n \n  Nice\n \n  Hate having to flip my bread for even toasting!\n \n  Love this toaster, settings are perfect lots of options. This is a great product. Would recommend for anyone in the market for a toaster.\n \n  Wanted to like this.  Stylish design, but toaster got soo hot to the touch, especially near the top where the sides slant in.\n \n  Very pleased love the color\n \n  And the color is lovely. But the slots are not quite tall enough.\n ", "\n  Used multiple time each summer day for breakfast and snacks.  Works very well and met all expectations.\n \n  I bought this to replace 20+ year old toaster that finally started burning everything. I thought it may start a fire! I feel all grown up with my fancy toaster. Even mother-in-law was impressed with how nicely it matches my black appliances and all the neat settings.\n \n  meets my needs.\n \n  Love the design\n \n  Toasts my toast just fine.  What more can i ask?  Well it is also easy to clean, looks as good as a toaster can look, and it's easy to adjust for browness.\n \n  It is limited to the size of bread slices (normal size) if you want to toast something large like Arnold's 12 Grain, you have to do it with the bread placed upright and then reverse to do the other side.\n \n  The line to see where to dial the number to can\u2019t be seen. Needs to be painted or something. Good toaster but can\u2019t adjust easily.\n \n  I absolutely love it.  Beautiful & works perfect.\n \n  I went with the name\n \n  Great little toaster !\n ", "\n  This toaster is attractive but not all that functional unless you're toasting very small bread. The bread won't go all the way to the bottom of the heating element, leaving untoasted bread at the top.\n \n  Works great love the frozen setting\n \n  Enthusiastic toaster!!!!  The toast literally flies out of the toaster onto the plate, counter top or floor.  If only one could teach it to butter the toast on it's way out, it would then be perfect!!!!

Worst toaster I\u2019ve ever had in 70 years.  You shouldn\u2019t carry a toaster like this.

Have used it about 40 times so far, and no problems! AND YES IT'S PURPLE!\n \n  Beautiful purple ,  all toasters are the same\n \n  If I could give 10 stars, I would.  I have lived a lifetime with lousy toasters.  This one actually works and it's purple!!!!  Settings are great, size of slots is perfect.  No more burning my fingers because I can lift up the toast a bit to take it out.  Can't say enough good things.  And the price was so right!!!\n \n  It gets used regularly and I have had no problems.  Everything works as it should.\n \n  Not very happy with the way this toaster works.  Very uneven in the way it toasts.........sometimes too dark and sometimes too light on the same setting.  You never know what you are going to get.  Plus the slots aren't wide enough for some bagels.  You have to press them down before you put them in.  Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\n \n  this toaster was perfect for a couple months, but is not working anymore after 9 months\n \n  It is a good toaster marked down because the cord is short.

Works great . Perfect toast every time . Great price .\n \n  Love my purple toaster! It has a more shiny finish than matte, as it appears in the pictures. Works great! Great price! Compact enough to store in my small cupboard. Just what I wanted.\n \n  Toaster works well.  Simple to use like a toaster should be.  Cord is very short; even for a toaster.\n \n  I bought an Oster two slice toaster for making toast and frozen waffles, etc. The slots where the items are placed for baking are not deep enough to toast the top of a frozen waffle. I had to rotate the waffle to toast the top of it.\n \n  I thought this toaster worked alright.  Wasn't super consistent or even but good enough to prevent me from returning.  Then after 18 months it stopped working altogether.  Very disappointing especially after all of the great reviews.\n \n  Great inexpensive toaster, does a very good job with toast, bagels, English muffins. The setting for frozen bread works great!\n \n  Should not have bought cheap it messes with my outlets in the kitchen and every other appliance is fine. Time to spend more money\n \n  We replace our old oster toaster, let see if this one lasts 8 years at least like the old one.\n \n  Good work\n ", "\n  It works quite well.\n \n  Pretty good toaster overall, seems high quality and easy to use and clean. Only complaints are that it doesn't toast evenly (top gets more burnt) and it makes a high pitched hum when on.\n \n  Awful, this is the worst toaster I've ever owned. Don't waste your money. It doesn't toast evenly and the inside metal piece to hold the toast broke after one month.\n \n  Browns evenly.  Good value.\n \n  A pleasure to use, easy, dependable, consistent. You\u2019ll enjoy it.\n \n  So far, so good....\n \n  It takes a little while for 2 pieces to cook, but otherwise it is good.\n \n  I love this toaster.  it is a beautiful, very shiny, purple.  It has a lot of features including automatically adjusting slots, a frozen food option, a bagel option (will not hold very large bagels) and it makes excellent toast.  I find it much more useful than the toaster oven that I had before.  Sometimes the old way is the best way!\n \n  Had an Oster previously (purchased at Target), which lasted two or three years, about as much as I expect from a cheap toaster for the past couple of decades, so I figured this was a safe enough purchase. Anyway, this one is very touchy, started giving my family (I don't actually use it much) trouble after the first week. You have to empty the tray frequently or the lever won't stay down. Even then it still has trouble some times. In the dark mornings and evenings it's not easy to tell where the nob is pointed to. A couple of times it has not toasted very well at all. So, while I have not returned this one (mainly because I broke down the box after the first day when I hooked up and it seemed to be working just fine), I would not purchase again. Next time I will try another brand. \n  Very easy to use, small enough that it does not take up hardly any room on my counter and it toasts exactly as it says. I have never been disappointed with Oster.\n ", "\n  Great toasted. Every setting has a purpose...making perfect toast.\n \n  Toasts quickly! And evenly. We have a toaster oven and it's nice but it takes a looooong time to toast.  Slide out tray to remove crumbs.\n \n  Disappointing! I just toasted the first piece of bread....and one side was almost untoasted. The elements on one side (both slots) are not functioning fully; half the wires do not get hot. Based on reviews of other toasters this apparently is 'par for the course' today. You'd think that something so basic and common would have developed into a reliable product. Not here in the USA, apparently.\n \n  Well, what previous reviewers have said is true: a top portion of your bagel/bread/whatever remains untoasted. But it's a pretty small portion. I still enjoyed my bagel. And I just love the purple!\n \n  It works.

I don't believe it would hold up for long if used daily.\n \n  Efficient, quickly toasts, easy to set. Takes only a small space on crowded kitchen counters. Like this much better than a warming oven. Why? Because it takes less space and does not need monitoring for desired timing.\n \n  Love it!!!\n \n  I own this toaster.  Unless you use bread that is not very tall, it will completely skip the top part of the bread.  In my case the top 3/4 of an inch of the bread.

Would recommend.\n \n  This toaster has burn more bread than any toaster I have ever used.  Buy a different toaster.\n \n  Great toaster.\n \n  The first couple of times toasting it was stinking.

Very happy with my purchase!\n \n  Works\n \n  love it tried it for the first time today and it toasts wonderful\n \n  I think this works great. Nice even toasting...much better than a toaster oven. I like the defrost function on it as my kids like to eat frozen waffles in the morning. With the toaster oven, the inside was still cold while the outside was already toasted. Not so with the Oster. I do see what the folks who use tall sliced bread are complaining about, but it's not a problem for me because we use standard sized loaves of bread, frozen waffles,and bagels. The first couple of time you use it, it doesn't smell so great...there's a chemical or plastic like smell. My daughter ran out of the kitchen. It's not happening anymore on day 3 of use though.\n \n  This toaster is fine, probably about as good as any other in its price range, but it does not live up to the Sweethome's praise.  Toast is uneven, with the inner sides always a bit darker than the outsides.\n \n  This toaster is attractive and easy to use.\n \n  This toaster is absolutely amazing!! I saw the stainless steel one at target but I can't stand to see finger prints all over stuff. So I had to order the grey and it's perfect. The slots are big enough for bagels and the best part.... It has a warm setting!!! So I can warm up my bread for sandwiches and you may think you won't use it but you will and you'll fall in love. Also, the price is great for it.

That means it not only bakes, broil, and toasts, it also lets you air-fry right inside the oven.\n\n"}, "Reviews": ["\n  I had reservations about buying this unit because of the venomous 1-star reviews. After using this unit for a few weeks I have to assume that there were either a large number of defective products sent out (quite unusual for Cuisinart), or that some people have unrealistic expectations of a toaster oven/air fryer. \n  We have enjoyed this oven, before it broke it was used 4 times a week or more. IT is very quick to cook some foods and others are impossible to cook as it is so hot it will burn before it finishes cooking. It took a while to figure out what and what you could not cook in it. But after that it was pretty great. You can't leave it alone as it will go from just right to burnt in a matter of seconds, which ended up saving us from having a fire. The door switch failed while we were heating up mozzarella sticks to go with dinner and the oven was turning on and off randomly. I noticed it was turning on and off, walked over and opened the door. It did not shut off like normal when I opened it and you could smell plastic melting, cooking time was around 5 minutes (no cheese sticks that night) and the oven was unplugged.  This is a GFCI 15 amp protected circuit and that outlet is working fine, it never tripped the breaker. The door switch button is stuck in the closed position but is not really closed. My theory is the switch failed and it was arcing in the outlet enough to melt not only the plug and outlet but also the neutral wire going to the outlet.  Super lucky we were having dinner at the breakfast bar and not the table.  So we love it, then it tried to burn the house down. Which is why its got two stars. I plan on putting in a new switch and cord and testing it for safety. Yes I like it enough to forgive it like some  match playing child and give it a second chance to burn the house down.\n \n  There's a lot to like about this unit: as an air fryer, it has the largest surface area I found, larger than the biggest Phillips or GoWise units (and surface area, rather than volume, is what really matters).  It makes some delicious food and ticks some excellent boxes.  Unlike the GoWise air fryer I had started with, but returned because the coating on the pan was coming off after only 3 uses, these trays are more durable.  I debated whether to give it 2 or 3 stars, and overall I am keeping it so I gave it 3.  But there are some pretty serious drawbacks. \n  I purchased this oven at the end of January 2018.... now just over 1 month the oven timer knob (which is plastic) has broken. This is the knob you use all the time to turn the oven on/off.  I'm having no luck in finding a replacement knob.... \n  I never leave reviews. I'm been a huge proponent of the convection toaster oven for a long time but just got my first air fryer. Game changer. Just had my first air fried meal, and it was unbelievably crispy and very quickly cooked. I'm 23/25th through a bottle of wine right now, but I can assure you, the crsipiness was in fact the jam everyone here says it is.  It is smaller than the dimensions listed, which is a plus. Highly recommend the wine and the fryer! #godblessautocorrect\n \n  UPDATE 10/4/19 \n  It does not matter what cook setting or what temperature you set it, it only goes very hot and burns everything.  It\u2019s off by over 100 degrees.  Very poor quality from cuisinart!\n \n  I\u2019ve had this oven for over a month now. Wanted to replace an older smaller oven. This one is a lot bigger and has a lot of features, but it burns everything. I\u2019ve tried lowering the temp as it says by 25 degrees when using convection, but it still burns. I\u2019ve decreased the time and the temp even further than what they ask. The tops of stuff (I put a picture up of sweet potato fries for an example) looks fine but the stuff on the sheet burn all the time. I\u2019ve tried different positions for the sheet and still no luck. I\u2019m guessing this has a bad conversion rate for temperatures. Meaning if something has to be cooked at 425 for 10 minutes, you might be ok if you cook it at 375 for 7 minutes. It\u2019s all a guess and it shouldn\u2019t be. Not happy with this product but I doubt Cuisinart would care.\n \n  I am writing this review mainly to give distinct measurements for those like me who found at least six different measurements on the Internet. \n  This thing burns everything. The bake setting still has the convection working on very low. Cant stop it from running. Pizza burns in 10  min. Air fryer burns the fries. The oven heat control temp. setting is way off as much as 50 degrees. Looks great but is useless. My $30 toaster oven that I had worked 100% better. Save your money and steer clear of the over priced oven. The so called non stick pan it comes with is not! Cant even clean it from the burnt food deposits on it. JUNK\n ", "\n  The first one I got was dead on arrival. But the second one works perfect, I've been using it for the past few weeks and I'm very pleased. I borrowed an air fryer (not this model) to try out and had to get one. This model has everything. It's a toaster, oven, broiler, convection oven and my favorite feature an air fryer. It works great, looks good. The book has recipes. It will take a few tries to learn how to use all it's functions with various foods. I make air fryed chicken in it, take a picture and show my co-workers at work lol. I'm very pleased with it and I would recommend it. My first usage was toasting an English muffin with a dab of honey and had a big grin afterwards. Buy it, you won't regret it. \n  on/off knob broke (cheap plastic)  contacted cuisinart they do not sell the knobs.... \n  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this oven does run \u2018hot\u2019. This is my first air fryer and I\u2019m over the moon about its abilities!  The crispiness far exceeded my expectations. I\u2019m including a picture of air fried tofu sticks. I can tell you this much, I will never be without an air fryer again!\n \n  I have had this oven for more than a month and it performs very well in all functions. Air frying is easy and it cuts the cooking time almost in half for pork chops, burgers, steaks and fish fillets. After you have conquered the learning curve, your results will be more than satisfactory . \n  Worst purchase and waste of money.  Went in dumpster tonight.  I had a basic toaster oven for 10 years but thought I needed a new one.  This one smoked up my apt and needed to be thoroughly cleaned after each use. If I didn\u2019t clean it the kitchen smelled.  And even using tin foil on pan, the pan turned black after a couple of uses. When I moved it to clean on outside there were oil drippings on counter. I should get my money back on this one!  This was throwing money out the window. I went to Target and bought a basic model.\n \n  I bought this oven in December of 2017. I was never able to turn it off manually by turning the timer knob (as you would expect) and always had to let the timer run out. The last time I tried to turn the knob to lessen the time, it melted inside and fell apart. I started using pliers to turn it on. Next I noticed that the plug into the wall outlet was burning hot - hot enough that I had to use a dishtowel to unplug it. I'm frustrated, as I get no response from seller and I am definitely afraid to use it. \n  Before I bought this product, I read all the reviews. Based on that, I bought it and read the instructions carefully because it seems to me that the people with the bad reviews did not read them. Product arrived in perfect condition, and works great, as advertised. I love this oven! I have not found anything that I can complain about after using it daily since we've had it.\n \n  I have only had this for 2-1/2 weeks and have already had a problem with the timer knob falling off. The instructions say to turn the knob to the left to turn the unit off, but it doesn't turn off , the knobs break and just fall off the stem. Other than that, this is a very powerful oven and you need to watch what you are cooking, or it will get over cooked quickly. If the problem is resolved, I would give this a 5 star review.. \n  This product had great usage for the first 4 months they all of a sudden it stopped working just like the video another Amazon shoppers posted the timer works but they oven/fryer doesn\u2019t work unless I open the oven/fryer door. The oven/fryer is very large but it does have a lot of features, I buy a lot of cusinart products and this is the first that failed me so quickly hopefully the customer service will make it right.\n \n  I'm having a terrible time. I have cooked three times, three different things, three different time and temperature settings. Each time the food was burned on the outside and cool (or warm) on the inside. I cannot cook for the required time at any temperature. A cook time of 30 min. at 350 degree was burning at ten minutes time. Similar results for other attempts such as baked potatoes and pancakes. Burnt!! I believe the temperature is off by a considerable amount and I'm buying an oven thermometer to check it out.\n ", "\n  So far I\u2019ve just made wings but they are perfection!  Crispy all over and so good!  I have only needed about 1/2 cup oil to do about 10 pounds of wings, too.\n \n  Everything I've cooked in here is burnt on the outside and frozen in the center. I've played with the different settings, times and temperatures and still have the same issues.\n \n  Where do I begin? I really hoped to replace my Cuisinart oven with one that would also air fry but the drawbacks exceeded the benefits.  I had the TOB-260 Cuisinart Oven and was very pleased with almost everything about it but wanted the air fry option so I elected to try the new TOA-60. \n  (  See my photos of my Air Fry successes )))  steak, pizza rolls, Pork chops and Turkey Breast \n  I wanted an air fryer but knew if it didn't live on the counter, I'd rarely use it.  This combination convection toaster oven/air fryer was a good option, and I'm very glad I purchased it.  I have successfully cooked a baked potato, mini-cornbread muffins, air fried home-breaded chicken fillets, home-breaded onion rings (YUM), frozen French fries, and toasted plain and cheese toast.  I had a few other recipes that were epic fails, but it was a poor recipe.  this versatile appliance has endless possibilities to help you be a creative cook.  In the beginning, watch the food carefully, as it cooks much faster than most recommended cooking time for items cooked in toaster ovens.  Cuisinart almost got it Perfect. \n  I went back and forth about buying this because of the reviews. I am so glad I bought it. The air fry portion is wonderful to have. Times listed for items seem pretty accurate. I don't just set the timer and walk away tho. Sometimes it needs adjustment. Nothing has burned or not worked yet. \n  After reading many reviews,decided t go ahead. So far it is working well. Had one instance of overcooking due to not remembering that foods will cook faster due to convection factor.Sticking was mentioned by others and difficult clean up.I remembered the importance of 'seasoning the cookware.\" I did this and also reminded my dishwasher husband not to use anything to scratch the cooking surface as that will produce sticking food next time around. \n  This is a pretty good air fryer all things considered. I haven't really used the toasting or broiling functions but those are par for the course I guess. \n  The oven gets very hot and all the knobs are plastic. Mine has melted and now can turn the power on because the knob us no longer on the toaster oven. Tried to get replacement and the manufacturer doesn't want to help.\n \n  I bought this to replace a smaller Cuisinart which did not have the air fry capability. So it is better than the old in those respects. But it is decidedly inferior to it in a few others: ", "\n  I purchased this because I found my Phillips air fryer wasn't big enough when the family came over.  The Phillips did an amazing job but it was hard to clean - too big to always put in the dishwasher - and it was noisy.  This one is easy to clean - very quiet and the only parts to go in the dishwasher are the basket and tray. \n  I don\u2019t know where to start. We bought this to replace a toaster oven. This is a larger toaster oven but is much smaller inside. I assume that extra space was used for the controls. The problem I see is the heating elements are directly exposed to anything you are cooking. It is a lot like you are broiling everything rather than baking or air frying. We initially had a cheap air fryer and were excited to get this one as it was much more expensive. Problem is the cheap one does a much better job. Anything put in this one comes out burnt because it is essentially broiling your food not using hot air. I\u2019m sure it is circulating air, but with the heating element exposed to the food it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve had it for 3 months now so no return for me.\n \n  I had an old toaster oven that needed replacing and got this because of the additional air fryer function, and I love it! The toast function turns out the best bagels I\u2019ve had and I\u2019ve had so much fun making my own tortilla chips with the air fryer function. I\u2019m still playing around with different things to use it with but so far everything has come out great! \n  This product is not worth what I paid at $160 and certainly isn't worth $198 what it's selling for now. The broiler on mine doesn't work and upon reflection, I don't think it has worked since day one. Therefore, it doesn't toast evenly, I have to flip it half way through. I just got them to send me another one as a replacement, but I have to pay return shipping and also $10 extra for nothing. I haven't even checked on the shipping charges yet, but I'm sure it will be a lot, like $50 or $70. Furthermore, they sent the replacement in this huge box instead of the original box so now I'm going to have to find a reasonable sized box to send it back in. I suspect they sent me a refurbished one instead of a new one. Even if the broil had worked on this oven I wouldn't have recommended it. It blows so much hot air out of the back of the oven when it is on air fry. You can actually look through the slats on the back right into the oven and all that hot air just comes straight out into your kitchen. I have mine set at the end if a counter facing outward instead of towards the wall because I fear the hot air will melt the glue on my backsplash and possibly damage the underside of my cupboards. I have always had a toaster oven for small backing and toasting, but this one is not any better than any other toaster oven IMO. I don't really use the air fry function as it cooks the outside before cooking the inside. I do sort of like the air bake function. It works quickly and cooks things pretty well. Anyway, the worst thing is that if something goes wrong with your oven you will be charged shipping and the extra $10 to get the old one back to them. I will shop at my local Costco from now on where I can return things for two years and not pay shipping. Don't buy it.\n \n  Our last Cuisinart toaster oven lasted way over twelve years without missing a beat.  When we purchased this machine we gave the old oven to a good friend who loves it. \n  I am a recent convert to air frying.  Food tastes great and is far more healthy.  I started with the Philips and loved the convenience (speed) and the quality of the end product, especially chicken breast.  However, the basket was so small that making 6 or 8 breasts took too long.  So I researched the XL Philips and looked at the Cuisinart Toaster Oven/Air Fryer combination.  I decided to try the Cuisinart as it was only slightly larger than a toaster (generally in height) and leaving it on the counter would be easier.  So very glad I did.  The quality of the air fried food is just as good as the Philips AND it is far less noisy.  Cleanup time is about the same, although the basket screen in the Philips seems to be a bit easier as less sticks to the surface.  Toaster works great - had a Breville and this one works as well.  I like the oven light - very helpful feature and this appliance is equal in size to the XXL Philips but was about $100 less.  I highly recommend this product as I am picky and going forward I would not want to be without this appliance.\n \n  Recieved today but sending back. Set at 300 goes to 450. Incinerated outside of the air fries  in 9 minutes wnen book said 20 min. Raw inside.  Temperature control way off. Although 1 bar on bottom never heats  It  managed to burn top of muffins while still totally raw inside.  The 3.8 lb roast chicken was incinerated on top but raw on bottom with temp set at only C350 bottom rack. It's fan is powerful but quiet & it's handsom on the countertop. Weighs 3 times what my old countertop oven did  so i expected a great machine but it's such a disappointment. If it worked id love it.  I would have asked for an exchange but I see others have had this overheat problem so i guess it's  a got a number of built in common quirks.jafter chasing ups man all day to return SG Box kept $30.00 for my return despite the fact that the item did not work. Im giving minus rating. Update i ordered another front another supplier & temp problems the same... set at 300, did preheat, temp moves between 200 & 375.  350 goes between 275 & 450. Can't outfox it or learn dif dial set  because of the wide swing.  I hate the hassel of sending it back...again.  I wont' try a third.  I had much better results with my way cheaper  old one.\n \n  UPDATE: Oven died after just under two years. Never again. \n  I was very excited about buying this, after all, it\u2019s a Cuisinat.  First of all, it over cooks everything. I threw a lot of money away on incredible food.  Most unfortunate.  I have many friends that have purchased different brands of air fryers and they love them.  It certainly could be user error on my part.  However, I purchased this several months ago and after several attempts of modifying temps and cook time, it has been an epic fail.  Cooking should not be this difficult or expensive, especially if you are a good traditional cook. \n  I would rate this Cuisinart Airfryer Toaster with ZERO stars, as it only lasted for 8 months before it started shorting out on all cook settings.  I would give one star for ease of cleaning and attractiveness of the toaster, but looks are very deceiving!  When it did work, it cooked way too hot and food was charred.  Purchased the extra Asurion warranty insurance, but they would not honor it, because toaster still covered under Cuisinart's 3 year original \"warranty\", which entails my paying shipping for a new unit, and my paying to ship old unit back to them, which was very costly, as toaster weighs 30 pounds.  Not worth the money and Cuisinart does NOT stand behind their products. Poor quality, poor warranty guarantee, poor customer service, as I had to call 3 separate times until they shipped me a new unit.  Very disappointed!\n ", "\n  I was so excited to get this oven! It does everything and more, and I think it's gorgeous. I've had a Cuisinart toaster oven for years, and when my last one was broken by our housecleaners, I researched the heck out of ovens. Initially I purchased the Cuisinart TOB-35N, but that one is digital and was so confusing I sent it back. I couldn't even figure out the timer, and I'm no tech dummy. So, this one being analog, I thought it would be perfect. It was. Except, it didn't cook at temperature! It burned everything. I tried adjusting time, temp to figure out the oven's idiosyncrasies, but finally gave up after burning 2 batches of cookies!! I called Cuisinart, and they told me this model is notorious for being uncalibrated and to send it back. It was literally 50 to 75 degrees off, by my estimation. I'm crushed, I really loved all the functions (though I can't figure out the difference between air fry and convection). So, after 3 tries, I switched to an Oster. Just arrived today.... fingers crossed. \n  This is the worst purchase I've made through amazon. (and I've bought a lot of items over the past few years). I thought it would be what it was billed to be, but after a few weeks, the timer went out.  I thought I might have problems with it when I pulled if from the box and the sheet metal seemed so flimsy. Of course I don't have the box to return it now. That is my problem for trusting this to be a good product based on some of the reviews.  I should have saved the box to return it. Now I have a huge toaster that has to be constantly watched over so whatever is inside does not burn. Caution! don't get burned. \n  Overall nice quality, easy/simple to use, timer works well. \n  It says right on the box \"extra large capacity\". It is not. I could not believe how small it was inside. Once I put the tray in there, I am not sure I could fix anything more than a grilled cheese sandwich in it.9878\n \n  I've had mine for about a month now. In the past, I've had toaster ovens and they are great for cooking for a single person. I've never used and air fryer before and overall, I like this products, but there are a couple drawbacks. #1 - timing isnt precise but that's easy to fix with the timer on my stove or microwave. #2 - runs hot. I've burnt just about everything I've tried to cook in the oven and air fryer. I love baked salmon and I cook it to the suggested internal temp, but that means the outside is pretty charred. I may try it without the cooking spray and cook for longer at a lower temp. # 3 - easier to clean than my regular over but the heating elements still get in the way. I just swipe it down with my dawn dishwand and wipe it out with paper towel. #4 - burned drip tray. A previous poster had the same problem. I scrubbed and scrubbed with dawn, with vinegar and baking soda and nothing.  I covered it with foil for future use but still a disappointment. Overall, I like this product and will continue to use it. Potential buyers should be aware of its quirks prior to purchase \n  I can't begin to say how much I love this machine! I use the air fryer the most and am able to cook things without a microwave on little to no time. \n  I am not keeping this airfryer, but wanted to give my thoughts on it and some general tips on air frying. I have owned several airfryers over the past 3 years.  I've learned what times and temps work for the foods I cook. My food never burns and it didn't with this particular product. Do not use the cooking instructions on food packages when air frying. I typically airfry frozen french fries on 400 for about 7 mins. Or, until they are as crisp as I want. Always stay nearby and check your food from time to time. Maybe every 5 mins or so. This is not a Set it and Forget it type of appliance. When I make fried chicken, I preheat at 360 for a few mins. It helps the breading stay on. I would not use the airfryer to cook a frozen pizza. Just use the oven/bake function. I would not use it to make homemade pizza, as the toppings...especially cheese are going to fly around. Again, use the bake function for this. Do not overcrowd the food when air frying. You can't put an entire bag of french fries in at one time. \n  While I love the Cuisinart brand, this toaster oven is so badly engineered that it is cumbersome to use.  There is no catch plate on the bottom to clean.  The trays need to be juggled to use.  There are so many better models on the market.  I'm so sorry that I didn't do due diligence on this item.  Cumbersome and badly designed.\n \n  Let me first address the one bad review here: \n  I was excited to get this oven for the air frying capability, but as soon as we started cooking with it, we noticed things would burn very easily.  As many reviewers have noted, the timer knob is very vague and there is not clear markers for 0-10 minutes.  No problem you may think, if I need 5 minutes to warm something up, turn it half way between the two mark.  Issue is that there is a decent amount of play in the knob, so it's hard to tell 2 minutes from 8.  Aside from the timing issue, I suspected that everything was significantly hotter than the knob indicated.  I placed an over timer in the unit and monitored a few different temperatures; when setting to 300 degrees, my unit operated between 325 and 360.  When set to 400 degrees, my unit fluctuated between 440 and 500...no wonder things were burning! ", "\n  What a wonderful kitchen addition this is!  We were looking at air fryers, but don't have much counter space, so were delighted when we found this combination toaster/convection oven, and air fryer.  It is easy to operate, easy to clean and keep clean.  And, best of all, works great.  We love having our French fries again, without the guilt of all that excess oil.  We have tried 3 kinds of frozen fries, plus fresh fries, and they have all cooked up deliciously........crunchy and crispy, soft inside.  We have also air fried steaks, pork chops, and brots, and they have all cooked up deliciously.  My husband even thinks we could get rid of our stove with this nice oven and fryer.  (I don't of course).  But, it will sure lead to less use of our stove, less mess.  I have lined the drip pan with foil, and with just a little effort most things wipe clean, or I can just replace with new foil.  We loved this because it replaced our well worn and used toaster oven on our countertop, and we didn't have to find a place to stash an extra air fryer.  It's all right there handy!  I highly recommend.  The only possible critique I could make is the timer...........it's hard to know exactly how long the timer is set for.  I have taken to using my usual kitchen timer as well, works great.  This does not change my  mind about this great addition to our kitchen.  I have found that the times on  many recipes have to be shortened, as this oven and fryer seems to be pretty hot.  Also, we have had no issue with it heating the surrounding area so much that we are worried about damage.\n \n  I made myself wait a month before I wrote this because I knew I would have to get used to this new appliance.  I was right.  It would not have been a fair review before. \n  I really love this appliance.  I do however wish the built in timer worked.  It turns the unit on but it doesn't run the selected time I've set down to zero then set off the \"done\" alarm.  It's just an on switch right now.  Lame.  I expected more from Cuisinart.  Quality control has slipped to the wayside.  For the money, I still like this unit but the timer is kind of a big deal.  First time I used it I burned the heck out of the wings I was air frying.  Yes, the timer never went off after 20 minutes and I was busy around the house.  Finally when it dawned on me too much time had passed and I hadn't heard the timer go off I went to check on it and there it still sat on 20 minutes.  I turned it to the off position manually and the timer beeper went off only then.  Like I said, lame.\n \n  I love the air fryer feature!  However, air frying often means cooking something with fatty skin (like wings), or with a small amount of oil...like roasted vegetables.  This splatters the inside of the oven and it is nearly impossible to clean adequately. There are three heating rods across the top and bottom of the unit.  They do not remove and there is not enough room to slide fingers and a rag between them and the roof of the unit.  Hence, the oil continues to bake on harder with each use.  The inner parts are not dishwasher safe, and I knew this prior to purchasing.  However, they are also not able to be cleaned with much other than a cloth (no scrubbers) or they scratch.  \ud83d\ude44 I have had my appliance for a couple months and it was looking pretty bad after just a few uses.  Also, a 4 lb whole chicken does NOT fit in the oven without hitting against top elements.  Overall, I am disappointed mostly due to the \u201ccleanability\u201d issue.  I find myself using it less than I would like for this reason.  Also takes up a lot of real estate.\n \n  My husband and I loved this product, until it died last night. Not even a year old.  No idea why product stopped working. And now imaging I can\u2019t return it. \ud83d\ude15  I will replace this item with another, probably not this same one. This inside top surface gets splattered while cooking, wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to throughly clean it. \n  I really wanted to like this toaster oven. It was supposed to upgrade my old Cuisinart. My old toaster oven had \"exact heat\" and it worked very similar to my big kitchen oven. This new TOA-60 is WAY hotter. I try to lower the temperature but then I can't figure out when something is done. I've burned several items, which never burned in my old toaster oven. Thank goodness my old (smaller) toaster oven still works. I still use the old one and only use this new one for air-frying.  I wish it had more slots to adjusted the height of the shelf. It seems to be either too low or too high. Really frustrated with this purchase.\n \n  Ordered my first and found the temperature settings (and timer) not accurate.  Unit ran too hot.  Called cuisinart and they claimed they were not aware of such problems, even though you find this issue on many reviews.  So sent it back to amazon and ordered another.  Well got the 2nd one and it was no better than the first.  Put a oven thermometer in it and tested on many different setting.  Result;  Temperature was all over the place.  On average it ran 50 to 75 degrees too hot!  Tried to factor that in to cooking.  50 - 65 degrees LESS than recipes called for baking; 65 to 80 degrees less for convection cooking, and 80 to 110 degrees for air frying.  Close, but always a hit or miss.  Finally we got tired of trying to guess and factor for the units very inaccurate and very verable temp control.  Sent the second unit back!  Spent  more money on the Breville toaster oven air, and WOW what a difference and great machine!!!\n \n  The first one I bought I had for 3 months before I decided to try a pizza.  Was supposed to take around 20 minutes to bake.  After 10 minutes the pizza was black.  I inserted my electronic temperature probe to see what was going on.  I had set the temp at 400, but it was well over 500 degrees inside the oven.  I let it cool and tried it again, at 300 and 350.  The temp would swing 160 degrees, between 260 and 420 when set at 300.  I ordered another oven thinking it was broke and it has a 160 degree swing too.  So, this is not a problem with the unit, but a design issue that Cuisinart obviously knows about.  If you plan on doing anything in the oven that requires a somewhat stable temperature you will be sadly disappointed in this unit.  Too bad, its a decent unit other than the temp issue.  Very surprised that Cuisinart would knowingly sell a product with such a major operational flaw. \n  I wanted to buy an air fryer years ago but didn\u2019t want another appliance on the counter. Having a combo like this has been perfect! The oven doesn\u2019t get too hot on the outside (like the Kitchenaid- I returned). I love that it has knobs and isn\u2019t digital. Have only had it a couple of months, but very happy with it so far.\n \n  Over the years we have purchased a number of different toaster ovens and the like.  This one was a real surprise. The air fry setting is amazing. We can cook six or seven strips of bacon in 10 minutes.  In 10 minutes the bacon is evenly cooked, crispy without having to do anything except put the bacon in the oven and take them out when they\u2019re done. It also does excellent job on french fries, tater tots, fish sticks and baked potatoes. ", "\n  I purchased this item and absolutely loved it. Used it everyday. It toasts all my food perfectly, can make fried items taste like they are fried, but healthy. After 19 months, it started acting funny, the door would open and the safety switch quit working, then the heating element eventually went out of it. I contacted cuisinart and without a serial number they will not help me with the 3 year warranty. I called twice and they referred me to email. I tried that and they just ignore me. So I'm out the money of this toaster over and I ended up getting a cheaper one used and it works just as good. BEWARE cuisinart doesn't honor the warrany, even though I had the proof of purchase from amazon.com. Really makes me think twice about purchasing cuisinart appliances in the future for sure!\n \n  I debated about getting a toaster oven/air fryer for over a year because I read conflicting reviews about how well they actually worked.  Well, this thing is the bomb!  I have used it for oven-fry recipes and for frozen foods that could be either baked or deep fried.  For both types of food, everything comes out crispy crunchy and takes a lot less time to cook than than when I put it in the regular oven.  It also reheats food quickly and makes the most perfect toasted bagels I have ever seen.  I have had mine for several months now, and I love it!  I am also looking forward to using it this summer as an alternative to heating up the kitchen with the regular oven.  It's large (and yet doesn't take up that much more room than a regular toaster over).  It works beautifully.  I highly recommend it!\n \n  WoW!!! From purchasing October 1st 2018...to taking up space in the landfill by March 1st 2020! The Cuisinart name is evidently no longer associated with being a quality product! What a complete waste of money! When it worked it was amazing to have an air fryer, oven, toaster, etc., all in one product...then without warning it just quit working. My guess is that it got too hot in the upper heating element area and melted some wiring.\n \n  This air fryer/toaster oven was everything I was looking for: a (what I perceived to be) quality kitchen appliance from a brand I trusted that would allow me to replace both my fryer and my toaster oven. Unfortunately, and I've had it for about 6-8 months now, I have been very disappointed. The worst thing is that the oven burns EVERYTHING. I'm talking I have things set to the lowest possible temperature setting (somewhere between 200-300 degrees), the oven set to warm even when I'm trying to bake something, and I never set the timer for more than 10 minutes, and things still come out burnt, if not on top, then completely black on the bottom. There are several other reviews that talk about buying your own timer or \"calibrating\" the temperature dial, but the simple fact is that this air fryer/toaster oven runs way too hot and has basically become a black hole on my counter. I never want to use it because I usually don't have duplicate and triplicate amounts of food to replace meals that come out burnt. Just tonight, I made a mini DiGiorno pizza, and within probably 2-3 minutes, the pepperonis were curled and crispy, the cheese was already looking black, and the crust was completely raw. I ended up eating it that way because undercooked, stretchy crust was better than throwing the entire thing away and having to come up with another plan for dinner. \n  I normally like Cuisinart products, but I have to agree with others,  this product is VERY defective. \n  This was delivered on August 27, 2019. The toaster oven worked fine for first 3 weeks. Used the air fryer once in that time, and it worked fine, too.  Tried air frying again about a week later and the convection fan will not work, so i cannot air fry or convection bake or broil. Return window had just closed, so I contacted the manufacturer and was told they would send a new replacement. That was over 2 weeks ago and I have yet to receive it. I will update this review if the replacement is received, but at this point I'm highly disappointed and would not recommend. \n  Had this now for exactly two months to the day.  Everything about this appliance screams 5 stars: ease of use; build quality; versatility; how the convection oven cycle makes THE BEST baked yams (orange sweet potatoes) on the planet.  It only falls short on ease of cleaning: not the oven itself (inside is indeed non-stick and a breeze to clean), but the tray and wire basket.  For the first few days, I mistakenly baked the yams without sealing them inside an aluminum foil prophylactic (sorry for the choice of words) and the sugary emissions (vital to render the yam carmelized) completely ruined both accessories.  Luckily, when I pointed out this discrepancy to Amazon (the web description claims they are non-stick), Amazon sent me a replacement unit.  So, in reality, I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  Oh, the air fryer feature is 5.5 stars.  And a wonderful unseen boon?: because I haven't used my big oven more than once since Oct 8, my electricity bill is down 20%!  Yep.  Granted we live in a small seniors one bedroom, but when the biggest chunk of your monthly income is Social Security, that 20% means a paid-for movie on our Prime Masterpiece Channel every Sunday night. \n  We have had this product a few days now, it was an early Mother\u2019s Day present from my hubby. He said of course I can get it just make sure the reviews are good so we don\u2019t waste the money on a bad product. I looked for daysssss and checked every good/bad review on this item and was sure this was the one. Imagine my surprise when my order went from \u201cordered\u201d to \u201cpackage delivered\u201d and ALL the reviews changed to bad. Every bad thing people talked about, we\u2019ve experienced. The temperature is so off, if you don\u2019t sit in front of it then all your food WILL burn so not only is the temp wrong but the timer is as well! The trays are ridiculously hard to clean and if you get a scratch on any of them, GOOD LUCK!! The whole pans ruined now. It stinks while it\u2019s on, and the outside gets so hot. Hubby agreed we can wait a couple more days and see if maybe it\u2019s just us that needs to learn a technique with it but so far I am beyond mad with how this products turned out ESPECIALLY for the price I paid for it!\n \n  This oven over-cooked everything. I am an experienced cook and even use a toaster oven occasionally, so I know what they\u2019re limitations are. Even following the manufacture\u2019s suggestion of cooking items at 25degrees less (I did it even lower to see if that made a different) the tops of the food always cooked too fast. I also found that if you cooked on convection, things really scorched. Again, I turned the temp down by 25 degrees or more. I didn\u2019t try the air fry at all, because I figured food would be burnt in no time and yet still uncooked in the middle. After several attempts to adjust my cooking times and techniques and get to know the appliance, I returned it. You can\u2019t serve beautiful food with over done tops.\n \n  I could hardly wait to get this and now after trying to cook with it for a couple months I wish I could send it back. I have eaten more burnt food from this than I have in my 70+ years. I am on a limited income and can not afford to throw food away. I was so sure this was going to help me with cooking only for one. There is definitely a bigger learning curve with this than I can afford.\n ", "None None None \n  \u00a0WOW...For such a company, they really have started to produce some poor products. When you hear the name Cuisinart you think quality product.  But it seems that they really have been just trying to bang our products without a care of making it quality for the price point they charge. This TOA-60 is one such product.  We had VERY high hopes for this unit as we were looking for a new toaster oven and we also wanted a Air Fryer, so this would solve our needs and save us space seeing we live full time in a motor coach.  But what a let down. \n  This oven air fries my wings, hamburgers, chicken, etc, in a short amount of time. I hate cleaning the basket. You have to use a brush while the basket is under water. Otherwise you will never get the basket clean. Forget parchment paper with holes in them. If you use them, you will have to turn the meat over.\n \n  Air fryer feature is decent, but still not a replacement for real deep frying! Overall capacity of the oven is on the small size. I was hoping that this oven could cook a standard frozen pizza (e.g., Tombstone), but it wont fit. The quality of the knobs does not exude \"high-quality\" (plastic-y and wobby) but they are functional. The timer knob that you use to set how long things cook for is a old-school dial, so it's very difficult to set an accurate time. Stuff cooks faster than traditional toaster ovens so you do have to watch your food constantly, especially given that the timer only gives you so-so accuracy.Also, not sure why they made a design decision to include cooking trays and racks that you cant put through the dishwasher. The instructions say that you need to hand-wash. Ugh, ain't got no time for that! If I were to do it again, I would look for an oven that had bigger capacity and I would be willing to spend a bit more for higher quality look-and-feel. I previously had one of those Breville countertop ovens. It was perfect in every way EXCEPT that it stopped turning on (a well-documented problem that after many years still hasn't been fixed).\n \n  It\u2019s a brilliant idea.  I was so excited to get my Cruisinart toaster oven air fryer.  Aftervvery minimal use the timer knob on the toaster broke off.  I requested a new knob, but Conaur refused saying they needed to order a complete replacement.  Almost 3 months later I got an entirely new unit.  All good excited the old one is still here because the return UPS label doesn\u2019t work.  Today while making 2 slices of toast the glass in the door popped and shattered.  No apparent reason  No way to get a door or a new glass.  Now on here it\u2019s two broken expensive units and honestly, I don\u2019t want either of them anymore.\n \n  I read the reviews,  I \n  The matter of undercooked to burned to a crisp is a matter of a few seconds. It either burns the top or burns the bottom of what's being cooked. Wasted $200 because now I can't return. I haven't had a single thing cook right. I've followed the instructions to a T. I've pulled it away from wall. Everything. Replacing and throwing this out. Don't buy it. I should have listened to the reviews!\n \n  I mostly love my toaster oven.  Pros:  Everthing gets super crispy.  It makes the best fried tofu.  We use it for fries, tater tots, toasted ravioli (a st. Louis thing), and for heating stuff up.  It also does amazing baked chicken.  Just oil up your chicken and add seasoning.  It also holds a decent amount of food compared to other air fryers. \n  When I tried toasting bread, cooking a pot pie, and heating a pizza, all were burned by an overheating front top heating element.  I also noticed that there wasn't enough interior height to do anything except toast bread or heat pizza.  Anything thicker than about a half inch would be too close to heating elements.  As for easy to clean, I didn't need to try that, so my 1 star rating is only because N/A isn't an option.  Energy efficiency must be terrible because the exterior of the cabinet gets really HOT when it's in use.  A lot of energy wasted there.  I cannot recommend the Quisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven for anything except toasting bread or heating pizza, and that's only if you get one with no defects.  I have returned mine.\n \n  Update!! Its been 2 months. I've barely even read the instructions, I've mainly winged it. Last night I Air Fried Cauliflower!!! Usually I'd grab chips bc they are easy.... My grocery list has changed, I never liked to cook broccoli nor eat it raw... the other day, I Air Fried it with potatoes I cut up, just to see what would happen!! My kid came and grabbed what I was eating and said I needed to share after he tasted the Broccoli.  My kid I love it! It's a Game Changer!! Mybparents are Vegan I. Can't wait for them to visit so I can Air Fry some veges and meals for them. After 2 months I have made low carb no sugar sweet potato pie, pizza, veggies, a frittata, potato chips,  salmon, chicken wings and I'm not a cook really... I'm so over the moon happy I had to write an update.  With the virtual learning and all the changes the air fryer is helping me to save money and cook easy things and teach my son to cook and chose better healthier choices! That's the end of my update! Going to roast beets now, I haven't eaten them in almost a year! ..............My only concern was whether it would over power my little galley kitchen... look in the picture, it doesn't and actually there's room between it and the cabinets. I am a minimalist, I don't like stuff and things everywhere, clean nice spaces with art are my thing, well this fits perfectly, i love the design, its like a work of art, and for me, the fun of teaching my son, 11, and myself, how to use this was so easy and fun! The health benefits of being able to cook  veges like zucchini sticks!! I loooove them! I pop them in and they are done in no time, plenty enough to feed me and my family in no time... I made chicken for my omnivore son, and a vegan monk fruit sweetened sweet potato pie for me, and the list goes on and one! I loooooove it! The toaster part is an added bonus... yes there is trial and error but very little and so easy anyone over the age of 7 can use this... obviously with parental instructions b/c it is an toaster oven, air fryer etc.  I love it, I can't say enough, that's why I took a picture b/c my only hesitation was would it fit my kitchen, and it does, and its kinda got a retro/modern appeal so its a great fit for me! I'm using spices again, and eating veges and potato wedges and stuff. I'm gitty over this air fryer simply gitty!!\n \n  Love this thing. Our stand alone air fryer died so we got this one to replace that and our horrible toaster oven from the 1990s. Works so much better than the old oven and the air fryer is much bigger and works much better. Slightly harder to clean and to shake food while air frying but it does the air frying soooooo much better it is an acceptable trade off. Love the old school controls and retro look. The digital stuff is what failed on the old air fryer so I was happy to find one without it. Also the light!!! It has a light and you don\u2019t realize how important a light is in a toaster over/ air fryer until you have one. Totally recommend this is one combo unit that works very well and saves so much counter space!\n ", "\n  Normally I only look at positive reviews cause I realize you can't please everyone . I bought this product used it a few times and it was amazing ,but something went wrong very quickly it started running very hot the timer quit working and the only reason I set another timer was to see if I was correct . Thank God I did !! These cookies were placed in the oven for 10 min and luckily I had set another timer cause this could've been bad . Love the brand but this is obviously an issue that needs to be addressed asap\n \n  I wanted to get an air fryer but with a family of 5 (including 3 athletic kids who eat like horses), it just didn't seem practical to have to cook multiple batches of food.  Then I saw this on Amazon!  I had it \"saved for later\" in my cart for quiet awhile but at the beginning of the summer I decided I couldn't stand the heat of using the oven and went ahead and got it.  I'm so glad I did!  I takes a little practice to use as an oven (my first quiches were a bit burnt on the edges/bottom) but I soon learned to turn down the temp and watch things closely.  I've used for baking grain free bread (one of my kids can't have grains or legumes), personal sized pizzas, a small pan of brownies, etc.  It won't fit a full sized loaf of whole wheat bread, the bread rises up too tall. \n  Pros: Easy to clean; nice looking.  Cons:  Analog dials, not digital; temperatures no where near what the dial says...runs very hot; have to turn on timer to turn heat on; no pre-heat feature (no bell when desired temperature is reached).  Just poorly engineered.\n \n  As stated by many other reviewers, the knobs are junk. But that's not the only problem with this piece of junk, the power cord began overheating  after the first use. I'm pretty sure 18 gauge lamp cord and plug isn't really the right setup of an 1800 watt appliance. I replaced the cord with a 12 gauge cord and solved that one problem. Now, 10 months later, it will not stay running for more than 10 seconds, and the fan does not stop when the door is opened. If you do decide to buy one of these pieces of junk, buy the extended warranty, you WILL need it.\n \n  In general, I'm pleased with the oven, but find it runs much too hot, and there's no way to calibrate it. The toaster oven I had for years was a Delonghi. It baked everything far better than this one because I could count on it being the correct temperature. Also, when it came to temp, it let me know; something the Cuisinart oven doesn't do. The Delonghi had a clock - a great feature that this Cuisinart is missing. So, although I gave it a 4 star rating, it probably deserves 3.5 instead. I've only had the oven for a month or so, so can't rate durability.\n \n  I really loved this oven!  I waited for Amazon to lower it's price and it did. \n  The temperature regulation is the worst. Air fryer burns most everything. Poor temperature regulation. Food is very close to heating elements. If something needs a temp of 350\u02da set it for 250\u02da and hope it does not burn. I am very disappointed with Cuisinart TOA-60. I should had bought the Air firer on info merchantial. I wish I could re-gift it back to Cuisinart. Don't buy it. Garbage.\n \n  I bought my \u201cmagic oven\u201c last summer on Amazon prime day. Was looking for a toaster oven, had tried an air fryer the year before and sent it back. And then I saw this. \n  I have had the Cuisinart TOA-60 AirFryer Convection Toaster Oven since last Feb 2019. We love it. Fries ready in have the time of the oven and about the same time of the oil drenched ones.  I use the convection oven cycle for Marie Calendar Pot Pies (15 ounces). I use the box direction temp, poke the holes in the top, place a piece of foil over the top (not around the sides like it says), pop in the Cuisinart TOA-60 AirFryer Convection Toaster Oven on the \"bake\" function with the fan. Let it go for 45 mins, take foil off and bake until top is golden brown. The time varies a bit depending on the type of of pot pie..  It works better than the oven because it does not seem to dry the pie out. I USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE for the PRO and CON.  Bakes it great, time the same. The one con I have is baking evenness. The back of the oven bakes a little hotter, so you have to make sure you move items or stir items half way through cook time. I have to do that with my regular oven.  It is also important to PREHEAT this oven like the instructions say to. Overall rating is a 4 stars for me because I gave everything a 4 star rating except energy efficiency, which I give 3 stars. AirFryer, yes baking - not really for energy efficiency.  4 star - Cleaning, if you spritz some spray oil on it, not too bad. If you don't - UGH! I can see why some have issues with this oven and others don't. I just happen to be one of the happy customers. I am adding this as a side note: I did not read any reviews on this item, I bought it blind as I have always trusted Cuisinart name. If I had read them, I might have passed this one by. I have recommended this oven to several people and no one who actually bought one has complained to me so far.\n \n  We have had this for over two years now and love how it works. Yes things burn when set to the recommended temperature. But you can adjust accordingly (e.g. for pizza and baking vegetables, I set them both to convection baking at 350 F for 10 minutes. And I don't preheat since it heats up so quickly. I don't care that the instructions say 450 degrees for 12-15 minutes). I should point out that we never turn the timer knobs back to zero given the multiple reviews of the knobs breaking (just unplug it or keep the door open and let the timer run out). We actually don't use it as much for air frying now, mostly for convection baking. We use it multiple time a week for baking vegetables and frozen pizza. Here's a tip for getting good crispy frozen Costco pizza (or similar size) where the crust is crispy and not burnt, which I just figured out only a few weeks ago.  Use foil or baking paper (I cut the parchment paper corners so it does not get too close to the heating elements) and place on the sliding grill only. However (here's the trick) I flip the sliding grill upside down so the pizza is not as close to the bottom heating elements.  If the grill is left right side up so the bottom is closer to the bottom elements, the crust gets burnt every time. ", "\n  Use it every day. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is the timer. This is a wind up type timer that you can't be accurate or consistent with. Therefore you have to use your own timer or check through the window often. Why they didn't put a digital timer on this unit is a mystery.\n \n  I have always liked Cuisinart products, and thought I would be better off ordering a brand I knew.  Besides, it seemed like the timer issues were over a year ago and must have been resolved by now.  WRONG.  Setting the timer for 15 minutes I found it barely moved off of that setting after 15+ minutes.  My next mistake was to call Cuisinart to make sure there wasn't something I was doing wrong.  They offered to replace the oven and sent a prepaid UPS label so I could return the defective unit.  Returned the defective unit and checked today to get delivery of the new one - one week later they are \"getting it ready for shipment\" which means it hasn't even left the building yet.  They have given me a UPS tracking number but said not to check it until tomorrow afternoon or the next day.  The new unit will hopefully work fine, but it will be a long time before I want to try a Cuisinart again. \n  I bought this mainly for its air frying capability, and so far it has been very useful to my household in that way. Temperature control is not the best. Fries cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes end up burned, and it took many tries to figure out which settings would be best, which, for our purposes is 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes. We cook our potato fries, which burn faster than regular fries, at the same temperature for 10 minutes. We have different cooking times for chicken wings, depending on the brand. We learned early on to not follow the cooking chart that came with this device, AND to constantly check what we're air frying. I baked a small cake in it, which was neat, but again, we used a lower temp and a shorter time frame. It's easy to clean, especially if you line the drip pan with aluminum foil. The bottom slides out for easy cleaning as well, a real nice feature. I like its compact size and easy-to-use design. \n  Great toast. Great air cooked bacon. Everything tastes better. Works and looks great!\n \n  This has to be the best purchase I have made in a long time. It cooks very quickly which I love. Now here are  a few pointers... if you were to read the lower rated reviews what you you will read mostly is about the poorly made knobs and that it burns food. Neither is true. If you set the timer and see that your food is getting over cooked you cannot turn the knob to the off position. Those that tried are probably the ones saying the knobs broke. It must run its course. They will not turn back to off once it is set in motion. What you can do though, is open the stove door and take your food out. The oven will stop but the timer will continue ticking away until it goes back to its starting position. Burning problem solved and no broken knobs. \n  I love my new toaster oven.  It's on the pricey side but toasts beautifully.  The air fryer is fantastic though you have to be careful not to burn i.e. it works quickly and, at first, I had the heat up too high and would get burned edges.  Have enjoyed especially air frying veggies.  Have not yet used the bake cycle as have only had item for about 1 week. Crumb tray great.  Easy instructions for using all the functions.  Be forewarned that it needs 4\" of clearance from walls/cabinets so cannot be used under a kitchen counter.  My cabinets are 15\" from the countertop and item is 14\" high.  Fortunately, I have a wide enough counter that oven can be pulled out during use and then tucked back under the counter when not in use.  Be sure to read instructions carefully -and they are not consistent-But, previous reviews mentioning fire may be because instructions not followed. Always unplug when not in use or when cleaning.  Energy savings great as I will rarely use my big oven now. ENJOY!\n \n  Update: The function control knob is useless. I can only operate the oven on the Bake setting. Bought it Nov \u201819, started to break in the spring, now useless in July \u201820. \n  I did a head to head comparison of this unit with the lookalike but much less expensive Chefman. Both units have the controls on top, yielding a minimal footprint for the interior size. I much preferred the light in the Chefman and the flat wire shelf. The Chefman has three positions for the shelf, and the Cuisinart has two positions and a two position shelf. In the Cuisinart's upper shelf position, the food is mostly in shadows. Oddly, the Chefman accessories are dishwasher safe, but the Cuisinart's must be hand washed. Since the Chefman unit was also $60 cheaper, I wanted to like it. \n  I'm not big on writing reviews, but here goes. Received the air fryer/toaster oven combo last night. Set it on 350 and put 2 quesadillas in there to heat and crisp up for 15 minutes. Took me a couple of minutes to realize that the timer wasn't working. I set a different timer in the kitchen. Turned around literally 1 minute later and the quesadillas were just about to burn. Yikes! Used an infrared thermometer to check the temp at the surface of the baking pan when the oven is on 350. A whopping 570 degrees!! What?? \n  I had hopes!  After 1 week,  plug melted on back and it stopped working. Returning through Amazon, Amazon says to contact Manufacturer first to resolve, Cusinart says to return and pay postage and they will call me after it's received to discuss repair.  No thanks!  Returned to Amazon, no problem.  Decided not to buy this again.\n ", "\n  After looking at the reviews and even seeing the temperature control was a recurring theme I decided to give this a whirl based on the Cuisinart brand and figuring this would have been addressed by now. No such luck. I'd pretty much say it had NO temperature control. After burning the crap out of two packages of egg rolls trying different temperatures and setting I got an oven thermometer and tested at a coupe of different settings. At a setting of 350 it went up to almost 450 degrees and at 300 went above 400. \n  We replaced the stand alone stove that we seldom use with this appliance.  In honestly reviewing this I'll give a background. I learned how to cook on a blue steel pot belly stove that uses wood for two years back in the 70's, yes, Sears variety. My real stove was 1982, gas. From then on moved a lot and used gas, propane and electric. Family grew and had a childcare business, we outgrew the toaster and bought a DeLoghi convection toaster oven. Years later of heavy use with meats and probably  not cleaning it after each use, needed replacement as the inside was d i r t y as grease spatters go...I was tired after a few years of use/cleaning. This was my first attempt at air fry.  There is a learning curve with this oven, READ the manual and FB group info. I still don't clean it every time I use it, that is just the way we are and I love using it, but you have with most appliances we've found out, we are in our 60s. I now use after market silicone mats in the tray and air fry basket for certain methods of cooking and bought after market stainless steel trays in addition. We eat Whole Food Plant Based for the last 9 months and use this as much or more since we bake our own bread daily in it as well now. I love the Cuisinart Air Fryer feature for our oil free cooking. I also recently purchased the two burner (pic below) to replace the stove top. New appliances, cook bench my husband built to complete our kitchen galley, no stove needed and we have better space for both to enjoy cooking together. \n  It burns everything but toast! I have tried setting the temperature to 50 - 100 degrees BELOW what the manual says and it still burns everything. I tried to cook (frozen) fried shrimp and they were burnt 15 minutes before end of cook time - so. . . are they cooked enough for me to eat??? Now it's just an expensive toaster. (Toast comes out OK - set at lightest setting!)\n \n  We replaced our old toaster oven and our air fryer  with this.Its a little smaller footprint on the counter which is good for space, but you loose so much more space inside the oven proportionately that not much fits in there. Cooks very fast,we have burned almost everything at least once.  It seems after working with the oven and standing there babysitting EVERYTHING we cooked for about a year we figured out that we had to cook at very low temperatures and really watch whatever it is you are cooking in order to have it turn out. Takes a lot of practice to figure out heat settings and temperature. I always leave oven light on so I can watch the food it cooks so fast. Frozen food is especially frustrating as it tends to cook on the outside and still be cold in the middle.  We are replacing after a year- we loved our old air fryer and toaster oven- they each out performed this appliance even though they did not have all its capabilities.  Honestly unless you like burnt food and frustration- believe the reviews on this thing- I thought because of it being cuisinart, that I would go ahead and get it- surely those negative reviews were exaggerated- nope-I was wrong! They were telling the truth, it really does burn EVERYTHING!\n \n  It worked fairly well for 5 months. Now the mode selector knob won\u2019t turn. In order to utilize the warranty I have to find a box, ship it to Arizona (from Michigan) and pay them $10 to ship me a new one. I usually like and find Cuisinart to be good products, but I guess all good things must come to an end. Unless you can afford to replace it within a year I\u2019d suggest looking for something else.\n \n  When the oven works properly it is great.  However, mine has a bad oven timer knob assembly. Cuisinart has no issue standing behind their warranty, but they require the customer pay the return postage. The return postage cost 1/3 the cost of the item. I even asked if I could pay for the return postage using their corporate account to get a better rate and they declined. \n  Great counter top convection oven. I had a previous brand that lasted about 15 years. When it died I bough the Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven. It was surprising how much faster this oven cooks and crisps food. It is fairly easy to clean. It does take a little experimentation to find the sweet spot where to set the temperature to get the best results. My only not really complaint, but wish is that the timer could have more increments, especially below 10 minutes. This would help dialing in the correct setting easier. Sometimes it cooks so fast I have ended up with extra extra crispy food. I was surprised when I had stopped at McDonalds and got some fries with my meal. By the time I got home they were only minimally warm. I put them the convection over for 3 min and the came out great. Nice and crispy and most of the residual oil had dripped off them. They came out great, even better than if I had sat down at the restaurant and eat them there fresh out of the fryer. Much less greasy. You can cook entire meals in the oven in less than 1/2 the time it would take in a conventional oven. This saves you time, money and does not heat the house up.\n \n  was bigger than I expected and VERY heavy... I highly recommend that you use tin foil on the little tray because it WILL get that brown residue on it even after the first use...I was able to get it off with a combo of salt & baking soda, and after that, covered the tray with foil.  Everything is Knob controlled and it seemed wrong to turn it off by turning the knob because of so much resistance - I had to read the instructions twice to make SURE that is what you do to stop the timer.  The knobs turn easily clockwise,  but counterclockwise offer stiff resistance.  I thought there would be an on/off switch, but as I said, you have to just turn the knobs opposite.  The oven SHUTS OFF when you open the door...and starts again once you close it.  The timer continues to tick with the door open though.  Good safety feature.  I love that you can easily see the food cooking.  Be sure to monitor it because if you choose the Air Bake, things cook faster.\n \n  The only reason why I docked so many stars is because this appliance is refurbished and never did it say that!  The appliance itself is decent. It came looking like new and so far works great. The refurbished ones apparently don\u2019t come with the oil sprayer bottle (not that big of a deal). The biggest issue is that it only has a 90 day manufacturer warranty due to its refurbished status!  If I am buying a refurbished item, I should be made aware of that up front!\n \n  I have used this oven for awhile. As stated by others, it runs hotter than expected, but this can be overcome by using a lower temperature and keeping an eye on what you are cooking. ", "\n  The oven runs about 50 degrees hotter than what you set the oven at.  Even taking that into consideration and reducing the heat by 50 degrees, food burns quickly, especially the top. I cooked frozen french fries and they were completely BLACK IN less than 10 minutes. I made baked mac and cheese with a bread crumb topping at a reduced heat and the bread crumbs started turning black after 5 minutes. I had to scrape of the topping and cover with foil. I made a one pound meatloaf that I had to cover after 10 minutes because the top was turning black even at a reduced temperature.  The meatloaf was done in 45 minutes when it should have been at least one hour.  The bottom of the meatloaf was mildly burnt. NONE of these dishes, except the fries were cooked using the air fryer setting or the convection settings. Both the meatloaf and the mac and cheese were backed at the lowest rack height and yet the tops still burned. I just got rid of an old Black and Decker toaster oven that worked great. The only reason I bought this was because the oven was a bit larger than my Black and Decker.  The owners manual said to be very careful using foil in the oven and warned against foil touching the walls of the unit, but needless to say, everything needs to be covered with foil to prevent the top from burning. I returned this oven out of fear of the foil causing a fire and out aggravation.\n \n  We first used the unit on Christmas day for holiday meal.  Burnt my sweet potato pie with marshmallow toping to a crisp!  The marshmallows rose and contacted the upper heating elements, why I gave low marks for cleaning.  My significant other, a Navel Engineer, at first thought I didn\u2019t preheat the oven before placing the dish in the oven.  After several undesirable results, he broke out his electronics devices and figured out what was going on.  These are his result: \n  We just received our air fryer toaster oven and have reheated a homemade pizza and baked a turkey divan.  The pizza came out great, heated through and the crust stayed nice and crispy, just the way we love our pizza.  The casserole also baked perfectly.  Since we make smaller portions these days we hate to turn the oven on for such a small amount of food.  The toaster oven is going to work great for our needs, can't wait to try the air fryer, we love chicken wings.  It takes up little space on our counter, is really easy to use, so far we are very pleased.  My only disappointment was we did not receive the olive oil spray bottle.\n \n  The first thing I want to say is this is a massive improvement over my old toaster oven, which took forever to toast. It was definitely time for an upgrade, so I researched the market, and after reading so many positive reviews of this product, I decided to buy it. So far, I'm not disappointed. It opens up the kitchen playing field. I do not like frying in oil, so this is a great alternative. I've tried many items in the air frying basket, including pot stickers, and everything has turned out surprisingly well. Toasting anything is ridiculously fast. Yes, it gets hot in a flash. Like the reviews say, watch your food! The interior light helps. Baking is probably the trickiest function to master. I'm only willing to give it four stars because it is very unforgiving with fingerprints or smudges of any kind on the outside. Yes, the inside is easy to clean, but the outside and the removable pieces, not so much. Soaking is necessary after each use because food items stick to the rack and the basket. Additionally, this item, like so many others flooding the market, is cheaply made. The baking tray is a joke. My 11-year-old toaster oven's tray is at least 5x as heavy as the one that came with this product. You can just tell shortcuts were taken and weak materials were used, so I don't have high hopes for longevity.\n \n  Makes everything nice and crunchy. Air frying seems to result in more of a dry food (not as moist) experience. Wish I had know the accessory trays aren't dishwasher safe so be warned, even slight stains need vigorous hand-scrubbing to get rid of! Doesn't take up too much more counter space than the typical toaster oven and it's perfect for small meals. Overall, not bad for the price, depending I guess on what price you get it for as price changes on this item (changed on me within a few hours of buying it). Also, the instructions say to unplug it when not in use so that's an extra step to take with this appliance we don't usually need to take with others.\n \n  Absolutely love this oven. \n  Our Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven has been a wonderful addition to our kitchen. It was very easy to use right out of the box and the controls are pretty much self-explanatory. We opened our Cuisinart Air Fryer Toaster Oven in the morning, so why not make some toast? We laid two pieces of bread right on the clean drip tray and put the tray on level 2. Beautiful golden brown toast in just a few minutes and the drip tray even toasted the bottom side for us! The next batch of toast (what, we were still hungry!) was made using the regular oven tray on Level 2 with the tray down. Again, beautiful golden brown toast in just a few minutes that were toasted only on one side this time. Watch out when setting the timer for toast. This oven is so fast and efficient, it only took a very few minutes for the toast to be the right darkness for us. We put the timer on \"Light\" toast and it looked like there were a couple of minutes remaining on the timer when our toast had been toasted to perfection. If we had let the timer run out, it would've been well done, so keep an eye on it! \n  First off it did come with a bent grill that doesn't fit squarely inside the oven along with a bent frying tray. Other then the poor shipping care the piece is very nice looking but does feel cheaply made. However it does cook like a beast. Im never going to restaurants again!! lol!! I've cooked chicken legs, pizza, burgers, fish, and also as a toaster in the morning and baking oven rather than using my house oven. !!CAUTION!! The exterior does get hot especially the back gets really!! hot!! like hot enough to cause an instantaneous 2 degree burn if not careful. From my experience only when using the air fryer option on higher heat levels because the back of the outside I think is also the posterior oven wall. The exhaust comes out the back like the exhaust of a jet engine. On baking and toaster it barely gets hot tough. The heat is understandable since it is such a small device, I put it on top of my stove when using the air fryer so I can use the over head fans to suck out the heat.  I will fry until it cant fry no more. Everything comes out perfectly browned and crispy leaving the inside bursting with taste and juices.\n \n  I used not \"cook\" as it takes too much time and effort but just sticking stuff in the air fryer from a box and usually doing 350F @ 10 minutes can be good, 400F @ 5 minutes can be good.  Thick meat can be 30 mins @ 375F.  The light is the greatest option to have as you can see if it's burning or not and make adjustments.  The only problem is there are super hot and super cold sides so it's not Entirely uniform but it's good.  I think the right side = more hot than the middle and left.  Had a cold side as something was colder than the others.  Maybe they can fix in future releases or it's the only flaw of air frying.  Better than the Foreman which was great.  It would be nice if one side of the wire tray was open so you can slide things in and out instead of picking them from the top and placing them on a plate or somewhere else.\n \n  I received this toaster oven six months ago.  After setting up this toaster it has proved to work as described and i was satisfied with it's functions.  However a few days ago the toaster failed to operate and would no longer turn on.  I called cuisine art customer service and was informed I would have to send the toaster back to them.  This unit is very large and costly to ship.  They stated they do not repair the unit and would send me a new one.  Why do i need to send it in to them if they don't repair the units?  Customer service refused to accept pictures or video of the failed toaster oven.  So now i am stuck with no toaster oven for 2-3 weeks and a costly bill to ship it back to them.  Posting this review to help other customers understand there unit may FAIL AFTER JUST 6 MONTHS AND YOU WILL BE STUCK PAYING TO SHIP THIS CLUNKY ITEM BACK TO THEM.\n ", "\n  This is mainly a review of the service that Cuisinart provides, but it\u2019s worth noting the 2 of the heating elements had stopped working within 6 months, of very light use. \n  We live in a travel trailer and if you know anything about trailers you know the propane ovens don't cook evenly and are hard to light.  So, we bought this small oven and I love it!  It does so many things.  Last night I made fried chicken in the air fryer mode.  I have also baked a lot in it.  It's small, but there are only the two of us, so it's perfect for our meals.  It does seem to run a little hot, so I just dial down the temp on recipes and turn the baking rack half way through the timer to ensure even cooking.  It's been worth every penny and I'm very pleased with this purchase.\n \n  The air fry option is a definate plus. Makes excellent chicken wings & tator tots are crisp without any oil. The reason I gave a one star is one of the knobs broke off. We called the company as there is a 3 year warranty. No knob available however for $10. they would send a new toaster oven. The catch is we needed to ship back our oven. The UPS shipping cost for the return was $70.  For our cost of $80. we have a new knob. Terrible warranty!! It's too bad this has ruined our evaluation. The oven really works well. Lesson: be careful with the knobs!!!\n \n  This Air/Convection oven is a perfect addition to a kitchen! Especially if you enjoy cooking despite how hot it\u2019s getting summers. July was a killer for heta. Turned my little galley kitchen into an oven. Have a wonderful very large smooth top stove with an oven meant for family dinners. But it\u2019s now just me and hubby. Retired in Arizona. But I make the church communion bread! Nd Potlucks once a month. Been a chalkenge and the heat gets to me. So I bought this little air oven. Had a wonderful dinner tonight of fries and crab and brauts. Monsoon hit, not getting outside grill! For those who don\u201dt understand the bake timer, just gives you an estimate. Has a light. It\u2019s a new way f cooking with air so you\u2019ll need another timer and to pay attention to how fast it cooks. I\u2019m high altitude so have to watch everything I cook. Timing\u2019s  always off!lol It\u2019s the On/OFF switch so you don\u201dt over cook. I haven\u2019t had any problems. Love cooking with AIR!! Live and learn. It\u2019s an oven. You cook, it just provides the het! Doc\u2019s going to live my cholesterol now!!Recommend getting a spray oil bottle, found on Amazon, for when you want a mist of olive oil for flavor!\n \n  Great, versatile Oven! Reminds me of the old Ultravection Ovens from about 12 years ago. Solid, nicely designed, with heavy/durable basket and racks. Toaster oven, bake, broil, convection bake, convection broil, air fry. Timer. Door shuts solidly. Air Fryer will cook frozen breaded snacks, French Fries, onion rings, and the like in about 5 minutes straight from the freezer. Come out tasting and looking like deep fried snacks.\n \n  This oven attracted me because of the top controls. It uses considerably less countertop real estate than the old one, while still taking in a frozen pizza (yes, I know it is disgusting, but try to tell it to kids). But I expected more functionality from an oven in this price range. Was disappointed to find no pre heat option, where the oven would signal once the temperature has reached the preset value. I also found that it runs hotter than indicated- a prepackaged food would always burn if cooked according to the directions. Well, hotter is better than cooler. Overall I'm still happy with the purchase.\n \n  I've done measurements and \n  I researched high and low before settling on the Cuisinart TOA-60.  I wanted stainless steel cooking rather than plastic, multi-functionality, and a large enough capacity to cook a sizeable amount of food.  I waited a good while before writing this review because I wanted to give plenty of time to test out all of the different cooking options and my success level with each one of them. \n  Yes it cooks hotter then the dial says.  Mine arrived today while I was baking for the holiday so I thought it was a good chance to try it out on something simple; banana bread.  After cleaning the inside and racks/trays I ran the oven for 10 minutes at 350 to get rid of the new appliance smell.  Following what I have read in other reviews, I set the temp for 25F lower then called for in the recipe and set the time to 1 hour (max).  I checked it 25 minutes later and could see that the top was already browning so turned the dial down another 25F (50F less then the recipe called for), this seemed to be the correct setting as the bread turned out perfect. Note: that this was with standard bake, not convection.\n \n  I have only started using this oven this past month, it was a gift, and to late to return.  This ovens temperature control is way out of wack! I placed an oven thermometer in it to check since I\u2019ve burned four thing to a crisp when it was on the ", "\n  I have to be on a very low fat diet ( gallbladder pancreatitis) so I purchased this to help with cooking without fat. I spray my meat or veggies with PAM and it cooks beautifully!  I was craving french fries, which I couldn't have, so I cut up a potato, soaked in water, then dried and sprayed with PAM, this was a BIG game changer! Tasted like I had deep fried it and there is no fat! I roasted some curry chickpeas and they were crunchy and tasted so good just dry roasted! In 2 months when I can reintroduce fat into my diet I will still make food Like I have--using PAM and not oil.I have had no problem with the dials or being too hot. I love this appliance and can highly recommend it!\n \n  Takes up quite a bit of counter space. Racks are NOT dishwasher safe. Other than those 2 things I love it. Counter space is unavoidable but they really REALLY need to make the racks to go in the dishwasher. I use this all the time. Good for when you don't want to heat up a full oven. GOOD when you oven is full and you need to bake something else at the same time. The air fry cooks very fast, so be sure to keep on eye on it. Great for Fries, pizza etc ..the possiblities are endless.\n \n  I am stunned.  You can go from a raw potato or a raw sweet potato to full on french fries in 9 minutes.  I used to make \"baked fries\" in my traditional oven, and on broil they'd take 45 minutes and be pretty dried out.  With this thing, crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy in the middle.  And as a vegan, it makes the best \"fried\" tofu.  Beyond the health and calories of it all,  I like the taste of everything BETTER than fried food as it isn't so greasy and oily and heavy.  ALSO--it has a \"convection oven\" feature for warming up or baking things fast.  That's an amazing feature for a counter top item.  I honestly love this thing...my only issue is that I wish I had gotten this years ago.\n \n  Awesome, This is my 3rd toaster oven, my first 2 were Wolfgang Puck,the first Puck worked for 3 years, then went Kaput! My second Puck,was a Pressure Oven. What a piece of Junk! Lasted 3 months,Waranty was for 30days!. I have Air fried Pork chops,Fish,Burgers,fries,Mushrooms,onion ring, etc. Baked Casserole,convection cooked scalloped taters and ham, made a small hamlet is the best. I have a Problem with breaded frozen Tenderloins,I will try one thawed next.You must keep an eye on things until you get the hang of it. I burnt a few things,400,and about 10 min. for the norm, then flip, for a few min. on Air fry. Easy to clean, and so convenient.\n \n  This is my third toaster oven in 25 years. My last Cuisinart last 13 years and this new one is a replacement. I have had it only one week but have tried all of the functions at least once. I am still getting the hang of the air fryer function but it does a great job on bacon. The convection baking is amazingly fast, cutting normal baking times to about one-third of a recipe. I have only one criticism and it prevents me from giving this five stars.  The toasting function does not toast evenly on both sides. On mine, at least, the underside toasts more than the top when the rack is in the position stated in the manual. One sets the amount of browning desired from light, medium or dark. While types of bread will differ, I find it does not toast consistently with the same type of bread on the same setting as the dial is not precise enough to do it. \n  I have had my eyes on a air fryer since months ago but I wanted to buy an oven type to consolidate the number of appliances in my kitchen and since I use the toaster oven every day with my kids this was perfect choice. Well, I must say that I pretty much air fry anything now (even if it doesn\u2019t need to be air fried) everything is ready within minutes, regular chix nuggets that might take 10-15 in a reg Oven takes prob 5.  It\u2019s amazing how a efficient appliance can simplify your life.  Haven\u2019t tried that many air fry recipes since I can\u2019t be going to the grocery store everyday (quarantine times) to get all I need but what I have made is easy, fast and most importantly feel good not adding lots of oil/fat to my food.  Bottom line is, it\u2019s a MUST HAVE in everybody\u2019s kitchen (not only for air fryer).\n \n  This oven has only been on our counter for about three weeks, but we immediately recognized a few important factors in getting the best results from this oven. First, the temperate settings seem wildly inaccurate, but on the high side. This may be a reflection of the convection oven circulating the air, but even adjusting a recipe's recommended oven temperature down by 25F still produces results that will burn food to a charcoal black if we're not careful. Second, the metal sheet pan that comes with the oven is not a non-stick surface, and is not coated. It's a plain, metal tray. It took less than a week of use before the tray became permanently stained. For the price that Cuisinart charges for this oven, these two issues are inexcusable. \n  A few years ago, we bought an air fryer with the biggest basket we could find, not understanding the need for single layers and air circulation. Needless to say, we were quite disappointed and always looking for ways to create \u201clevels\u201d in our basket. It was also frustrating that we could never see what was happening inside! This appealed to us because of the glass door and the built-in racks. Despite some of the negative reviews, we gave it a shot and are in love! Our maiden voyage was chicken wings \u2014 what else? Golden, crispy, fall-off-the-bone, tender. So good we made them twice in one day! We\u2019re nervous about stripping the knobs and are being very careful. But otherwise? BUY IT! You won\u2019t be disappointed!\n \n  I was skeptical but have read a lot of people getting good results with an air fryer. So after doing some research, I decided on this one. Let me just say it works great! There is a learning curve to it learning how long and what temps to use but the air fryer is wonderful. It really does crisp things up nicely. Cooks a frozen pizza better and way faster than my conventional oven. Chicken wings will come out crispy and are one of our favorites. Oh and you have to try air fried tater tots... awesome! It has become one of our goto kitchen items. We use it almost exclusively now and our regular oven doesn't get used. This one isn't cheap but it works great. I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up!!!\n \n  Bought this back in Feb 2018...air-fryer does not cook evenly, even when you turn the food over. ", "\n  Bought this air fryer toaster oven a month ago.  Initially loved it, was getting great results.  But yesterday, in the middle of cooking some prime rib in it I noticed that there was smoke coming from the outlet it was plugged into.  I assumed it was the outlet, and unplugged the air fryer toaster oven.  I use this outlet all the time with no problems so I was puzzled until I looked at the plug itself and noticed it was melting around one of the prongs and that the bottom two inches of the cord was hot to the touch.  Unfortunately, I have already discarded the box, so not sure if I will be able to return it or not.  This is a real disappointment.\n \n  This air fryer/toaster oven is the BEST! however, you will burn EVERYTHING if you follow the quick reference guide for air frying that comes with it. I've found that reducing the temperature by 50-75 degrees and checking it frequently for cook time adjustments makes everything cook up beautifully. I promise, if you love the taste and texture of fried food and also want to eat healthier, this machine will bring you to sweet, blissful, crunchy food heaven! But it requires a few test runs. Please don't read the one star reviews and pass on this amazing appliance. You will not regret it!\n \n  I had been skeptical of air fryers as being a passing fad. I didn\u2019t want something so specific taking up space on my countertop. I did, however need a new toaster oven. After research, I saw reviews that this was good for both replacing my toaster oven and adding the air fryer as well.  I am pleased with both functions. It\u2019s great as a small oven and doesn\u2019t heat the kitchen like my wall oven. The air fryer feature is excellent. French fries come out crispy without the extra fat. Also great for wings.\n \n  Omg be still my heart!  I live alone in find no need to heat up an entire oven so I have been using the toaster oven forever.  I\u2019ve been wanting to get an air fryer but they\u2019re big and bulky and I\u2019d have no place to store it. THIS oven has broil, convection, toaster, regular bake and the plus of an air fryer! I have tried all of them and although everything cooks a little faster (not a problem) then it would in a regular toaster oven and even sometimes as quick as it would in the microwave..... if you know what you\u2019re doing the food comes out cut beautifully. It takes about a day to get it! Best deal and purchase in ages!\n \n  So far had had fun cooking lots of things.  First of all roast on the light setting was nice and even.  I replaced my old Black and Decker toaster oven which I really liked.  Next for breakfast I air fry some hash brown patties.  I had them on 450 and it only took about 10 minutes.  Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Next tried some chicken wings.  Did these for 450 for 20 minutes with a mist of oil.  You need to flip them so they brown on both sides.  Crispy and juicy.  Some of the smaller ones started to dry out a bit so you need to watch them and wound recommend moving them around.  All in all have had fun making \"fried\" foods.  It is hot so watch your food so you don't burn it. \n  Nice product but I give a overall of one!.  I am 80 plus and with reading glasses a flash light and magnifying glass the black on stainless  text is a pain. Cusinart has a newer model that Amazon does not stock. LED readouts. \n  The oven works Great, BUT the one thing I dont like is the oven is bigger than a regular sized microwave & the inside is rather small ....almost Toaster oven size....you can not put a 12 inch pizza as was originally stated in the AD which has since been edited since I bought this for my Son. The over does Air Fry...but Do not go by the Temps and Times watch the food carefully it can Burn and be a little un even in cooking  when air frying but I would suggest to drop the temp by 25-50 degrees and coking it a bit longer and slower.........if need to brown  at end , turn it up or switch it to broil real fast.......another option we are trying is to MOVE the Rack down.....they suggest to use TOP spot and as I said we found some items like tater tots can burn, or Tyson Chicken Nuggets.....they tend to burn a bit easy at temp and time they recommend......OH and DO NOT PUT the oil on the items to make then crispy most times it burns it! \n  This thing burns everything in the bake mode. It\u2019s ok as an air fryer but don\u2019t follow the manufacturers directions for temperatures and time or it will burn too. I love my GoWise air fryer & thought this would be a bigger better option with more functions but I feel like I wasted my money.\n \n  Wow this oven gets hot very quickly and so far has been much better than our previous Kitchenaid one. I was very disappointed with the Kitchenaid oven and it broke completely (wouldn't even toast anything) after a couple of years. Even our Black&Decker oven was better than the Kitchenaid. Black&Decker! \n  Not much counter space so I've put off purchasing an air fryer.  Then I saw the one that's a toaster oven as well -- had to have it!  And OH MY, I really like it.  I like the basket - can spread out the bacon slices or chicken wings; covered the bottom tray with aluminum foil and it's been a breeze to clean up.  The oven, so far, has been easy to clean - hope I can make the same review in a few months or longer but right now, BUY IT!!  It was a great purchase!  And it's not large - same as the other toaster oven I had but just a couple of inches taller.  And it's really a pretty small appliance!  I just hope, if needed, I can replace accessories from Cuisinart!\n ", "\n  I thought I would use this once a month, and I'm using it every single day. As a novelty, I bought some frozen chicken nuggets, and tried the air fryer, and wow! They are so good. I turn the light on inside and can watch them brown up; it seems to happen so quickly, you can SEE them cook. It's amazing. Super tasty. Very clean. A great size. I worried that the counter would get hot underneath, but it hasn't! I'm writing this review from work... and now I wanna go home and cook some more!\n \n  If I could give this less than one star, I would!  I've had this for several months,and I HATE it!!  The controls are not accurate at all.  Starting with the timer, 10minutes is rarely 10 minutes.  I could deal with that if the temperature were anywhere near accurate. Of course all the dials being on a tilt.may have something to do with the inaccuracy. I'm usually considered a very good cook, but even I can't gage how hot it will get because it isn't consistent in that.... Wish I'd never purchased it, and that I further didn't waste so much time trying to \"get used to it\" that I missed the opportunity to return it. I usually don't leave reviews, but peop should be warned not to waste their money!\n \n  Appliances that are designed with a metal case, such as a toaster oven, should include a third prong on its plug. This third prong will prevent you from being electrocuted by the metal case in the event that the device malfunctions internally. I read that it is important to ensure all of your small and major appliances that are enclosed in metal, have plugs with three prongs.  This toaster oven as a counter-top appliance is HOT and continuously blows our fuses at the box.  Never have had any issues or concerns with any other appliance!!!\n \n  I can't believe this thing costs less than $400. \n  So far we really like this toaster oven, It appears to be well-built compared to other manufacturers. The air fryer option is a large reason why I purchased this particular oven, the air fryer option works great, cooks quickly and the temperature is accurate. The only complaint would be about the general baking setting, the temperature seems to run hotter than what you have it set on. As for toasting it works great it toasts quickly and evenly. For those who have a small kitchen this may not work for you as this unit is pretty large and takes up a fair amount of space.\n \n  Look, I don't like cleaning so, whatever. Also, the temp knob is clearly too high. I burned something that should not have burned. However, that said, this thing is really awesome and It cooks meat and pizza really well. The air fryer is a wonderful feature that I have wanted for a while and tried to get in other toaster ovens by using a wire mesh rack but this is built-in and works so well. Can't say enough about it. If you need a toaster over, this is the one. (This is the first high-class toaster over I've tried. All prior TOs were cheap Walmart versions.)\n \n  It performs better than I expected. Air Frying is an especially outstanding feature. I mix fresh herbs such as thyme and rosemary with cracked pepper and other spices into different cooking oils, rubbed or brushed into meat and potatoes with time and experience will give you something that the best restaurants can\u2019t match. \n  We have had this product since last May and despite the fact we found it difficult to clean, we enjoyed its multifunctional capabilities. However...buyer beware: this month the knobs have begun not to work. Air fry works one day but toast does not, and the next day air fry only works by turning the toast knob. I would say that getting a year out of something that costs this much money is absolutely not worth it. This was a big purchase for our family, so it is a big blow to have to replace it so soon. We certainly will not be buying this brand again.\n \n  I love this oven.  Makes better toast than a regular toaster oven.  I use it mostly for that and air frying.  I have not baked in it yet.  If you are air frying something like chicken if the breasts or pieces are too thick and you use the upper rack slot the food may hit the upper coils.  It replaced two other appliances on my counter.  Be aware that you cannot place it under a cabinet unless that cabinet is considerably higher than the oven.  I was glad that I was able to place it under a cabinet mount microwave because I wouldn't have been able to use it on other parts of my counters that are not under a cabinet.  I recommend this product.\n \n  When I received this I saw the recommended airfry temperatures. Then I read recipes & they were way lower temperatures. The first time we used it we went with the cuisinart temps, but it burned. We lower the temp a bit and it's awesome  (About 50-100 degrees lower) bakes great, makes awesome toast, haven't gotten a crispy pizza crust yet, but we'll keep trying.\n ", "\n  I read many articles about air fryers and was not eager to buy one. Then I read review that the Cuisinart was the best in my price range (under $200). The top of the line was between $300 and $400. Not for me. So I bought the best for the so called Money. It is made too light for the heat it gives off. Foods burn easily at high temps even when I am watching them. Not good for toasting breads. I use it mostly for baked potatoes and potato wedges (it does a great job there). I can also baked fish fillets in the 325 to 350 range without problems. If you are uncertain, don't by it. Not totally worth the money.\n \n  I loved this air fry toaster oven when I purchased it Jan 24 2018.  I paid $199 dollars for it and did not have the money for  warranty...I figured I would be happy if it lasted 2 years...but nooooo....May of 2019 my cuisinart fryer/oven stopped working...the button that turns it on/off when door is shut no longer functions correctly...while the oven did work it was great but this product for almost $200 ought to have lasted longer than it did...I am on fixed income and unhappy with such an expensive product no longer working...It's now $199 dollars of trash...and not worth spending anymore money on it.  Think twice about spending your hard earned money for something that will last only 1 1/2 years.\n \n  This oven did everything we asked of it for about 13 months, then it died. The element would turn off and on and never heat up anything on any setting. We contacted the manufacturer. They  replied to our first email asking us for some information. We supplied the information to them and then that was the last we heard from them. I resent our reply email and they still never replied. \n  I bought my first one from sur  la table and it stopped working cold less than one year from purchase. Sur la table only covers for three months and the Cuisinart warranty of three years seems to be mythical. Repeated emails have resulted in zero response. So I bought a second one because my husband quite liked this toaster when it was working. He convinced me that I got a lemon and we should try again. I lost the argument so I purchased again. Will report if this turns into a lemon too.\n \n  I received the oven this a.m. I was so eager to try it out for our noon lunch so wiped it all down, inside and out. I was able to use the convection-bake cycle. Tonight, I made vegetables, using the convection bake. I had leftover sirloin beef in our freezer, which I thawed and again used the convection bake to heat it through (after thawing out). I grilled our garlic toast using the broil cycle. I really like the dials that I use for choosing which method to preparing foods. The inside of the oven is easy to clean. The basket will need to be soaked for a bit before washing, and the broiling pan. I would like it more if the pan was more coated with a non-stick, as this required more scrubbing to get rid of grease residue. I really am happy that I purchased this Cuisinart TOA-60. I anticipate using it for many foods, and I don't need to worry about heating up the kitchen. We are having 100+ in SOCAL, so this is practical to use for summertime cooking, as well as year-round. We are a family of two, so another reason I wanted a Convection Oven with the other choices for cooking foods. This oven makes cooking fun, again!  It's pretty impressive sitting on our countertop!\n \n  I bought this oven back in December 2018. I didn't really need it so I kept it in the box until yesterday  I've just opened it and try to used it. It is no use at all! Everything got burn! I baked cookies, bread, and meringue were all got burn before the baking time end. The oven becomes garbage now standing in my garage because I can't return it, the time frame for me to do a return is over. I definitely do not recommend this product to everybody. Just buy a professional  oven, it cost more expensive but you can use and keep it for long time and you feel satisfied.\n \n  Like: Stainless steel finish, good final dishes.  Air Fryer function leaves foods moist and soft inside and crispy on the outside for the most part.  Dislike:  Air Fryer rack and pan are not dishwasher washable.  The rack can be a pain to clean.  The Broiler function seems slow to broil.  The tray under the air-fryer rack feels thin and would be improved if it were a heavier quality metal.  Altogether though, I love it. \n  This thing for any other air fryer or toaster oven to shine. 5yrs ago we bought the Cuisinart pizza stone toaster oven and we loved it but now it is relegated to our outside kitchen. This new one works like a little oven. It has really good convection  for using it as a small oven and air fryer is fantastic.I often use it in place of my large oven. It cooks pizza is great and the air frying is even and fast. I like that its turned on with the timer because if you forget it, nothing burns\n \n  I was so excited to get this oven, but have been sadly disappointed.  First, you must buy special pans because nothing fits in it.  Air fryer is ok.  Toaster doesn't work well, it goes from barely toasted to burnt in second.  The worst part is that the oven burns everything.  Every thing.  I set the temp lower, I set the timer lower, no matter.  Everything burns.  It's awful.  Cuisinart doesn't care.  Not their problem.  I will never buy another Cuisinart product.\n \n  I bought this to try out the air fryer function. I wanted an air fryer for a while and thought I could get a combo oven along with it. The unit itself is nice, but is VERY difficult to keep clean, and sometimes difficult to remove the hot pans and racks when food is ready. The air fryer functional does not work that great. ", "\n  I like having this, but have had a lot of difficulty when air frying with food burning quickly on the outside while still not all the way done inside, but I am trying to make adjustments to the cooking process to see if it improves. \n  I have spent many hours on hold across several attempts trying to get Cuisinart to replace the unit. After a few weeks of use, the cord MELTED into the outlet. I had a licensed electrician inspect the situation. The outlet, electric to the outlet and the circuit/breaker/service/panel all checked out okay. However, when he was able to dislodge the cord from the outlet (ruined the outlet), it was evident the source of the issue was inside the cord or the unit itself. It melted the plastic on the plug and the plastic oozed into the outlet causing the plug prongs to shift--rendering the unit and the outlet a safety hazard. I cannot get through on the phone to get the unit replaced. So, I feel that it's a suspicious process to direct customers to a customer service number that is only open during business hours, and it is not adequately supported (if supported at all) by customer service agents answering the calls.\n \n  The oven was great, air fryer function is amazing, oven worked for exactly a year and then it broke. It\u2019s not easy to clean, the wire tray is not non stick and things get stuck. But we loved it. \n  Having many tabletop air fryers, NOTHING has compared to this. The  Heating Elements are Big. I use mine every day. I have been use to them breaking after 9 months, but this one died 18 months into it. The Return was the best I ever had, them shipping me my replacement in just a few days. The 3-year warranty works. I had purchased a 4-year replacement so I will have to see if the $11 for that was a good value for my 4th year of ownership.  Just love my fried Potatoes & Sweet Potato Fries. I use NO OIL and they are done in 9-10 minutes. \n  Really like this toaster oven. I have used the air frying, toasting, and baking aspects of it since purchasing. Seems to cook foods well. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have had issues with the baking pan warping. It doesn\u2019t do it on air fry, but on baking it has warped inside the oven making it very difficult to slide the pan back out. The pan has scratched the sides of the oven on removal. For future designs, it would be nice if the tray was attached to the door and slid out on opening. Kind of hard to remove items when the pan warps and it is hot. Otherwise good product.\n \n  Have been using for about two months now.  Retired my older Cuisinart.  This one toasts much, much better.  The air fry seems not quite as efficient as a single-purpose air fryer, but good enough.  I like the light on toast and bake. \n  This thing is AWESOME! No more soggy microwaved food. Bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos come out perfect. I've used it for sirloin steaks,  fish, hashbrowns, shrimp... I've cooked everything I can find and so far it's great. The steaks came out tender and juicy. Especially versatile since it's more than just an air fryer. One tip is the air fryer basket is made of wire and some foods like cheese may get caught. I put the basket in the sink and let it soak overnight and it wipes clean.  This thing would be perfect for a deer lease or camping trailer.\n \n  Okay.  I haven't even removed the product from the box yet, and as I checked Amazon for user guides and stuff on that page I find all these negative reviews.  I do find some good ones too.  I chose this oven for two main reason - the Cuisinart name and rep and Amazon's Choice.  Now as I read review after review and learn that customer support really sucks. I'm trying to decide whether to keep it or send it back untried.  Wish I'd researched further, but, odd thing, most of the negative info was way, way, WAY down the page.\n \n  Reading the mixed reviews I got the distinct impression that this appliance was a gamble. I have only had it for a week but I already retired my oven. Now that it is only my wife, my younger child and myself in the house (as opposed to the 5 original ones) the TOA-60 does all I need in the kitchen without having to preheat a large oven. I have baked eggs, meat, chicken, fish, air-fried a few items and roasted vegetables (delicious.) The results are always consistently of high quality. A bit of advice: turn the light on and watch the food often. This thing is fast and if you let it, it will burn the food. With a little practice, you will find that it's easy and the outcome delightful.\n \n  I replaced my small oven/toaster with this air-fryer/toaster so I won\u2019t have one more appliance to take space of my kitchen. My first air-fried dish is French fries, it only took less than 20 mins to fully cook the potato and the result came out great. I also tried the toaster function for my breakfast toast, it took only few mins to toast the bread to the way I like. Very energy efficient. The size is good for a small kitchen but the capacity is small. The advertisement says it can fit a whole chicken, well, they probably mean a very small tiny one. The only complaint is that I received this unit with a dent on the top (close to the back as shown in the picture). It is a minor issue but that is not something you expect to see from a brand new product. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.\n ", "\n  Great product. Highly recommend the stainless steel air fryer 100% worth the extra money. Previously bought one made of plastic & metal the food had a plasticky taste and the entire house had a weird smell after using it. This product is easy to use and quick to clean up. Works great as both an air fryer and toaster oven. Makes restaurant quality buffalo wings with ease. Only down side would be the size, it is more bulky than a normal toaster oven taking up more counter space. However, you can only fit a limited amount of food on the tray at one time. You will need to cook in several batches when cooking for 2+ people.\n \n  Only had this unit for around 3 weeks, I bought this because my wife and I have a meal delivery service (Home Chef) and almost every recipe calls for preheating our big oven. With just the two of us and the small amount of food that needs to go in the oven I thought this might make things easier. \n  I've had this now for about 10 days and have used it multiple times a day, every day. Love this machine works better than advertised if you ask me. I watched a bunch of videos and read a bunch of reviews on air fryers and decided on this one. One of my concerns with buying this one was that a few videos and reviews said it gets hot because its an air fryer so at first I was hesitant to by this one. What won me over was that it did everything my toaster oven did and was an air fryer which I had been wanting for a while but didn't want an extra gadget sitting on my counter. So, I replaced my toaster oven with this unit killing two birds with one stone. Gets no where near as hot as my toaster oven did, and I had a Cuisinart toaster over which I liked. Super easy to use, super easy to clean and looks great on my counter.\n \n  I use the oven several times during the week. I've used all cooking modes. I still use my little toaster for basic toast though. It is doing what I need it to do. I do not have to heat up my whole house in the summer to prepare small meals and that alone has reduced my cooling costs. I haven't experienced any wild temperature variations. It is a good idea to warm it up for a few minutes before adding your food. It made my chicken crispier by doing this. Cleaning it sucks. Oil and grease splatter is not that easy to clean with a simple wet cloth. But overall, I am satisfied.\n \n  If you dont already have one.... Your wrong!! I love this thing! You can do so much, and I know its not the key selling point? But no preheat tine. And cook time is faster. Case and point... those little Totino's pizzas? From Frozen to done ...9 minutes the box says 13 to 15 minutes I rest my case. \n  This is the best toaster oven.  I originally bought it to get rid of the separate air fryer and then I discovered that it was a very mean job what a pizza. The pizza has a lot more flavor than it did using my  Old pizza pizzazz. The air fryer also work very well I mostly do french fries and home fries oh and sometimes chicken.\n \n  I needed a new toaster. Got tired of bread getting stuck in it and burning. I decided to look at toaster ovens and then started to read about air fryers. I was afraid getting one appliance to do it all might be asking too much. So, I was really happy to find out that this machine makes perfect toast and great meals. We've made portobello mushroom fries, shrimp, reheated pizza and several other things which have all turned out great. It's also very easy to clean. It fits on my counter but does take some space. All said and done, we love it!\n \n  I love the air fryer feature so far.  Still getting a hang on the right toaster setting to get the correct level of toasting.  Keeping it cleans is a bit of a challenge but might be the case will all air fryer type toaster ovens.  The gets grease splatter and even through I clean after each use, it's still getting stained.  Also, I didn't realize that tray and racks were not dishwasher safe so if I noticed, I probably would have purchased the model with ones that could go in the dishwasher.  Other than the cleaning issues, it's a great product.\n \n  As I replied to another user\u2019s comments:  This oven bakes way too hot...I have been cooking for 60 years and I reduce the temperature at least 50 degrees and it burns before cooked thru.  I am not happy with this product.  I have bought many, many Cuisinart products but am really unhappy with this one.  I bought it in April so can\u2019t return it,  Thought it would just take time and patience, but so far, no.  I am certainly not a newbie so do know how to cook and bake but this calibration is way off, and I have had several toaster ovens that cook exactly as they should, even Cuisinart!\n \n  I wanted an air fryer but was always so disappointed with the basket size as air frying requires a single layer for the best results.  This offers a wide enough basket to throw in take out fries or cold delivery food and crisps them up so very quick.  Works great as a convection oven as well, and love that I don't have to wait 20 mins to preheat an oven that heats up the entire house.  Didn't care for the toast feature, just because a normal toaster will take 3mins to it's 15 but for every other feature it's much faster, and crispier.  My only dislike is since it's a new product and size there is no pre-cut parchment paper size so I'm cutting down my half sheets and if your using the air frying or convection setting and the paper is too tall or not secure in all 4 corners, it will be blown upward and hits the coils lighting the paper on fire.  Just a precaution as it wasn't something I thought about with air circulation.  You will love this purchase, but it is a large oven and pretty tall, it does take up a lot of counter space and barely fits under my cupboards so make sure of your spacing.\n ", "\n  We switched from a traditional air fryer to this because we thought the size and shape of it were going to be much better. However, we found that it has a little less of the air-fryer-effect on food, and a little more just like a regular toaster oven. Kind of a semantic difference, really, so we're generally very pleased with it. The biggest flaw it has, in my opinion, is that it is a huge pain to clean out the bottom portion. It has a tray that you can pull out to clean, but the opening for the tray to come out of ends up scraping off almost all of the stuff that the tray caught and then leaves behind little piles of crud inside the oven. It's frustrating but not impossible to manage. At any rate, it's still one of the best options out there.\n \n  I originally purchased the Bravo new wave xl, bu returned it as it was too large for my counter space. It needed atleast 5 inches on all sides which would have put it in an inconvenient location on my counter. I exchanged for the Cuisinart toa 60 as it took up less room and had the controls on the top instead of the side. I'm still trying to get use to the air fryer, having burned some stuff already. When pre heating the broiler, there is no indication that it has reached the temperature set. No bagel setting on the toaster. Not sure I would have kept it if I had not already used it. The jury is not in yet whether I made the right move by exchanging the bravo for the Cuisinart.\n \n  I previously had a toaster oven and a separate air fryer. I spent ALOT of money to buy this and combine two products. \n  I used this oven to bake chicken, cook muffins, and heat toast. It's easy to use and has enough head room to bake a small roast in it. It's great not to overheat the home with my big oven. \n  I moved into an efficiency apartment with a stove and no oven nor microwave.  Microwaves suck, so I splurged on this and I'm glad I did.  I use it for microwavey stuff like reheating frozen leftovers (pyrex food containers can handle going form freezer temps to 400 degrees no problem) as well as baking and roasting.  It does everything a regular oven can, just on a smaller scale, so it's perfect for a single renter like me. Since everything is stainless steel and it has that pull out crumb tray, it's easy to clean. I keep it on a stone tile countertop only 5 inches away from a shelf above, a wall behind, and my butcher block to the right. Nothing around it has ever gotten warm, it's very safe and well insulated.\n \n  So I've only used it a couple times but this thing is amazing. I wanted something that I could use in place of my microwave and this is it. It makes the most amazing fried chicken in about 25 minutes without all the mess to clean up. I really want to try wings in it, but they're really expensive right now, so I had bone in thighs that I used. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and only coated them in flour and patted them with oil. Need to get an oil sprayer... \n  Nice oven... looks good. But it doesn\u2019t provide a way to pre-heat and see the internal temp without a separately purchased thermometer. And worse, it does not calibrate properly. I have loved Cuisinart products for years. And I have bought all sorts of Cusinart products including a toaster oven years ago that I totally loved.  So I\u2019ve been particularly disappointed that I cannot bake anything in this that needs to be properly timed.\n \n  I got this not only as an air fryer, but to replace our old toaster oven. it works so much better all around. Besides being huge, it's just so fast. We have kids so we're constantly cooking things like chicken nuggets and such. We went from near 28 minutes (including warmup time) for a tray of chicken nuggets to about 8 minutes (from a cold oven) in air fry mode. it takes a bit of getting used to to make sure you don't burn things, but it is well worth it, just from a time saving perspective. We've made donuts, grilled veggies, fried chicken, and have even done things like reheated pizza in it. All of it came out great.\n \n  Love using this. It\u2019s great as a simple toaster, sure. The convection oven is terrific, heating anything very quickly and evenly (frozen pizzas, meat, pasta, etc) \n  Absolutely love this machine. Replaced an older model Cuisinart toaster-oven, a New Wave device and a 4 slice toaster. Freeing up much needed counter space. We have tried most of the functions- air fryer, oven, convection oven and toaster. All work extremely well. ", "\n  I got this oven because my old toaster oven was dying and I wanted an air fryer. \n  After researching for weeks between this product and the Breville Airfryer I was stoked to go with this model. Unfortunately after about a week of owning it I noticed that my food was burning when set at reasonable temps. I got suspicious so I placed my oven thermometer inside and viola. I found that when I set the temp to 300 after about ten minutes the oven was on 450. It operated a little better on Convection bake but still ran about 20 degrees too hot. Unfortunately I cant use this product at all now since the temperature knobs are unreliable.  Perhaps with the TOA-65's digital settings this will not be a problem. The size is great, the features are cool, but if it wont bake its gotta go in the lake.\n \n  I love this toaster oven. All features work great and the air fryer mode is terrific. It works great..things like Tator tots cook so quick and come out so nice and crispy. If I only used this for cooking bacon it would still be worth buying. Bacon is so quick and easy and comes out perfect. I liked mine so much I bought one for my mother in law and she loves it too.\n \n  If you want to do anything more than make toast, don't buy this product.  Our oven broke and our landlord won't replace it during the corona virus outbreak.  So we tried to go the toaster oven route in the meantime. We've used this product 10-12 times now and nothing we've made has turned out.  We've burned everything, despite lowering temperatures 50+ degrees and shortening cook times as much as 50%.  If it doesn't burn, it doesn't cook thru due to having  to turn the temperature down too low.  This thing is going in the trash if I don't throw it out the window first.\n \n  We use our Air fryer, nearly every night, for dinner. We've perfected doing Frozen Pizzas (Freschetta to be specific), Tyson Frozen Hot Wings, Ball Park Frozen Hamburger patties and Inovasians Egg rolls to name a few! This thing is awesome at speeding up cooking times of everything you can put in it. Cleaning however is a different story... not easy at all to actually clean the inside of the oven, and the parts say they are NOT dishwasher safe. Full Disclosure, we have run the basket and tray in the dishwasher with no ill effects noticed, but I am not say I am recommending doing so. I am however, recommending you get this one, if you are in the market for an air fryer you are going to USE!\n \n  I was a little put off be the bad reviews, but decided to try it anyways. OMGoodness, it is AMAZING!. I use silicone cupcake things to make soft \"Poached\" eggs and scrambled bakes that are perfect for English muffins, biscuits, roasted veggies and that is just the oven. the air fryer is brilliant! crispy chicken strips and wings without leaving the house. I've had sweet potato fried at least 12 times the last 2 weeks. A definite must have. \n  To start off with, I love this air fryer oven!! I just purchased mine after gifting one to my sister as a wedding gift.  She uses her all the time.  I have used hers on multiple occasions while visiting her.  I made the change from a traditional air fryer to this oven for the convenience.  Certain things like pizzas and sandwiches are a challenge to remove from the basket of regular ovens, and that won't be an issue with this one.  It will be very nice to have the oven style cooker, and will give us more options for cooking things like pizza and sandwiches.  It will also be easier to clean, as it has the pan to catch the drips and crumbs off of food. \n  I purchased this in January 2018. Within 6 months it broke down and didn\u2019t work anymore. It was dead. I contacted Cuisinart and they sent a replacement and we had to ship back the broken one. (A pain in the butt to do). Less than s year later the 2nd oven also just stopp working. It\u2019s dead too. This one is going in the garbage and we\u2019re purchasing a different brand. Shame on Cuisinart!! I expected more from a so called reputable brand. Will never buy another Cuisinart product again!!\n \n  I should have read the one star reviews and if I had I wouldn't be here right now.  There is no way you can use this oven to bake anything - everything burns.  Toast came out OK.  Tried to bake some chicken - burned after only five minutes.  Tried something else - same thing.  It's cheaply made, very hard to read or set any of the dials.  This is going back.  NOTE I recently returned another Cusinart product for the same reason - their convenction bread maker.\n \n  Best oven I have ever had!!! Heats up quickly, cooks quickly, browns evenly. Love this machine!!! My friends think it belongs in the space shuttle, but I think it fits my countertop perfectly! I have been using it every day since I got it and just love it!!!! The air-fryer basket holds a lot and the light in the oven is an added bonus! I did burn the cookies today because I was not paying attention. I tell ya, it cooks fast!\n ", "\n  The size, appearance, and accessories are all great. After reading reviews I have tried to cook several dishes and lowered temperature, but my food continues to be hard and brown at the surface and not cooked well underneath. I just tried baking mini cinnamon rolls and the surface started to get brown and the lower half was still raw. I have used both position 1 and 2 I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able \n  I bought one of these for my daughter and she loves it as much as I do the second one I bought for us.  The toaster is really nice and toasts faster than my standard toaster did.  The oven and convection oven cook evenly BUT my foods cook faster than at the same temperatures in my normal oven.  We love the air fryer!  It crisps up pizza, fried chicken, egg rolls, and other similar foods.  It makes delicious roasted veggies too.  Clean up is easy as the inserts slide right out for easy cleaning.  It takes up a small footprint on my counter, yet holds a whole chicken or a pizza!  Love this oven.\n \n  It takes cooking a few items to get used to but it works excellent. I made some restaurant style chicken tenders (Tyson brand from BJ's) and seasoned steak fries. Came out perfect. Re-heating pizza, chicken, etc, is fast and comes out great as well.\n \n  We heard about air fryers and wanted to try one. We don't use a microwave, only a toaster oven, stovetop and oven.  So when our toaster oven crapped out, we were looking at toaster oven / air fryers as a replacement. We cook everything in this thing! It cooks super fast, so it took some time to acclimate to this cooking speed. The only downside is that it takes a long time to \"toast\" bread, but that's because the inside is so large, and it's really not meant for such a simple task. If I want toast that bad, I just need to put it in sooner. Otherwise, I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.\n \n  I will try my best to make this short and sweat. This isn't my first airfryer. I loved the concept but the basket was so little in the ones I saw in stores. Here comes the Cuisinart. More expensive than the other brands but its bigger and it is also a convection oven and toaster oven. It was an immediate yes for me. Since being in the home I have to say that it is my most used kitchen appliance. I rarely turn my stove on. And my 12 year old loves it too. He cooks everything in there. I was a bit hesitant as people spoke about temperature control but listen....ITS AN OVEN. Any oven feels warm when you touch the door or the top of it. I don't know what thats a concern...warm. Not hot. It's truly a non issue. Don't push it against the wall which is a huge no no anyway, and you will be fine. Seriously I am in love with this appliance. Ive sent 3 of my friends to buy it to. Do yourself a favor and BUY IT\n \n  As an older couple we have found that we are using it more and more  for most meals. It is quicker than a standandard oven. The air fryer function does an outstanding job of cookig tater tots, french fries, and roasted potatoes. While it takes longer to toast bread than a regular toaster, when you toast four or six slices of toast, the time is shorter. All in all, my wife wonders why we didn't buy one sooner.\n \n  I put a whole chicken butterflied in there for about 30 minutes and it was perfect. Crispy skin, reached over 165 internal temp. All the meat was still moist. I\u2019m going to keep trying different stuff because so far this thing does not disappoint\n \n  My husband got this for me for Christmas and it has improved my cooking SO MUCH! Everything that comes out of this little oven is delicious. PLEASE NOTE: there is a learning curve for this oven. It cooks FAST and you have to watch your food closely until you get the hang of it. Its the prefect size and its fun to use. I am not a gal who enjoys cooking, to be honest, but this little baby has added value to my life LOL. Great product!\n \n  I tried to get this as a Christmas gift for my husband, but everyone was sold out! I was so sad, but I kept checking now and again because I wasn\u2019t going to give up on this! \n  I have had this air fryer for about two months. It has literally been used EVERY day since I have gotten it. My college student loves to cook fries in it. My keto dieting husband loves to cook all kinds of meat in it. I bake, fry, and cook everything in it. My husband boasts that this is the best kitchen gadget that I have ever bought (I love kitchen gadgets, and I but a lot of them).\n ", "\n  Xmas present, recipient seems very happy with it, still working on all the stuff she can prepare with it. Cooks faster, more thoroughly,  and cheaper than using large conventional oven to feed 2 people. She did buy a heat shield to put under it \n  I've only had my unit for about two months so I can't say with accuracy any thing concerning Durability, however I will say if your on the fence or are looking for a Air fryer, Toaster, Oven, and Broiler than this is the best I can recommend. It's looks are impressive, it saves room in the kitchen, and can perform so many tasks. Oh, and this may sound trivial but the Cuisinart makes the best Toast of any toaster I've ever owned and I've owned a few (LOL). I'm so very happy with my Cuisinart Air fryer/ toaster and I think you will be also. \n  I tried this to avoid heating up my kitchen in Texas hot summer weather.  I wish I bought it sooner.  It cooks beautifully, I've used it for air frying and baking.  Per another users tip, I put the temp. down a little and it works great.  I love the small area it fits in, and the convince is great.  I'm ordering a second one for my daughter.  I would highly recommend this product.\n \n  I tried buying this even after seeing several complaints about temperature issues with this. \n  Got this in the middle of January 2020.  Worked great until the toaster oven function stopped. \n  I finally tried the air fryer. Food-wise it's OK although some of the things (like chicken) would have been as good or better in a regular oven. Frozen french fries (Trader Joes). The air fryer recipe calls for 400 degrees for 15 minutes. In an oven, it's 400 degrees for 14  minutes. No advantage at all. Fish is perhaps the best if you want it breaded. Otherwise, use a pan or the oven. Clean up? 12 minutes to cook the fish and 20 minutes (not including soaking first) to get the basket clean. (And yes, I sprayed it first).  To me, this is no great shakes.\n \n  Purchased this to use while we remodel the kitchen. The oven arrived 4 days before we were to being and then my start date got pushed out by 6 weeks . I  wanted to try it out to make sure there were no problems and then pack away. It's now 2 weeks later and my family and I use this instead of our oven. This has every feature needed and cooks so fast. I timed with my regular oven and cookies, canned biscuits, frozen pizza & poppers were done in almost half the time. The air fryer made my Trader Joe Hash Browns hot and crispy and my homemade chicken strips were the bomb! AMAZING product!!!\n \n  Use it every day.  Gave away my toaster. Cooks everything faster than it takes my regular oven to warm up. Potato chips, hash browns, fries, baked potato, corn chips, flautas--crispy and oil free cooking.  Frozen pizza took 10 minutes (not 25 as recommended on package.  Frozen 2\" steak took 10 min on air fry and 5 min on broil. I'm already saving money: sweet potato chips, granola (5 min), french fries, roasted nuts (3 to 5 min).  All homemade and know exactly what you're eating.\n \n  Probably the best small appliance purchase I've ever made! Bought as a gift for a friend with dietary restrictions and she is tickled with it! She can now eat foods she loves without the grease and oil she must avoid. The lower power requirement than a full size oven coupled with baking and toasting functions are welcome bonuses. Highly recommend!\n \n  It is big and can handle a lot of food, and you get those great air fryer results.  The oven is great and it all looks good.  It would be perfect, except for one GLARING problem.  I cannot believe Cuisinart - supposedly dedicated to supporting Chefs and home cooks everywhere - did not even give a passing wave at timer settings under 10 minutes.  There are no markings, printed or etched to indicate a shorter time.  I'm not sorry I bought it, and I still think it deserves 5 stars.  But Cuisinart owes us all an apology and a decal to fix the problem.\n ", "\n  This airfryer oven is amazing! In two weeks, I have baked two different kinds of muffins (in 15mins start to finish), airfryed frozen tater tots (2lb bag done all at once- they came out perfectly crispy), airfryed frozen egg rolls (perfectly crispy) and made toast (perfectly toasted). This machine easily cuts cooking time in half.  I have taken the advice of previous reviews and reduced the temp by 25 degrees and reduced cooking time because like other reviews noted, it does run hot. Like any new appliance, you've got to get a feel for it but this thing, so far, does everything it says it does. Very happy with this purchase! Don't get just an airfryer, get an airfryer oven that can do MORE!\n \n  I love this thing! Tired of using a big over to heat / cook small things, also wanted an air fryer. This thing does EVERYTHING excellent once you get used to the temperature. Air frying is the bomb. We love tater tots, fries, wings, fish, etc. You need to really watch the doneness of things. It\u2019ll go from almost ready to burned in like 3 minutes. After burning the first thing I cooked I watched more closely. After using air fry twice I\u2019m a pro and the food I\u2019d fantastic. I also use it daily to toast a hard roll for a sandwich. It\u2019s fast and perfect. The knobs are plastic but I have no complaint. The only reason I rated the temp at 3 stars is it takes some getting used to. But once you get how hot and how fast it heats up it should be a 5.\n \n  I\u2019m obsessed with this. The timer/temperature controls are not the most accurate, but I really don\u2019t care. It heats up quickly, and it\u2019s a great size. I even managed to fit a whole frozen pizza in this thing. My home does not have central air, so my kitchen gets ungodly hot in the summer, which means I try not to cook/bake as much as I usually do. My gas oven creates a rather balmy atmosphere, and makes me want to die. This little baby is a godsend. It produces some heat around it, obviously. But nothing like my gas oven. I. LOVE. THIS. MACHINE. And that\u2019s just for the standard Bake setting. BUT ITS ALSO AN AIR FRYER. And it\u2019s gorgeous. Especially compared to other air fryers.\n \n  My husband and son love it!! When it comes to making things feel like it was just cooked one cannot go wrong. I\u2019ve not used it much as I\u2019m a more winter cooking person and can\u2019t wait to start making my vegan \ud83c\udf31 meals. I think they should of made the grease tray in glass as it can get hard to clean if left dirty over night.\n \n  This is a game changer. Food is ready is such a short amount of time and it saves the energy from pre heating out standard oven. \n  Had this oven less than a year. I am a one person household and did not use this a lot. It stopped working less than a year after purchase.. Its during this pandemic so I can't just run to a store to replace it with something else. Ordering another brand  online will take weeks. Very dissatisfied!!! I would rate this a zero if I could.\n \n  Would of gave it a one if I did't like the air fryer so much.  But really bought this unit as toaster oven first and foremost and it fails miserably in that department.  The problem is that is runs too hot and burns everything.  Using my digital thermometer below is the crazy range of temp this unit produced.  First I list the set temp and function; second I list the high low temp. \n  Love, love this oven!! I never use my big oven. It holds a good size dish. Toasting is perfect. I think if you are careful with the knobs that they will last for a long time. I do not need to pull it out from under the counter. It does not get hot. If I use it for a long time for cooking, like over 30 minutes I will pull it out just a little bit, but when I check it does not feel hot. I am using it now for about 3 months almost every day. The air fryer works perfectly. Made coconut shrimp. Perfect! Meatloaf. Perfect.\n \n  I have recently transplanted from my home to my mother-in-law's home, and she had stopped cooking back in the 1980s, so all her equipment was ancient and outdated. I had this Cuisinart toaster oven/air fryer  at home, and knew it's usefulness. I can toast, reheat food without cooking it (microwave), bake everything from Brussel Sprouts to burgers, as well as air fry chicken wings (my favorite - they do come out crispy) potato fries or anything you can cook in a full oven. It has a convection facility as well, but I am not a baker, so have not had a need for that. I use this every day!\n \n  I've only had this a couple of days and therefore have only cooked 2 things.  The first time I lowered the temp by 25 degrees and took some cooking time off as well.  Things were more 'done' than I liked.  The second time I lowered the recommended temp by 50 degrees and used the shortest cooking time for the recipe.  It was perfect this time.  So play with it to 'learn' how your oven works for the things that you like to cook.  This must use less energy with lower temps and shorter times, so that is good.  So far, I love it!\n ", "\n  I am very unhappy at this time. I bought on May 30 and return time up June 30 .. The metal tray is pitting , the fan has lost one speed , and no info about replacing light. Very expensive to go bad in 6 weeks for a Cuisinart. I have sent Amazon A letter asking for reimbursement.\n \n  I enjoy using this product yet the dripping pan stains. I have to use a small brush to clean the basket and the rack is the only piece inside that cleans easy and doesn't stain. I purchased the new black liner sold here which you can cut to fit inside the dripping pan. They really didn't develop a durable product as far as maintaining its appearances. Women who are clean and enjoy taking pride in they kitchen will not enjoy cooking with this product. The cooking elements are perfect and I love the timer. Just need to work on the design of the pan should have used a coating on the pan. I hope to find one myself.\n \n  We got this one to replace our old toaster oven and boy am I glad we did. It works so well and I now can make chicken wings in half the time it took to bake. They come out crispy! Mozzarella sticks come out perfect. I admit it takes some trial and error with different foods. I've learned this thing runs a little hotter, so if the directions say 400 degrees, I'll set to 350. Cleaning is a breeze. The crumb tray pulls out easily and from the outside. So much better than our basic toaster oven. Pizza comes out amazing.\n \n  Seriously, why did I not buy one earlier.  We have used this at least 3 times a week, every week since its purchase.  It has replaced our toaster, toaster over and half the time the actual oven.  The air frying takes some getting used to due to space but I think it's almost the same amount of space in other fryers.  The only real thing is the cleaning which I kind of wish it had a little more access to back areas and around the heating elements.  Last complaint is the timer knobs which I really do wish they added more ticks so that you can really set it to the precise minute.  But other than those 2 complaints, it was a great buy!\n \n  We've run so much through this in the week we've had it, and it's been great!  To the reviews that say 10 minutes isnt 10 minutes I timed this when I set it for 10, and it shut off at 9 minutes 47 seconds.  Great product!\n \n  I purchased it for the air fryer aspect in addition to being able to use it as a convection oven.  Also, it means that I do not have to heat up my big oven for most items.  Although I have only used it twice so far, I think it will become my major cooking appliance. Cuisinart needs to develop a cookbook for this item.  The pamphlet that was included isn\u2019t enough.  Additionally, how does one convert regular oven cooking times and temperature to a convection oven?\n \n  This oven burns on the outside and under cooks inside. Pizza turns out burnt on edges & soggy middle, one side of pizza more cooked. Uneven cooking. I\u2019ve experimented. Dropped temps down. Covering food. Made cookies yesterday. Terrible. Burnt top & bottom & underdone center.\n \n  Great product once you get used to it. It does have a few hang ups. \n  We are beginning to integrate this appliance into our daily routine.  So far, we have cooked French toast, breaded and unbreaded fish and fries, chicken wings, and we will soon roast chickens and ducks.\n \n  I like the options, works to replace Toaster so I can save a little counter space, but I bought it as an air fryer based on a friends recommendation.  I can absolutly recommend it, but most things I have cooked only take 10 min.  And be aware, if you try to use it as a broiler there will be smoke venting out of the unit.  Make sure you have good ventilation if that is your goal, especially if you so a burger (yep, I smoked out my kitchen).  I have not tried any baking, but as an Air Fryer or Toaster this works great.\n ", "\n  This toaster oven makes awesome toast!  My family uses gluten free bread because of food sensitivities.  My little pop-up toaster coluldn't get an even toast on the bread - the bottom 1/4\" was always \"raw.\"  This toasts perfectly with a crunchy crust and chewy inside.  We've baked a few things and \"air fried\" (new word for convect?) some frozen fries that came out brown & crisp, but we make toast every single morning.  Best $200 toaster on the market!  ;)\n \n  This oven is a godsend.  We use it more than our regular oven.  It gets used on a daily basis.  We have even purchased additional pans to use in it. \n  Overall happy with the purchase and we use it all  the time. Only two complaints. The first is that it does not broil very well. Bake, Air Fry and all other settings are fine, but not Broil. The other is why are the dial settings not lighted? Ours sits on the kitchen counter underneath a cabinet. Pretty common i would think. However, we actually have to use a flashlight to read the temp and cook settings. It would have been so simple to have lighted dials. What an oversight!\n \n  I love the size and different racks that are included! Perfect for every cooking need. Nicely sized but runs a little hot. Higher altitudes  adjust down accordingly. The air-dry and convection settings make it easy to cook a multitude of meats, veggies and baked goodies! I am happily satisfied with the quality and easy-to-clean features! I recommend this product for singles, couples and small families. Make sure you have counter space. VIP! USE A SEPARATE POWER STRIP FOR THIS PRODUCT ONLY. Be careful with young children as the unit and different racks get HOT!\n \n  I have to give this oven 2 thumbs up. I have tried various cooking settings and all preformed satisfactorily. Temperature settings were spot on according to my oven thermometer ( 350 degrees shows 350 degrees ). It\u2019s narrow but accommodates a 9\u201d cast iron pan with room to spare. I\u2019ve had counter top appliances before and they seem to have a short life span when frequently used and it\u2019s unknown how this one will do, but early on I\u2019m more than satisfied. I\u2019d buy this again and recommend it to others.\n \n  I use this oven daily.  First time I made something, I watched it like a hawk due to many reviewers complaining of burned food.  It does run hot so I usually lower the temp and cook time and it's perfect!  Crispy food in a fraction of the time.  My wings and chicken legs come out crispy and juicy.  It fits a whole pizza.  I love how I don't have to use the oven in the summer.  Best kitchen appliance ever!\n \n  Thus far I really like this oven. The toaster is fast. The oven does well and the air fryer is very good. Cooks fast and does produce fried items. This is my first air fryer. It\u2019s nice to have a multi functional device. The only down side is that things do have to be turned to get an even fry on them.\n \n  Terrible temp control ! \n  I only gave this 4 stars because it is not as non stick and easy to clean as it states. Other then that I love it. I bought this back in 12/18. My wife said it was just a fad. No way. I can't remember  the last time I used my oven. I will be honest. I call it my easy bake. I always wanted a Easy Bake Oven but being male my parents said no. I love this thing. nothing like the bell ringing when it is done. LOVE IT.\n \n  I have one minor complaint. The controls are not very precise. I don't mind that the controls are dial based but the timer needs to have markings for individual minutes and the temperature dial should also have more markings. Mine is only marked at the hundreds and fifties. Like I said it's a minor complaint, and the oven fries, bakes, toasts as expected. The oven this replaced was all digital so I'm just used to more precision.\n ", "\n  Performed as described and more. Easy to use and cleans. Personally I would recommend purchasing a stainless steel tray to fit oven as the tray is harder to clean and is dull. Other items are fine. Use it often and love the quality, Holds a 12\u201d pizza, makes the best air fried chicken, and bakes well. I reduce the temp and time when baking . It is highly recommended. The stainless pans I purchased from amazon are perfect and quite inexpensive.\n \n  I did a LOT of research before buying this oven. The first thing that attracted me was the commercial/industrial look with the big (easy to read) dials. The features such as air frying was a huge consideration plus I knew I needed the convection function. I have a big kitchen, but in the summer using my oven isn't an option, air conditioner cannot keep up. This is my compromise, but, after using it, I am not compromising at all, it really performs. Sure, its small, but it's just me living here, do I really need to eat anything larger than a 12 inch pizza or a 4 lb chicken ? Hint: the answer is No. I made chicken and waffles for dinner last night, air frying the chicken, I put the waffle in for a few moments and was rewarded with a nice crispy waffle, for me, that's a bonus !\n \n  I wanted the use of an air fryer but didn't really want to commit to that much counter space for one item. I was very pleased to see that I can do a variety of different things with this appliance. It's very nice if I want to make a small batch of biscuits and bake them. The air fryer feature is giving me access to my favorite foods in a much healthier way. As a toaster it is very convenient to toast as many as six pieces of bread at a time.\n \n  Update:  As mentioned in other reviews, the light is shoring out.  It \u201cfitzes\u201d and buzzes off and on when the oven is in use.  We shall see how long it takes for it to blow up... \n  So far I really like this product. We have made homemade pizzas, chicken patties and cinnamon baked apple slices, using the air fryer and all have turned out delicious. When first delivered,  I was going to return it because it is smaller than my previous oven and the cord is very short, but I decided to give it a try and it really cooks the food so nicely. And I realize now that the interior of the oven isn\u2019t a small as I had originally thought.  If you have ever been to MOD Pizza and love how fast their pizzas are made while still being delicious then you will love this oven. Because the pizzas we have made at home are just as good as MOD and are done in  about 6 minutes.  So really my only complaint so far is a short cord. However I was able to rearrange where I use it and it has worked out fine.  By the way I have compared other ovens and none have all the same features as this one for the same price point.\n \n  Quite a nice little oven, but I have a couple of reservations. First, you must always use the timer knob to turn on the oven. There is no option to just turn it on like my previous oven where you could turn the timer knob one way to turn it on the oven or turn it the other way to use the timer function. This means that, if you want to cook something low and slow, you must keep resetting the timer dial.  Secondly, the thermostat is not very accurate. Using the air fryer at the settings recommended seems to burn everything before it has a chance to cook through. I will be getting an oven thermometer to check its accuracy. Also, be sure to run a vent fan because the air fryer smokes up the kitchen and will set off the smoke alarm.\n \n  I find I\u2019m using this oven more and more And using all the functions. The air fryer is terrific. My only Negative  comment is that the timer starts at 10 minutes and because it heats up so quickly I have to guess where 1 to 9 minutes are on the dial. I\u2019m learning with daily use.\n \n  We purchased this a few weeks ago and are so happy we did!  Great air fryer and toaster!  Looks great on the counter as well.  We use it all the time now.  We've made chicken tenders, burgers, fish, fries - it's  been great with everything.  I wish the temp dial was digital vs. a turning knob, and the timer keeps going even if you open the door to check on something and the heat has stopped, but those are minor issues.  Very happy we purchased this and would definitely recommend.  We have several family members who plan to buy one now after seeing ours.\n \n  My conventional oven bit the dust and would cost over 250 to repair so I just bought this and it's really surprising how many features it has. I love convection cooking because it's faster and this little oven is a bit on the hot side so you need to under time it then check and add more time if necessary. Still have the top burners on my stove someday I may replace it with a dishwasher and 2 burners \n  We have had ours for a few weeks now and still learning how to use it. We like the quality of the cooking thoroughness and the versatility of the oven. Watch the temp though. This oven cooks fast. We like it so much, we are purchasing one for my mother who is no longer able to use a stove or oven\n ", "\n  Have only had for a short time but it works as advertised and I was able to go from 3 appliances to 1 - a great space saver.  Made fish in the air fryer and it tasted just like fried!\n \n  I have had this toaster over for one week.  The only thing I have used it for is toast.  Every time I use it , it blows the circuit breaker.  Not sure why it does this. Yesterday it blew the circuit breaker again and now it will not turn on. I have tried it in several different outlets and there is no power going into it.  Any suggestions ????\n \n  We like the oven, especially for crispy chicken without frying BUT shame on Cuisinart for not supplying quality stainless steel racks! And the size of the racks prevent replacing them with a better product,  They are difficult to clean even with spraying them with Pam before cooking or using foil.  Cuisinart should at least sell replacement racks made of a higher quality. I warn everyone about this deficiency prior to purchase.\n \n  The worst multi function you will ever buy. Please do not waste your money. The reviews are complete lies, this product is a complete fake. I'm not sure if the seller sold me a fake, cuisinart sold their name to be put on junk, or if Amazon is rigging their review process but DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. \n  Honestly, this has been one of  the best products we have purchased. However, after only three months, The dial stopped working so you cannot select if you want to bake, toast, air fry, etc. , Also, plug looked like it melted. \n  This oven cooks quickly!  We use it all of the time, and you have to pay attention to the heat - you can't set it and walk away.  The only other complaint is that the oven light burned out the first week (using it to keep an eye on the food so it didn't overcook), and it's not easy to replace.  Other than that, it's a great countertop toaster oven/fryer.\n \n  I'm in love with this!!! I airfry EVERYTHING now. It does heat up a bit higher than the setting, so beware. I used the medium setting for my toast and it was dark, but I just adjusted it back to light and its perfect. I'm making crab rangoons in this tonight- can't wait. I don't have to stink up my house with deep fried oil smell anymore and everything comes out super crispy!\n \n  I love this for all my toasting, baking, and air frying needs! It is a huge plus that I don\u2019t have to wait for it to preheat and makes dinners so much easier and faster. This is a large unit, which is helpful for me and not an issue because I use it for everything, but is something to consider if you have limited counter space. As far as the other reviews go regarding temperature, I have just lowered the instructed temp by about 15-20 degrees when baking and haven\u2019t had anything burn or overcook. As with anything, just keep an eye on what you\u2019re making. It\u2019s always easier to add a little extra time than burn your food! I definitely recommend!\n \n  This is the best multi-functional appliance I have.  It can air fry, convection bake and broil, bake, roast, toast and warm, all in a single unit,  it can replace single-use appliances and free up more space in your kitchen.  I use the air fryer feature frequently but I also like the baking, broiling and toasting features.  If you have never used an air fryer there is a definite learning curve.  The temp controls are not exact, but if you keep an eye on the cooking process you will quickly get used to how long it takes to cook your food.  I would definitely recommend this item.\n \n  I have exchanged this oven twice with Cuisinart. Once again, supper has come out of the oven burned, well short of the presribed cook time in the recipe. The thermostat is erratic and difficult to regulate. At times, the oven has reached nearly 200 degrees over the set temperature. (Set it for 350 and an internal temp gauge shows it reaching over 500.) This is not the kind of precision cooking equipment I expect from Cuisinart. I do not recommend this product.\n ", "\n  UPDATE: \n  I have only used this item three times, air fry wings / fantastic.  Convection roast..good but I accept that I have not used it enough to get it right, so I would say I'll start getting better soon.  Toast, I only had rye and did not notice any browning before the toast was getting hard, but that's probably due to the bread.  The oven is relatively compact and I'm very pleased with the location vs. size / I was concerned about that.  Very attractive item and I find myself staring at it often.  I am very pleased.\n \n  I purchased this as a gift for my SO. She couldn\u2019t be happier. In just a weeks time it\u2019s been given a thorough workout. Chicken wings, potato skins, rolls, toast, pretzels...the Bavarian kind, all came out fantastic. Take the time to read the manual then go online and check out what you can do with it. It\u2019s pretty incredible. It does get a little hot on top but you have to expect that. As to durability, only time will tell but it seems sturdy enough.\n \n  Yes, I believe this product does not justify what is says. The baking pan was replaced 3 times and every time I received a new one it still tarnishes. I used mild soap and cleaned it mildly like it says to do. It does not matter, because it\u2019s already tarnished after you cook with it and is a permanent tarnished mark. No solution will clean it even if you soaked for an hour or more. I tried it and still did not help. This is the worst product Cuisinart produced and very much surprise. Usually Cuisinart is a good product, but not this one. Please be aware. \n  After six months or so with this now, I don't like!  I over cook everything.  Never mind reading any cooking directions on new recipes, it only over cooks.  The 1800 watts is just too much!  And on this one, my Timer works just when it wants to, sometimes it does sometimes it don't so you have to look at another clock when you set this timer on just in case it's not working?  I'm looking for something else and I can't recommend this oven.\n \n  So glad I purchased. Takes little space on the countertop and does so much. I love the convection bake. Does not get the kitchen hot at all. The airfryer is awesome. I can fit a lot of items and cook all at once as opposed to the round airfryer I had. Even the toaster is great! \n  Lasted exactly 13 months and then just won't turn on anymore. Used 3 or 4 times a week. \n  This replaced to other supposedly commercial grade air fryers. Cooking time has been reduced by 50 percent. The price here is fantastic, because it also functions very well as a convection oven, and commercial convection ovens only slightly larger cost 600 - 800 dollars for ovens of this quality. (Remember to mark as 'helpful' or not as Amazon functions better with that data!)\n \n  Does what they say it will if you use as directed. You must watch and control temperatures because it does run hot, and use the light to look and see how your item is progressing. \n  Be sure to check the amperage of where you plug it in. ", "\n  I love this air fryer. The quality is incredible, it cooks fast and the food taste great. (Now I can enjoy wonderful handmade egg rolls.) How much do I love my air fryer? I\u2019m building a boat and plan on building a space on the boat to accommodate my Cuisinart TOA-60 Convection Toaster Air Fryer.\n \n  disliked unpredictable cooking times, as others have commented, must keep a close eye on foods cooking in this oven and what dishes to cook is very important. The design is poor and a danger.  While cooking a casserole and when pulling out the rack the cooking dish slipped forward and burned the abdomen area very badly.  Hot food spilled everywhere. Looks great, not very well designed from a safety perspective\n \n  I love this little oven. I\u2019ve been using it for a few months and I\u2019m quite pleased. I\u2019ve used the air-fry settings for fish sticks and fries. Takes a little practice to get the timing right for different items, but it\u2019s not difficult to get used to it.\n \n  This is a great oven.  I'm still having to learn the temperature settings for the air fryer but even with the few items I've tried that have started to burn before getting crispy they've been good.  The oven works great and it cooks items so quick.  Chicken from oven to plate takes only 15 minutes.  It also takes up less space than I expected and easily sits in a cover of the counter that I didn't use anyway.\n \n  We bought this POS on 9/13 and it stopped working on 9/27.\n \n  I had an air fryer that had the drawer but you couldn\u2019t see the food while it was cooking. My girlfriend saw this unit and liked it. I purchased this air fryer and it is attractive and easy to use. It has replaced my other air fryer and also my toaster. It cooks fast so you have to keep an eye on it. I cooked a three pound pork loin in about 18 minutes when the instructions stated in a conventional oven it would have taken 15 minutes a pound. \n  Broke after nine months. No longer heats up. Not sure if there is a manufacturers warranty but will explore. Temperature runs very hot so you are always guessing \u2014 every time a recipe called for a certain temperature, we would usually have to go at least 25, if not 50\u00b0 lower. Also doesn\u2019t fry very well.\n \n  We had a regular toaster over and wanted an air fryer.  While searching we found this toaster/convection/air fryer over and we absolutely love it.  Every feature works wonderfully and it has nice looking design.  We are getting rid of our old toaster over AND our toaster.  We highly recommend this product and have already talked a friend into purchasing one.\n \n  The answer is yes, yes I did.  I previously had a bowl style air fryer that was too small to make dinner for my whole family.  This air fryer is perfect for so many things. I really like the flat tray style basket.  It heats so much faster than my oven, so quick lunch items for my 4 year old are a snap.  I am so glad I bought this.  It sits out on my counter because we use it almost every single day! Great product.\n \n  With tater tots from frozen, it gives nice even browning across the oven, quickly, with convection. A friend has a round convection oven, it holds about 2/3 as much. We have large devices for sous vide and pressure cooking, because we cook for more than 2 and we don't want to make multiple batches. My sister had hers for about 3 years now, so they seem to be durable. This one is a keeper.\n ", "\n  Purchased this to replace my Oster toaster oven and XL Air Fryer and it's really a great product except the antiquated dials.  I guess that's to keep the price down and it was a good price.  Guess I'm just a digital girl!\n \n  Use this everyday as it has replaced my other small appliances. Since the size of the meals I cook has decreased most times I don\u2019t even need to use my convection oven anymore and can at times cook whole meals for my family in this.\n \n  The thermostat on this oven/air fryer does not work. It is unable to detect when it has reached the set temperature and it gets hotter and hotter. I have read and re-read the instructions and have tried all the settings but the only way I can use this thing is to baby sit it. That means putting an oven temperature gauge into the oven and then turning the oven on to the setting desired (bake, convection bake, broil, air fry, toast) and sit in front of the oven watching till it reaches the needed temp, put the food in, and the turn the oven either off or down to warm and keep your eye on the thermometer and then turn the oven on and off or adjusting to keep the temp where you need it. I can't even call it a glorified toaster oven because my little Black and Decker toaster oven will turn it self off and on to keep it self at a set temp!\n \n  We bought this to help get us through a kitchen remodel. It definitely runs hot, start with temp 25-50 degrees lower than suggested. I use peanut oil to coat food when using the air fryer. The air fryer basket is difficult to clean. Convection bake works very well. The capacity is good. I've made baked pork tenderloin with potatoes, large stuffed chicken breasts, etc. and there is plenty of room. It's definitely fulfilling our current needs.\n \n  I love this thing. I use it at my office because I had my child with me with the whole closing of the schools.  I did put foil on the very bottom under the heating elements fo easier cleaning and it works like a charm. It is used at least 5 times a week and I\u2019ve not had any problems or issues.  I did get a large heat resistant cutting  board to put under it just in case so I don\u2019t ruin the kitchen cabinet at my office but it does not really need it. My 10 year old can use it without my help saves me valuable work time.\n \n  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the air fryer BUT the first one I purchased after only having for a few weeks, the nob broke off,still under warranty I  contacted customer serviceand they, said I can return it for a new one, great, got the new one and low and behold the top of it is dented!!! I paid for a brand new one, expecting to get a brand new one in it's place and I am so bummed it came damaged.\n \n  This oven is fantastic. It toasts, bakes, broils and air fries to perfection. It takes a few uses to get used to using it, but once you've experimented with different foods, settings and cooking methods, a full size oven isn't even a consideration for most meals. Cooks quickly, toasts and broils evenly and the air fry is exceptional. While I've had several kitchen gadgets that end up in the back of my cupboard unused, I'll be using this one regularly.\n \n  We got this on sale over the holidays.  While we don't eat a lot of fried food, once in a while we'll make homemade breaded chicken strips.  This thing really does a fantastic job of mimicking an oil frier.  We've done tater tots out of the freezer as well as reheating left over french fries.  It's pretty amazing.  Fantastic as a toaster oven as well.\n \n  Everyone in my family loves this toaster oven. We use it for everything.  Surprisingly we use every single setting including the air fry setting ... and it looks stunning in my kitchen.  I had a visitor walk into my kitchen and the 1st thing they asked about was my toaster oven ... they loved it.\n \n  When our old toaster oven died, we finally gave in and bought this device which is a combination air fryer and toaster oven.  All I can is why didn't we do this a long time ago?  The air fryer works like nothing I've ever seen before. Cooking times are greatly reduced, everything comes out looking and tasting great.  I love this machine and wish we'd bought one earlier.\n ", "\n  I used the toaster function to make toast , also used the broiler to cook steak , melt cheese on my toast and the airfryer . All turned out very well , I'm still experimenting but I love it. The only change that I made was to use a bakers mat on the tray , as it saves mess and damage when melting cheese on toast.\n \n  I have had this product for about three months and I still cannot achieve optima results.  Cooks too fast and has set off my smoke detectors several times even though I have followed the guidelines, including the spacing/air flow.  Prior to my purchase of this product, I bought two of my adult children the Oster version of an air fryer and much better results.  Name brand does not mean better in this case.  I would not recommend\n \n  I live in small apartment and needed multi functional air fryer that will replace my toaster oven. This can replace your old electricity draining oven. It can toast, bake, broil, and air fry. I used all function but broiling so far, this is the best investment I made! Highly recomend if you want quiet, multi functional air fryer.\n \n  Whether it's in air fry mode or not, the convection fan will run albeit at a reduced speed. So we've figured that reducing the temp by 50 - 75 degrees F and the cooking time 75 - 100% the \"minimum\" recommended gets things cooked well. Biscuits were the most difficult to adapt because we'd get either gooey centers or burnt tortoise shells: 75 degree less, and 120% minimum time seems to work. This is a good, energy efficient alternative to the range oven option we have that takes at least 15 minutes to pre-heat and warms up the whole house.\n \n  The controls are plastic knobs directly over the heat/door.  They only work on low now, and the timer no longer shuts off the oven--so we don't use it, anymore.  The oven did a good job in the beginning, and it's still shiny and beautiful, but designing it with the knobs over the heat meant it wouldn't last.  We'll be sending it to the dump soon.\n \n  Works great. We've been air frying everything. It's super easy to use, other than the timer isn't great. It's hard to set the timer for a specific time. So we just use our Google Home to set the time we want. But everything else is great. Way better than the small basket that comes in most air fryers.\n \n  This airfryer is absolutely incredible! I was skeptical about how crispy various items would come out but it is truly incredibly! Everything we make is the best version we've ever had! Better than the oven, microwave, toaster, restaurant, etc! You can make so many different things too! We've made chicken, salmon, mushrooms, rolls, dehydrated apple chips, hot pockets, tater tots, crinkle cut fries, zucchini, bagel bites, cinnamon rolls and more! Everything is off the charts amazing!\n \n  This unit has a lot of positive features. Square shape and largest surface area for air frying. Also will make toas or toast waffles but a little slow on this function. Temperature control as good as you\u2019re going to get with analog control. Bake and broil are OK. It inhavent used these functions as much. Cleaning is an issue. Basket and pan not dishwasher safe. The inside gets greasy and needs to be cleaned after air fryong but this is probably true for all air fryers.\n \n  I originally was on the market for an air fryer. I\u2019m trying to eat healthy and have a weakness for fried foods. When I saw that this was a toaster oven as well as an air fryer I was intrigued. This thing is the best!!! So far we have used all the modes when can. For the air fryer, we have have main chicken tenders, empanadas and reheated mozzarella sticks. As for the toaster oven mode, it makes great toast, warms up frozen waffles well.  Easy to clean up. It comes with a Manual if how to use and it include recipes.\n \n  Love this air fryer.... it saves so much time and cooks healthier...  my husband and I are always trying new things in it.  It does frozen food so much better than anything else. Love that you can see while it is cooking...  tip while cooking... cook at at lower temp than usual... then turn up to get nice and toasted on top. Love this air fryer.\n ", "\n  The best air fryer that I\u2019ve used to date. I highly recommend this product! *note - make sure you place it in a space that is not near the stove. My first one burned out after a year due to the additional heat it received from the stovetop.*\n \n  I shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cget used to\u201d the quirks of an oven. If this thing works for you then congrats. Mine cooked way too hot and with wild temp swings verified by digital thermometer. Returned it and ordered a Cosori.\n \n  do not buy this product from this company they do not stand behind their merchandise. the timers, both toaster and oven, broke within a short period of time. the company refused a return/exchange of the product.\n \n  This is the top of the line product I was told! Very disappointed!  I've had this for three weeks and I'm still adjusting temperature controls. The oven gets very hot, and the timing is way off. Another reviewer said to subtract 50 degrees, and use a kitchen timer. I should not have to do that for the price I paid for this item. Also, the finish is peeling on the tray. Will be returning!\n \n  Seems to be well made and easy to use.  It does run a bit hotter from the thermostat setting.  I only use the air-fryer and the convection bake mode... both work very well.  Only suggestion I can make is that the hot air blows out the back of the oven...I placed a thin metal plate against the wall to protect the paint.\n \n  It took over a month to arrive (most likely due to COVID-19) but was worth the wait! Saves me from heating up the whole house with my traditional oven/stove. Cooks great on all settings. Huge time saver!\n \n  I was looking for a toaster oven when I found this. I had considered an air fryer before, but having it combined with a toaster oven and a convection oven??? I had to try it. I literally use this oven more than I use my actual oven. I am a huge fan!\n \n  Best toaster oven EVER!  Works great. READ THE REVIEWS and pay attention to temperature and time. Smaller space means lower temp and time required for cooking. We usually adjust about 50 degrees lower than suggested and about 2/3rds the time!\n \n  All I ca wonder is \"what took me so long?\"  I'm so happy with my toaster oven/air fryer.  It is such a delight to get things made in a short amount of time and in a healthy manner.  Even my 11-year-old grandson loves how quickly I can make bacon, fries, cup cakes, and cookies!\n \n  Hubby got me this and I love it!  The air fryer / convection bake really do cook faster.  Our favorite is sliced or wedged mini potatoes tossed in herbs.  My old regular toaster's crumb tray slid out the back, which was a pain; this one slides out the front.  My only complaint is the trays aren't dishwasher safe, which hubby didn't realize, but they survived.\n ", "\n  This Convection Toaster Oven AirFryer replaced two appliances that were on my counter.  The toaster has enough power to properly toast bread.  The oven is great for pies, cakes and even bread pudding.  Like all appliances, you need to lean how it cooks and adjust your recipes accordingly but on most items the settings are right on.  The air fryer works better than the dedicated air fryer it replaced.  Over all we are very pleased with the purchase.\n \n  I was needing a replacement for my toaster over that stopped heating. After looking at several options and researching, this is the model that we decided on. I use this toaster everyday. The size was important to me, as well as ease of cleaning. This model meets my expectations. It cooks in half the time of a large oven and is so easy to clean. I also like the little fryer basket that comes with it. The basket makes it possible for the door to be cooked evenly on the top as well as the bottom.  I use it to cook breakfast and lunch mostly everyday. We leave it on the countertop and it doesn\u2019t take up too much space.\n \n  I purchased this air fryer mid-May.  Functionality of unit has been great.  I clean the interior after every use.  Ability to thoroughly clean top portion of the unit is inhibited by heating elements.  After using last night, the oven produced a fair amount of smoke.  Used only dry rub on wings before use.  I called Customer Service to ask whether there was a way to remove grease build-up on roof of oven.  ( Don't know how there was grease build-up since i clean regularly).  Their response was they could only state what the manual states which is warm soapy water.  Worried that unit may catch fire.  Tried again, unsuccessfully to clean top.  Not pleased with unit now or response of Cuisinart Customer Service.  Probably will be reluctant to purchase another Cuisinart product in the future.\n \n  This was a gift for my 26 year old daughter. She is an excellent cook and wanted a nice looking air fryer that also had other functions. She was used to Cuisinart products because she had them growing up in my home. When she left to set up her own home, I wanted to make sure she started with quality appliances. She says this air fryer is awesome.  Very happy with the purchase.\n \n  I love this oven. I use it several times a week. It\u2019s easy to clean.  I don\u2019t have to heat up my large oven for something small.  I had hesitated for a couple of years about getting an air fryer.  But having the air fryer in a multi use appliance is perfect. All functions work great, whether you\u2019re baking, broiling, air frying or making toast. One of the best gifts I ever bought myself!!\n \n  I LOVE this item. All of the options make it one of my go-tos, especially when I need a quick hot dinner. This honestly changed my life! Sometimes I use it in conjunction with my regular oven to quickly bake other veggies, make a side, etc. WORTH IT! \n  Cooks a bit hot and it's kind of bulky but ther than that it's amazing. Just need to be mindful of that cooking hot thing when cooking. I'm finding new things to cook everyday. Tomorrow I'm making a rack of ribs in the air fryer. \n  I tried to broil something and it never did work. \n  This thing is freaking amazing. I don't leave reviews often, but after our last toaster oven crapped out, we bought this one as a replacement. It cooks food almost too fast (in a good way) and too perfectly. Haven't found anything yet that cooks better any other way. This thing is quickly replacing our standard oven and even microwave!\n \n  This toaster oven is the biggest waste of money. As soon as i received it and made my first meal in it i realized the temperature was way off. I was warming up my kids chicken nuggets which are said to be heated at 415 degrees for 10 minutes. They were burnt to a crisp. I now heat them up at 300 degrees and they still come iut dry but not burnt. The air fryer works the same way. Burns everything. I kept it and just lowered the temperature significantly but now the sensor isnt working so i cant even toast anything. There are too many glitches. I am going to try and return it. Please dont waste your money on this product it is highly defective\n ", "\n  VERY disappointed with this unit.  Cuisinart is asking me to pay for shipping when the product is defective.  I won't be purchasing another Cuisinart product!\n \n  I\u2019ve been wanting an air fryer but have limited countertop space. When my old toaster oven broke, this seemed like a great option to have both.  I love this thing. Does everything I needed it to and makes awesome crispy chicken wings. I\u2019m excited to find more recipes to air fry. I\u2019m pretty sure a whole chicken will fit in there.\n \n  I had a little bit of a learning curve in using this oven. I was so used to leaving the other ones I had on max temp and just using the timer to control the cooking with all the others. You have to actually set the right temps and functions with this one or you will get a lot of burnt results. That being said, if you repect it, it does a great job on everything I cook now.\n \n  I am rating this product only by the feedback I have gotten from my son and daughter in law, since it was a Christmas present from me to them.  They use it every single day.  They have 5 children, so you can imagine the workout it is getting in their house.  I think they have used all the features and have had no problems with it at all.\n \n  When using on oven it cooks really fast and you will burn stuff as you get used to using this as an oven. I tend to microwave stuff for a little while and then put in here for a quick crisp. \n  We replaced our toaster oven and a heavy and awkward to use air fryer with this dual use convection oven/air fry appliance and could not be happier! It works as described, takes up much less space than our old appliances and is much more energy efficient than our full oven. Must have for retirees like us who tend to cook fewer \u201cbig\u201d meals!\n \n  This is great. We haven\u2019t had a toaster oven in since college.  This has everything you could ever want. Just make sure you have clearance under upper cabinets per dimensions.  Only thing to be careful of is temperature.  Either it\u2019s very hot or my large oven is not very accurate/hot.  This takes much less time to cook but also has a much smaller margin of error.  Don\u2019t leave in too long or you will have over cooked food. All in all amazing\n \n  I don\u2019t know that it was the machine but it was definitely the vendor, it came with a ding in the front of it and the light doesn\u2019t work as soon as I opened it out of the box.\n \n  Purchased in mid-October; have used it just about every day since.  I use the air fryer for pretty much all of my protein dishes--chicken, steaks, hamburgers, fish fillets, scallops, etc.  as well as veggies.  I bake apple slices in the convection oven.  I love the pull out tray on the bottom--so easy to clean.  The unit fits nicely on my counter under cabinets with clearance for heat dissipation.  I would buy it again.  I love it.\n \n  Hard to clean, not dishwasher friendly, items take long to cook and it's small.\n ", "\n  This thing is great. \n  So far I really love this combo unit. I wanted to try air frying but did not want another appliance to keep & store. The toaster oven was replaced with this. I have toasted, baked and air fried and it all works great. I saw a lot of complaints with the timer but I timed it with my phone timer and it is accurate. Air fried wings & bacon so far with great results!\n \n  We recently moved to a smaller home and I didn't want too many appliances on my counter.  This is perfect, it's a toaster, air fryer, oven and convection oven all in one.  I've used all the features and it works great!  So happy with this!\n None None None \n  \u00a0I bought one for my sister as a house warming gift. She seemed to like it so I bought one for myself. New out of the box, I turned it on to test it out. I was surprised by a terrible noise. After unplugging it I traced it to the fan blade rubbing against the interior shroud. The motor shaft and fan blade were fine but where the motor is mounted was warped. It's extremely thin metal. I bent the mounting plate back into shape and it sounds fine now. I shouldn't have to repair something right out of the box. It's a design flaw. This is the first Cuisinart product I've had any problems with.\n \n  Tried it twice.  Both times some of areas on the food were burnt and some were barely cooks.  Following Cuisinart\u2019s directions, which called for French fries to be at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, I found areas on each fry was already starting to burn after 6 minutes. \n  I like that it is compact so it does not take up as much counter space as my previous counter top ovens. Some people with larger families would need a larger oven. I did buy some items (muffin pan ect.) to fit this size.It does hold a 12\" pizza. It is better insulated so as not to heat up the room.. It heats up real fast, saving time.  It makes great homefries in a jiffy.  I baked a chicken that came out great. Very jucy and tender. I thought I would need a rotissery to get such good results. Not so.  On The negative side. - The dials could be easier to read. The temperature setting are hard to fine tune.  I acciddently left the tray in the oven before it was cleaned. It had a small skim of oil that baked on and now it seems to be there permently. It does not look pristene any more but does not hurt the performance. Otherwise cleaning is easy.  I assume it to be efficient but I do not know it.  I\n \n  I use this all the time.  My rental didn\u2019t have an oven, but this baby easily made up for it.  Preheats in no time.  Fits a 6x9 Pyrex for casseroles.  Reheats pizza to perfection.  Buffalo wings...delicious!  Usually set the temp below what a recipe or box recommends.  Be careful with frozen pizza, I blackened an entire digorno.  It lives on my counter, looks nice, works great.  I\u2019m also convinced \u201cair frying\u201d is a fancy new term for convection baking.  Cheers!\n \n  In anticipation of the delivery, I bought a bag of frozen wings and a bag of sweet potatoes.  The wings were fantastic!  So crispy, just delicious.  The sweet potato fries didnt turn out like I hoped, but that was my fault for leaving the temperature set at the wings temp.  So they got a little \"chocolatey\" :) .  I'll try them  again, but next time I'll set the temperature correctly.  Even if I could only do wings in this thing, it would be worth it!\n \n  A very nice product.  Came fast looks great.  Only cons I see. Not a lot of space to cook multiple items at once and temp seems to run a tad hotter than what's dialed in.  And there no constant on mode  other than that.  It's made great pork chops and brownies and I forsee enjoying it for a long time to come.\n \n  I\u2019ve never owned an air fryer so I have nothing to compare that feature to.  It seems to air fry well and turns out very nice crispy chicken.  My problems have been with baking and broiling.  It doesn\u2019t seem to get hot enough while broiling to put a good char on a steak.  The steak comes out more like an overdone piece of roast beef.  Baking it seems the temp is much higher than what the thermostat shows.  Jiffy corn muffins, which I\u2019ve been making for over 30 years, are black on the outside and raw on the inside.  I\u2019ve lowered the temp 100 degrees and after three attempts I\u2019ve still not been successful.  I didn\u2019t have any of these problems with my previous less expensive toaster oven.  Overall, quite disappointing.\n ", "\n  Within one month the plastic knobs cracked and broke off.  Superglue helped but the dials are of very poor quality.  After 14 months of use, it died.  No power, no function.  When it did work, the cooking results were fine but, over all, it was not worth the price and not at all what we expected from the Cuisinart brand.\n \n  It burned within ten minutes of baking at 350 \n  After having a smaller air fryer with a basket, I upgraded to this larger appliance.  No more cooking in batches because it is large .  The one thing I am very disappointed about is the tray inside. It is not dishwasher safe so you have to hand wash.  It seems cheap and only after five or so uses, I am searching for a nicer replacement.\n \n  It was great while it lasted. One day it just stopped turning on. Cuisinart provides a 3 year warranty on this item but requires that you pay to ship it to them for repair. They require that the shipping is also insured, and that you enclose a check or money order for $10 to cover return shipping. After owning this for 1-3 years, is it worth it to pay the shipping and handling to have it sent in? I don't know how much it would be to mail this big, heavy, toaster oven back to Cuisinart, but it wont be cheap.\n \n  Bought this oven  because of the multi-functional aspects.  We have used to to air-fry and to crisp up meats.  So far have  been very pleased.  The oven is easy to clean and so far has met our expectations.  With regard to durability  the oven is well made. Since I've only had it for less than 1 week I cannot opine on how long it will operate as it does now.  I can only state that if you want an oven that does more things than just air fries, this oven meets the bill.\n \n  This product was initially very good and easy to use.  However, it began a slow decline in operation after one year where the roast setting stopped working, followed by the toaster  setting shortly thereafter.  Very disappointing after such a short time of use, suggesting the product reliability is fair to poor.  Also, this oven is next to impossible to clean.  Will now look for another that is not a Cuisinart.\n \n  This oven works great so far. First pizza I put in I let it warm up and put it in for the designated time but I still burnt you don\u2019t need to let pre heat witch is cool second pizza tuned out great but cooked it for about 3-5 less then it told me to so keen that in mind other said it takes longer then a normal oven mine cooked it fasterSince there\u2019s no pre heating and it heat the food fast even just on bake . If it breaks I\u2019ll write another review. But so far so good \ud83d\udc4d\n \n  I don't understand the hype around this oven... it is SO loud and difficult to use. The pans are low quality and lasted 1 use. I ended up giving it away and buying an Oster which was even cheaper but better quality - BEST DECISION EVER! Seriously... don't buy into the hype. Would never recommend to a friend.\n \n  Absolutely LOVE this appliance. I have air fried veggies and French fries as well as convection broiled steak and chicken. The toaster function is amazing. All of the food has turned out perfectly ! It\u2019s the perfect appliance when you want dinner ready in 15 minutes. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this Cuisinart counter top toaster oven. I have a tiny kitchen and this oven fits perfectly under my kitchen cabinet.\n \n  Love my toaster air fryer. Use it every day. The solid tray looked ugly after the first use, didn't affect the machine, it just got marks on it that won't come off. The wire rack and tray are fine, a pain to clean but it's worth the effort. I've talked 2 of my sisters into buying this same machine.\n ", "\n  I needed a toaster oven, and found this.  Its great for pizza, tater tots, hommade fries, homemade chicken nuggets. \n  I have been using this for about  a month now. It bakes beautifully.  Toasting does depend on where you place the bread in relationship to the  heat source.  I did have to get used to it turning itself off when I open the door but after a while I realized this is an important safety feature for many of us.\n \n  Love my new counter oven! I was looking at the more experience Br.....e brand, but couldn\u2019t justify it. This one performs very well for me. I am still learning about air frying and must watch my foods closely, but overall this oven is wonderful!  The drip pam stains easily but just line with foil or parchment paper and you are golden.\n \n  This is the best purchase I have ever made! \n  We really love the fact that this Air-Fryer is built into a conventional toaster oven instead of having another appliance that stays in the cupboard, we replaced our existing (non air-fryer) with this one and we have been enjoying it very much.\n \n  Most foods are done in less than 5 minutes which is amazing when you have growing teens. The food is so crispy and no oil needed is amazing. And the user manual it recommended spraying some foods with cooking spray to get an extra crisp but trust me you don't need it. 10/10 would recommend this.\n \n  I bought this as a gift for my parents and they love it - they hardly use their normal oven anymore and definitely don't use their frier! There was a problem with the left hand knob, it was never quite \"right\".  I searched the internet for a replacement but they are not made according to the manufacturer.  Cuisinart ended up sending them a new unit!\n \n  I am so glad we bought this product.  We have only had it for about a week but I've toasted bagels, made cauliflower, and last night air fried Ranch Chicken Wings. \n  O MY GOD. THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. This machine has made cooking soooo easy. I am a Dental Student and I am always short on time. This air fryer cuts my meal prep time in about 1/3. It makes everything I love very quickly and it makes it healthier. It\u2019s a great addition to any kitchen and it even bakes. \n  It will burn your food outside, and cold inside. I heat up pizza for my kids, and although I put the temperature way down from what was recommended, it still burned all cheese and pepperoni outside, but inside the pizza dough was cold. Ugh!!\n ", "\n  This pretty much does what I want, toast is fine, as are air fried items.  Baking...well this thing runs pretty hot, even the keep warm is too hot.  I compensate by lowering the temp when on the bake mode by at least 25 degrees, and sometimes more, and still have to keep an eagle eye on things\n \n  Quick heating and fast cooking. This replaced our Oster large oven that took forever to get hot and would not recover when you put food in. The first time I cooked bacon, I burned it because I wasn't watching, second batch was perfect.\n \n  Although I Expected it to be a little larger in size when I first saw it... This machine is Awesome!!! I have cooked Everything from nacho's to Turkey Burgers to hash browns in this thing for about 4 months now and has cooked everything perfectly and Super Quick!!!!! Great Machine from a Quality Company. Just Get One!!! :)\n \n  it took little getting used to the ticking noise of the timer - but man does this air fryer toaster oven cook food beautiful- getting rid of my 4 slice toaster my air fryer -so much nicer to have it all in 1- the bagels come out toasted and soft & chewy  like they should -love this product\n \n  I have used an airfryer for years. Just received the Cuisinarts beautiful one they offer. Got it a good Black Friday deal. I have not cooked in it yet because I wanted to try the temperature settings because so many have complained about it. I put the thermometer in the machine and turned it on 400 bake. It took a good while to preheat and then it jumped to 550. They aren't even supposed to go up that high! That things was HOT! All of a sudden the temp drops down to 300!! Unless you are prepared to stand guard by your new oven DO NOT PURCHASE!! I should have listened to the reviews. Glad I didn't try to cook in it!! I have sent an email to Cuisinart to ask what in the world is going on with their products now. I thought they merchandise could be trusted. NOT!\n \n  This oven is great , works well for what we use it for ! Makes great French fries , and it's the best toaster . Just wish it was a little more compact . It does take up counter space and when you air fry there is a lot of hot air that comes out of the back of oven . In general I would say it's a nice oven !\n \n  I bought this on February 15,2020 and really enjoyed it until it died! Two months later, $130 later and I have a broken Cuisinart oven. DO NOT BUY THIS EVER! It is a rip-off. I bought this because I\u2019ve always known Cusinart to mean quality. I guess I was wrong.\n \n  After several failed recipes, we decided our unit had to be broken, so we sent it back. (Thank you, Kohl\u2019s for such easy returns to Amazon!) \n  When our old toaster died, I wanted to jump on the air fryer/toaster bandwagon.  I have serious regret.  We used our old toaster for everything.  In contrast, this toaster burns everything!  I have tried turning down the temperature and/or shortening the cook time but then items are undercooked in the middle and still nearly burned on the outside.  The recipes that I made from my air fryer cookbook were no better than items I would normally just roast in the oven.  This toaster belongs in the trash.\n \n  I'm in utter disbelief, trying to figure out I how lived life without this. It's simply amazing, the only feature it doesn't have is rotisserie, but I don't even care. It's a phenomenal product, it turns your food into a masterpiece! The pictures are a turkey burger and salmon, I can taste the right now, flavorful and all the juices locked in.\n ", "\n  I like everything about this toaster oven - it works as it should, and I use it as a toaster, oven & air fryer.  I have one unit now that does what I had 3 devises on the counter doing.  I would highly recommend this toaster oven - and as large as it is, it doesn't really take up space, because it is tall there is lots of room.\n \n  What I like the best is the versitility of one small appliance that does multiple functions well. One caution would be that it does run hot. I\u2019ve lowered the temperature by 25-50 degrees for everything I cook. As a single empty nester, I rarely use the oven on my big range.  it\u2019s important that this  appliance performs and so far it has exceeded my expectation.\n \n  Love this new oven.  Only thing is the pan got dirty and can not be cleaned.  I use aluminum foil each time I cook and when food gets under the foil, it is very hard to clean.\n \n  Traded in an old oven that did not air fry for this one. I absolutely love it. Have two college kids home due to Covid - they can cook frozen pizzas in 7 minutes, air fry frozen wings and chicken tenders in under 10 minutes, I use the air fry for salmon and it\u2019s amazing. Looks good, works great. Space saving too. Toasts well and quickly - recommend highly\n \n  I admit i expected better; temp control was very spotty with oven mode usually running way too hot; use a thermometer. Oven timer knob broke on third use and toaster timer just quit working - admittedly it did make good toast and toast mode could be used for most anything we used the oven for. Will look for something else to replace.\n \n  We used this for just over two years (usually at least once per day) and I really liked it, except that anything I tried to air fry burned. However, the power supply burned out and it no longer works. For $200 I should be able to use it for more than 2 years before it craps out.\n \n  I really wanted to love this product, but after using it for a month, I just want to return it. The temperature is just so erratic. If it's set at 350, it will go to 425 after 10 minutes. It's burned 2 pizzas, an egg casserole and biscuits. Even setting the temperature lower and baking for 2/3 the time called for, I still have over-done food. \n  I would think twice with this product. After a few uses, the heating elements blew up. Almost started a fire. Returning to manufacture. Also when cooking it tended to burn the food. We hand to reduce the temperature to prevent this from happening. Only had this less than a month. When researching, also noticed other comments indicating that it cooked fast and burned food.\n \n  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the fact you need to pull it out / can't use directly under a cabinet or it will overheat and be a fire danger. LIterally every other aspect is terrific, I've been making wings like crazy and it's so easy to do even standard oven dishes in a third the time\n \n  every setting cooks the same... BURNT - unless you stand in front of the oven, checking the doneness of the food constantly, things go from raw to char in a glance.  the dial thermostat and the equivalent of the dial \u201cegg timer\u201d are not accurate, nothing digital, nothing assuring. ", "\n  Great product and now I can get rid of every other appliance. The first unit wouldn\u2019t power on however Amazon shipped a new one the next day. \n  Works well and we have used it quite a bit. Took some trial and error but we can now make homemade air fries, and have figured out breaded chicken tenders that are quite good. I knock it a star because the baking tray is not dish washer safe and the t tray won't quite fit a frozen pizza.\n \n  I absolutely love this! I use it everyday! Threw out the toaster and use this all in one for less clutter. The air fryer is amazing and makes the best hot wings and hash browns in a flash. Baking is fast and easy as well. Several of my family members and friends have ordered their own after trying mine.\n \n  This is a great product, well designed and very versatile . Hi quality and easy to use. Does toast nicely, browned on both sides. The \"big oven\" must be jealous.\n \n  I can't believe It!  It really works!  I can't tell you how much better my food tastes with the air frying option.  I made the simplest dish;  chicken rice and veggies (all leftover) and put in in a tortilla wrap.  Sprayed with oil, and WOW!!! I'm sold.  So excited to make traditional fried foods like a bloomin onion and \"fried\" chicken!\n \n  Love this oven!  It just a bit larger than previous toaster oven in width and length it is taller.  So it fits in the space I wanted. Cooking is a breeze. We love fried chicken cutlets, now I am cooking with very little oil and no mess on the stove and I do not have to stand and watch it. I cook 10 min then turn over for another 10 min.  I use it for veggies, excellent. Overall, love this oven\n \n  I read the reviews and knew going into this purchase that there were complaints about it running too hot. OH MY GOSH, it runs TOO HOT. I thought I could figure out the difference and just lower the dial to compensate. This is one of the most disappointing kitchen gadgets that I've ever purchased. :(  I wish I would have returned it. Very suprising that Cusinart released this with the known issue. My opinion of Cusinart has now changed. I used to think they were a high end company.\n \n  Tried the air fryer and had to watch as it still would have burned the fries.  Baked muffins and cookies to trying to adjust the oven temp and still went a good 100 degrees hotter!  Have other Cuisinart appliances that are great but they need to start  over with this oven/ fryer.  Controls are not exact for the temperature and all are hard to read as writing is small. \n  My wife loves the simplicity of the controls, it is very easy to understand and clear to see exactly what function, temperature and time the oven is set for.  She returned an expensive digital one because it was harder to program than a vcr for multiple recordings.  :)\n \n  Love this oven so far. Haven\u2019t tried the air frying function yet but it bakes my gluten free chive/cheese muffins better than my conventional oven!! Excellent purchase. ", "\n  I purchased this in August 2018 and it is now useless.  The temperature control was always a problem as it overheated regularly and burned food.  \"Air burnt\" is more accurate than air frying with this piece of junk.  The toaster is complicated and slow.  Now, the bake and air fry aren't working.\n \n  2 knobs broke within the first year.  I had to badger Cuisinart with emails but I did receive a new unit today.  Let's see if these knobs will last......UPDATE:  It cost $59 to ship back the damaged unit plus $10 to Cuisinart to ship my new unit.  All in all I've spent $270 for this toaster!  Not worth it!!\n \n  I absolutely love my new air fryer. I made Colombian style empanadas, which are usually deep fried but with very little oil the results were amazing!\n \n  Nice looking oven. Works fine. It does get very hot in the back. I just bought a heat shield at the hardwear store. Problem solved.\n \n  I love not having to use the oven from my stove.  The air fryer part is fast and makes food delicious. The toaster makes better toast than the toaster, but takes a little longer.  I use it EVERY DAY.\n \n  Bought this for the air fryer function, which does a fine job. Oven itself - on just about all settings - tends to run hot. I had to cover a one layer cake with tin foil and lower heat to prevent burning before the cake was done. Other than adjusting heat, I have no complaints. Did wish it could hold a 9x13 pan, but that is relatively minor.\n \n  It gets REALLY hot, but it has to if you want air fry or fast toasting. What this means is that you have to pay attention. If your food burns it\u2019s your fault, not the toaster. If you can\u2019t handle a powerful tool, don\u2019t buy it. If you buy it don\u2019t complain if your food burns; it\u2019s on you.\n \n  We enjoyed the toast oven/air fryer combo and used it several times a week. We went to use it one day and only the toaster function works. It started working for a couple days again later and then stopped. Very disappointed in the short lifespan of the product for the money spent.\n \n  Pleasantly surprised, was not sure which reviews to believe. It is good quality, cooks fast. Need to watch so doesn't overcook. Crispy outside moist inside. Have not used the microwave since we got this, very satisfied looking forward to trying different foods in it. So glad we purchased.\n \n  We LOVE this, I use it at least 1-2 times a week.  In the heat of the summer it was perfect to use instead of a hot hot oven.  It is not fun to clean, as everything sticks to the wire basket no matter how much I spray it, and I don't think it's dishwasher safe so I soak and scrub by hand.\n ", "\n  It burned everything. So, I put an oven thermometer inside, set it to \"bake\" and 350 degrees. As you can see it went up to 450 degrees. Probably would have gone higher, but I turned it off. I heard air circulating, so I think it's going right into air fryer mode.\n \n  Love, love, love this airfryer/toaster/oven! It's versatility makes it one of the most used items in my kitchen. I especially like the air fryer, which is perfect for french fries! This oven is easy to use and easy to clean, with a bottom drawer that slides out for easy cleaning! A must have for every cook. A+++\n \n  It replaced my old toaster oven because I didn\u2019t want another item on my countertop and it makes the best toast! It crisps up food so nice on air fry option. I never had a different air fryer so I can\u2019t compare to the smaller versions but I have to say that this one is fantastic! It has a large surface to put many items. I\u2019m still getting used to the how fast the food cooks and browns. But I love it and I use it everyday. I recommend it to everyone. Spend the money in this one -  you will use all the time.\n \n  I have used the air fryer frequently and as pleased with the results. I monitor carefully when cooking meats and have good results with chicken, pork, salmon, and bacon. Also good results for frozen fries and potato crowns. In addition, I have used it successful for vegetables. \n  1. The fan stays on even when not air frying so the top of your food can overcook quickly. I've put the solid pan in the top, above my food to prevent that. \n  I wasn't sure I would like this because it was a little expensive, but it has performed very well.  I can air-bake very quickly and most times not even have to use my big oven anymore.  I wouldn't even mind taking this camping.  Very good product and cooks evenly.\n \n  This unit replaced my previous air fryer as well as my toaster oven.  It has much more capacity than my previous basket style air fryer so that it is much more useful. It works well so far!  My only caution is to watch it carefully as you get used to it.\n \n  Bought this to replace a regular toaster oven.  Absolutely love the air fryer option!  I do find that things cook really, really fast with the air fryer option though, and even the convection cooking.  I had to keep an eye on everything I cooked until I got used to the timing, but now I use it all the time, for everything!  Great quality, great product!\n \n  I'm still learning how to use my new toy. I only \"over-cooked\" 2 things & the dog loved it. I use it everyday. It's really not hard to use, I just don't pay attention to the cook times as I should.\n \n  In the short time I have had this unit I have cooked fish, whole chicken, steak, pork chops, beef roast, hamburgers and everything came out perfect, we now use it as our primary toaster. We replaced a high end top load air fryer with this unit and it was a great decision.\n ", "\n  We call it the science oven.  There is nothing like it, this is the best toaster oven / fryer on the planet.  This cooks fast and crispy in minutes.  Don\u2019t walk away from it because this baby gets hotter than the surface of the sun in  .2 seconds.  It will turn a frozen pizza into charcoal in about 10 min.\n \n  Really enjoying this oven!  Air fried foods cook  evenly, toaster works great.  Broiling was not a huge success but only tried once and may have had a setting wrong somewhere.  It\u2019s just me and the hubby now so this is large enough for us to cook dinner in; no need to fire up the oven. The wire mesh tray is tough to clean but overall, I\u2019m a very satisfied customer.\n \n  I love my new Cuisinart multi-function unit.  It seems to bake/fry hotter than the set temperature so it took some getting used to.  Toast feature is spot on.  Only thing I haven't tried yet is the broil.  Definitely recommend it!  Also, I thought it would take up a ton of space on my counters but it really doesn't.  No more than my old toaster oven. Just taller.  I don't have it under any top cabinets.  I'm fortunate enough to have a row of cabinets that don't have top cabinets so it works out really well.\n \n  Good product BUT, NO user guide.  Not even 3 or 4 pages.  That is uncalled for.  I have to go through their customer service for a basic users manual!!  For this much money, it doesn't make sense!\n \n  This oven just died less than a year in. It is very expensive to claim the warranty-- $10 for the shipping plus the shipping fee for the returned broken oven, which came to half the original cost. Got the oven and found its temperature settings are totally messed up.\n \n  Very disappointed with the small numbers and lettering on the dials. Also, the baking pan is extremely hard to clean and took a very long time even after using strong cleaners. Would like to return it and get a better one.\n \n  I had an old Cuisinart toaster oven that I used all the time to cook in that I loved.  This new one is even better.  It has airfry setting that is wonderful.  Also the old model had crumb tray removal from the back if the unit.  This one is in front!  This actually replaces my oven.  Absolutely love it!\n \n  Out of the box the oven timer didn\u2019t work. We\u2019re using iPhones to measure time. Now a few months after the toaster timer broke too. Your bread just burns because it never stops. The timer needs to be reliable. We should\u2019ve taken it back but it\u2019s such a big time we decided not to. We got a lemon.\n \n  The timer knob broke!  When I called customer service the rep said they DO NOT have replacement knobs available, they said to replace the entire unit!  I am 72 years old and have enjoyed and depend on this unit for preparing my husband\u2019s and my meals.  Having to replace the ENTIRE unit is causing me to do two things....number one...rethink buying Cuisinart products and ...number two...do extensive research into replacement part availability from other manufacturers!  I am very disappointed.\n \n  It ran so hot. We had to buy a oven thermometer to test why everything was burning. You also can\u2019t twist the timer back to zero, you have to let it run out of time. We had it 2 weeks and had to return it. I would not recommend.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s toaster and air fryer in one. I don\u2019t like too much stuff on counter space, so this made best sense. Had it for a month and use it on almost daily basis. Super crunchy and heat is distributed evenly.\n \n  I never thought We would use it as much as we do. A bit of a learning curve for me. I tried to set temperatures as directed and found the outside of food getting burned while the inside was not fully cooked. Turned down temperatures a little and all is well. My wife has this dang thing mastered and it now probably the most used item in the kitchen. Love it for reheating food. You can even make McDolands frys taste good again with the air fryer. Now that\u2019s a test. Great for baking small batches like fresh cookies. But hit with the 4 year old.\n \n  This product completely died after 1.5 years. We loved it and used it daily so when it quit you can imagine our disappointment. For the price, this should\u2019ve lasted MUCH longer.\n \n  Did a lot of research before I bought this air fryer/toaster oven.  Wanted to be able to look at food cooking as well as bake a 12 inch pizza.  Great reviews, except notice one about running too hot.  First thing I cooked was brussels  sprouts. set temp. and time. had 3 minutes to go and they were already burnt.  Same with chicken wings. \n  stopped working after 6 months.  timer works, but not the oven.  worthless for so expensive.\n \n  Am disappointed that the pan and basket that accompany the Cuisinart are not dishwasher safe.  It functions well, but is not easy to clean.\n \n  I have only used the oven twice for toasting and once for air frying (a new thing for me) but am very happy so far.  It's a small thing, but the interior light is great--nice to be able to easily keep an eye on what you're cooking.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with it!\n \n  1800 watts is a great idea for saving on utility bill.  I have had several toaster ovens but I really didn't like the way they made toast it was too dry.  I had two slices and they came out pretty good.  I believe I will get a lot of use with this oven.  Cuisinart is a great brand so I am sure it'll last a good while.\n \n  I purchased the sir fryer afterhaving a stroje.it has been a lifesaverfor me everySenior needs one un he home it cooks wonderfully with verylittle cleamup. you dont have to worry abiut burns or fires shuts iff automatically after time set has ended. Awsome!\n \n  Love that it does everything, my one complaint is that when air frying the basket is so close to the elements on top. Wish there was more room to put larger cuts of meat in without it touching the elements . Right now that is the only con I have about it. Very quiet, easy to clean.\n ", "\n  I purchase this oven even after reading all the reviews about it cooking too hot and thinks its getting a bad rap. It does cook hot and you just have to learn how to cook with it. In the instructions it suggests lowering the temperature by 25 degrees and reducing the time by 10 minutes when  you use the fan settings, I use this for the regular bake setting and it works great. How can not think its good be able to cook moist, nicely browned food  in less time. \n  I like the size. You can cook anything for 2 people. It will burn food if you strictly follow recipe book. It may cook too fast\n \n  This this is really nice and \u201cfries\u201d food crisp without oil. Burned a few things by following the pamphlet instructions. Searching on line was more accurate with temp and time. Throws a lot of heat so pull it away from the wall or he a heat shield.\n \n  I had a Cuisinart toaster oven for a few years just before I got this, and I was skeptical an \"air fryer\" version would be all that different. Well I was pleasantly surprised with the results! Everything cooks faster, with a really crispy exterior. This is one of my favorite kitchen purchases in a long time.\n \n  Very easy to use just don\u2019t turn it up all the way on air fry. Took me a couple of times to get it right but now we just love  it. Crunchy fries and fried shrimp without oil. The toast feature is fine but very slow compared to a regular toaster.\n \n  Does a good job with a bit of experience. I ignore the mechanical timer, based on other reviews, and just use the stove timer or a watch. The biggest issue I have is that it runs quite hot. After burning the first thing I air fried, I put an oven thermometer in it while on bake and set to 400. The temperature cycled between about 375 and went all the way up to 450 (!). When baking or air frying, I am setting the temperature 50 degrees below recommended, and checking every 5 minutes or so. I repeated the thermometer test with an old toaster oven and the stove oven and their temperatures were much steadier.\n \n  You really need to read directions @least 2 times and adjust time according to cooking directions. Until you get familiar with the cooking power, do not leave it unattended. Burn baby burn.  I haven\u2019t had any of the problems others have complained about.  I wish it was a it easier to clean.  Dishwasher friendly would be nice.\n \n  I love to tell people about my toaster oven/air fryer. Just the fact that I can have two separate small appliances all in one blows my mind. It takes the same amount of surface space that my previous toaster oven used, so I was very happy to upgrade. Tator tots and etc crispy up perfectly and quickly. I highly recommend!\n \n  I love this! Not only does it do the standard things like toast, convection/oven bake, convection/oven broil it is also an air fryer. My first time with air frying. I'm getting used to it and have made several foodie things. I'm also on a Facebook air fryer group and have gotten many hints and recipes. I will not be giving this back! LOL.\n \n  Bought air fryer it was very fast cooking and air frying until it stoped working all together not happy with product defected I will not recommend to anyone.\n ", "\n  I have reviewed this before , when I first got this . Not only is this the WORST purchase I have EVER made on Amazon but if I could give negative stars , I would .  With a oven thermometer , I can't get this thing over 250 degrees . It barely makes toast .\n \n  Very disappointed to find that this am the unit is not working at all. It is not even 2 years old. \n  I've been searching for air fryer for awhile, \n  We needed to replace our toaster oven and this was the perfect replacement.  It is used multiple times a day and doesn't heat up the house like a conventional oven would.  We love how fast it cooks our frozen foods.  Evenly toasts as well.\n \n  Too small for most things\n \n  The unit is smaller than we thought it would be.  That is my fault, i did not measure properly prior to purchase. \n  Nice product, I use it more than my oven since we are empty nesters. Edit: I still love this oven. We use it heavily every single day and it\u2019s still going strong. Only slightly discolored on the bottom removeable tray. Front glass is still like new. This is a great product\n \n  Great appliance. Works well. Air fryer works better than air fryer \"only\" appliances. I strongly recommend this product.\n \n  dislike------received the oven and it was well packed, however, there was a mounting screw on the back cover that was inserted but not secure. Manufacturing bent a tab with the screw because they missed the hole. Poor quality that I had to take the time to repair rather than send the unit back.\n \n  This toaster oven runs so hot! It's off by 50 degrees. Burnt a pizza in 10 minutes that was suppose to take 20 minutes.\n ", "\n  We ditched our big toaster oven for this, but kept our toaster because some people said it wasn't great at making toast.  Where has this technology been all my life?  So far we've made air fryer bacon, homemade chicken tenders and \"fried\" chicken thighs.  Everything has been out-of-this-world amazing.  I've got lots more to try but so far I am super impressed.  This is worth every penny!!!! \n  In my opinion this shouldn\u2019t be listed as a toaster. In fact I gave up using it as a toaster.  I like my toast quickly browned on the outside and soft on the inside.  This dries out your toast to the consistency of a crouton. And it is so slow.  I did air fry some sweet potato fries that turned out well. I think I need to practice some more with other items.  Just don\u2019t expect it to replace \n  We originally bought another type of air fryer and hated it because it made the whole house smell like plastic and the food tasted like plastic also. Our toaster had broke also and so I was looking for a combo air fryer/toaster oven and this kept coming up in the top 5 and it has not disappointed! I love it! I'ts quiet, it cooks great once you get use to the dials. The food always comes out juice on the inside and crispy on the outside. I've made frozen buffalo wings, steak, pizza and homemade granola and it's been perfect. Toast comes out great each time and bakes great too. Love it! Did I say I love it!?\n \n  I have two of these air fryers. One for home and one for work. I was very skeptical that air dryers would make any sort of difference to food but they are so worth the money and precious counter space. I use this just about every day.\n \n  Works great! I read the negative reviews but I decided to trust the Cuisinart name! I have many great Cuisinart items. I was right! This Ivan is amazing! It does everything I need. I think some just don\u2019t follow instructions! You do have to learn what temperature you like because it\u2019s a dial not digital. But it sure does everything and clean up is a breeze!\n \n  We really like having our Airfryer/Toaster oven.  The only problem is the temperature settings, they are inaccurate.  We have to lower the setting 40-50 degrees to meet the cooking instructions.  It's like the dial is improperly placed for the temperature desired, however it cooks very well once you figure it out.\n \n  My wife was complaining against getting this because of the price tag. But I bought it anyway and she loves it as much as I do. It\u2019s pretty big, you can fit 4 large chicken breasts in it. It cooks very fast so it\u2019s not a good idea to walk away from it for long. I am also a huge fan of steaks and believe it or not this gives me the best steaks I have ever had.\n \n  This product looks nice on my counter and seems to work fine.  Cooks hot, so keep that in mind.  Also toasting and broiling take forever.\n \n  We have cooked french fries, baked brownies,  wings, breaded vegetables and are amazed at the speed and crispness of the items we made. This is a must have appliance.\n \n  Love, love, love my Cuisineart Toaster Oven Air Fryer. It makes the best toast and salmon plus it crisps frozen frys and leftovers. I've had mine for a year and I'm so happy with it that this one is for my daughters 50th birthday.\n ", "\n  Bought this for my Wife.  She loves it. We have only used it a few times and seems to work as stated. \n  Cuisinart never disappoints! We just received this oven on Wednesday evening and that same evening I air fried frozen egg rolls and they turned out perfect. \n  I am SO glad we purchased this. It has all those annoying things about toaster ovens solved, like easy to clean the bottom tray without crumbs getting caught in the door. It cooks beautifully. I was wondering how the tray fryer would compare to the turning basket style and I\u2019m sure the tray is best. We just love it.\n \n  I love the fact that food cooks quickly and there is little or no heat so my kitchen does not heat up.  Especially a good thing during \n  This air fryer is just beautiful beside my stainless appliances.  Even better, it cooks flawlessly.  It's a little small for my family with 2 teenage boys but I just let them eat when it's hot and finish mine.  I've reheated fried chicken, cooked raw chicken, made hot subs, toasted bread and reheated pizza.  It's well worth the price, but I bought it on sale!\n \n  The product stopped functioning after a little more than a year. Temperature control is approximate with the knob sliding, rather than clicking into place. Not easy to clean. But for the price paid ($189 with taxes) it shouldn\u2019t have broken down after only a year\n \n  Stopped working after a week of unboxing it. Used once a day for 10-15 mins. Bad product. Do not buy\n \n  This oven does a better job than conventional toaster ovens and it does it quicker.  If you\u2019re a fan of toasted bread, get yourself one of these.  I\u2019ve also roasted chicken and reheated leftovers in it.  I find myself using a microwave oven less.\n \n  I got this because my two daughter in laws liked theirs.  I have not had the chance to use it much yet therefore I could not answer the easy to clean question or the energy efficient question, but so far I am loving the versatility of this oven with convection, reg. bake, toaster, and air frying!!\n \n  I wanted to love this but it burns food as the temperature control are very inaccurate.  Baked biscuits at recommend temperature but almost burned them. First attempt at air frying burned the fries.  I returned it.\n ", "\n  We were skeptical at first because crispy food without cooking oil honestly sounded strange. Well, it works! I believe in paying for quality and with Cuisinart that\u2019s what you get. From the very first meal, veggies, potatoes- everything- came out great. Toaster feature and baking are a plus we didn\u2019t even expect. Highly recommended it.\n \n  I works great, but not so much for backing.  I find you have to keep the temp lower than an oven, and it backs half the time as an oven.  Unless you use the Air Fry Back and get the circulation air you do not get even cooking.  Once you learn how to use it, it works good.  Toasting works great.\n \n  I went through a LOT of reviews before purchasing this toaster oven/ convection oven/air fryer...it is everything I expected and more! I hardly ever use my conventional oven anymore. It takes a lot of getting used to, and I\u2019m still learning it because it cooks everything way faster, even on regular bake! You will never be disappointed with this! I am only cooking for 2, but there is certainly enough room to cook for 4, as we always have a ton of leftovers!\n \n  I bought this to have a better oven for our camper. The only issue is that I have to turn the item I'm baking about halfway through or it's too done on the back side. Not a big issue but obviously the temperature is hotter in the back.\n \n  Have made so many recipes: Party wings, Pork Tenderloin, Home Fries, Fish. The toaster oven is great for heating up pizza, sandwiches, bagels, etc...  It is also very stylish on my counter. I have used every cooking feature. Works great. It takes a little time to get the hang of using it, but after that, piece of cake!\n \n  Air fryer works great! There is a learning curve. EVERYTHING COOKS FASTER so monitor the progress and do not leave anything unattended.  Convection oven works well for baking ,esp for smaller batches without heating a big regular oven. Also this toaster oven can burn your hands if you don't use good oven mitt. I use a kitchen fork to pull the tray out slightly before pulling it out.\n \n  Admittedly I didn't intend to spend this much on on a mini-oven, but the air fryer is just awesome, and surprisingly  well insulated.  The pullout tray makes cleaning super easy. \n  As an air fryer and a convection oven it works GREAT. \n  We\u2019ve only airfired wings so far and it works great. For baking the temp control is not accurate and easily over cooks food. Would be much better if it were a digital controller.  For toast it works okay but not consistent between bagels and bread on light to dark setting, need to figure it out for your taste.\n \n  Everything about this is good except the oven light.  It can only be used when the oven is running and door is closed.  It would be nice to be able to turn it on when checking or turning items. ", "\n  It works great but not being dishwasher safe is kind of ridiculous now days.. Also one of the pans is starting to flake already. Not good. We followed the directions for cleaning it so it should not be talking.\n \n  We love our new toaster! Everything cooks faster and accurately. Especially when we use the air fry option. It actually cooks a lot faster than the recommended time. I was dreading cleanup but with just a rag, soap and water, it was clean! I did line the bottom tray with some aluminum foil so that I can toss sheet rather than cleaning.\n \n  I bought one of these for my mother recently after having received one as a wedding gift. I love it it. It gets the job done and it\u2019s simple enough to use. I have had no issues with either unit. The air fry functionality is really great. Can\u2019t go wrong with this one!\n \n  Is like a normal toaster, but bigger and with too many options. There is twice the option to bake, and the same happens with broil, and have no idea why. I have use it for airfrying. So far is good, but I was expecting it to be amazing!, and it is just desapointing. Also my electricity bill went to the skies.\n \n  I was a bit hesitant about buying this air fryer but I\u2019m so happy I did. So far I have cooked chicken, chops, wings and french fries. The food comes out as though I fried it and it cooks in half the time I would\u2019ve cooked it on the stove. This fryer is amazing and well worth it!!!\n \n  I had wanted to buy one of these for a long time. When my old toaster oven did not heat I decided it was time. This oven gets too hot. I cooked a pizza trying to follow instructions it was burnt so bad I could not eat it. I tried lowering temp and it is still too hot. It browns everything on the outside and the inside is raw. Wish my old oven would work. I would not recommend this oven at all.\n \n  This is a great  product. BUT you need to practice & look up how long to air fry different meats. There is a guide with all sorts of recipes, but not a simple pork chop recipe. It's  a great toaster oven & broiler. I don't use it for baking.\n \n  This appliance is larger than the air fryer we replaced with this, but it also replaced our 20 year old toaster oven. We are still learning the quirks of this machine but are overall pleased with the results.\n \n  I was so excited to get this product.  To date I have used the air fryer function and the oven function.  Both work very well.  The reason for the 3 star rating is the drip pan started rusting in multiple areas after two weeks use.  The appliance was not used everyday and the care instructions were followed.  I contacted customer service over a week ago and have received no response.  This is my last Cuisnart purchase.\n \n  This is hands down the best air fryer/toaster oven on the market. The large surface area is critical for air frying. It's also the best toaster oven I've used. It cooks a little faster than most, i usually take a few minutes off the suggested bake times. The build is solid. The door insulates better than most toaster ovens. ", "\n  very versatile but runs hot. cooks significantly faster than instructions state. once you get down the way it cooks you'll use it for practically everything you cook. (I do/did) 3 year warranty, quit on me at 1year & 3mos. good customer service. \n  I should have paid attention to the reviews. This unit\u2019s temperature control is erratic. Using an oven thermometer to verify settings I found the oven temperature exceeded the selected temperature by 50 to 125 degrees.\n \n  Burned every meal since I got it. Finally put the thermo on it once when I had it on 'warm' function. That is what is in my photos\u2014 the oven set at 'Warm', but the temp climbed to 387F. \n  I am using for any kind of food to be ready faster , more  in bake/air fryer . \n  We live in a small basement apartment.  It has no large appliances except a refrigerator.  We purchased the oven and have loved it.  We can bake almost anything.  It has excellent heat, without making the whole area hot like a normal range.  We can toast multiple slices of bread at the same time.  We use the air firer for tacos.  We are very pleased with this item.\n \n  We have had sooo much fun since getting this oven. It will blow your mind at the results of frozen pizza, salmon, potato wedges...even a simple turkey sandwich is now an unforgettable experience.\n \n  I like the air fry feature but it takes some learning.  If you go by food direction, you will find your food extra extra crispy, even burnt black.  I have learned to either reduce the temp & keep the recommended cook time or keep the recommended cook temp and reduce the cook time.\n \n  In a short time, this has become my go to small appliance.  I love that it is so versatile.  I have used it for air frying, toasting and heating up leftovers.  It's a bit larger than my old toaster over.\n \n  Love this unit, but it cooks very fast, I burnt a few items, until I got the hang of it. French Frys, chicken wings, tator tots and onion wings are great in the air fryer. Easy clean up.\n \n  These 1800 watt elements get hot fast. Watch your food so it doesn't burn. I tried the Chefman Air Fryer and it took an hour to cook a steak and fries. This thing gets R done quick! Great oven.\n ", "\n  I only needed a toaster oven but as I started investigating, I found this toaster air fryer.  I really love it and I've been experimenting with the air fryer.  I have to watch it closely because it's very hot and cooks so fast.  I really love it.\n \n  Love the fact that unlike other air dryers you can see your food cooking. Only down side is my dislike of timer. You have to guess at time set in between numbers. Starts out at 10 min with every fifth marked. Would prefer digital dials for accuracy.\n \n  I am so thankful I bought this oven. I had to experiment with different settings and temperatures but figured out how to make the food turn out to my family's taste. My oven broke right before we are moving. Because of this purchase, I don't have to buy a new oven.\n \n  My first purchase for a multi purpose toaster oven! I'm still learning how to air fry! \n  we ordered this in 2018...died in mid 2019...and got replacement..which just dies this week \n  This air fryer/toaster oven worked great for our family. Unfortunately, after just under two years, it's now dead. \n  It is an energy saver for a single person.  Cooks fast.  Safe for older person with limitations in use of hands.  With adjustments you can get good results.  I did not expect this air fryer to take the place of a deep fryer.  Pleased with its performance.\n \n  Love it! Works so great, cooks things very fast. The air fryer is wonderful, especially since we don\u2019t use much oil for our cooking. I would recommend this to everyone. We haven\u2019t owned a microwave for years and have no complaints, this totally makes up for it and then some!\n \n  Used it yesterday to reheat leftover frozen Detroit style pizza.  Set it on convection broil @ 375 for ten minutes keeping a close eye on it and it was better then the night before.  French fries were nice and crispy on the air fry.  Just got it so we are playing with it right now, it does take some learning.  Can\u2019t wait to try more things in it, won\u2019t be using the oven or microwave too much anymore.\n \n  Good but was thinking it had a bigger tray area. Same size as regular microwave. Smaller than microwaves over the stove. (For size comparison).  But works very nice. Wish I didn't have to buy a microwave separate tho.\n ", "\n  Still learning how to use the thing, but so far I have not been disappointed.  Like it and have not complaints.  So far the only substandard result; I tried to make French fries from small white potatoes using the air fryer.  Didn't work out too well.  Learn from experimenting.\n \n  This oven is a really nice addition for our kitchen.  It doesn't take up a lot of room, but it really heats and cooks well.  We found that cooking fries requires us to put the rack in the recommended slots but we turn the rack upside down or our fries get too cooked.  We really like this oven.\n \n  Very efficent uses less time to cook and we love not using alot of oil to fry foods.\n \n  I've had this now for about two months. I love everything about it! It does everything it says it does in half the time as my old convection toaster oven. Makes fries taste like restaurant prepared without the fat. I've baked, broiled,airfryed, toasted and used to keep things warm. I have zero complaints for this kitchen must have.\n \n  Love Love Love this product!  The air fryer cooks up a frozen chicken breast in about 25 minutes.  Golden brown on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Most important is clean up is so easy.  The basket and drip pan clean up with hot water and soap, no scrubbing.  Toaster function works well also, bagels toaster pastry, waffles all nicely browned.  Fits on my countertop, very little heat .\n \n  Temperature fluctuates during cooking 50 degrees. Iv'e had to reduce temperature control by 50 degrees on the dial and it still cooks food in 2/3rds of the recommended time\n \n  Takes a little while to gage what temperature to set for each food item. Frying basket can be a little tough to clean but I think that would be the case with any air-fryer product/brand. \n  need to watch it like a hawk! \n  Have been looking forward to trying this out - it arrived yesterday and today I experimented with air frying eggplant for eggplant parmesan.  Worked like a charm - the eggplant cooked up perfectly with tiny spray of olive oil and the texture is what I've been trying to achieve for years!  Looking forward to re-inventing many of my standard recipes with this healthy and convenient option.  The oven is bigger than I expected - but it's worth the space it take up...\n \n  Obsessed with this toaster air fryer. It has huge capacity and isn\u2019t too big to leave out permanently. I love that I can see what I am air frying without opening the door. It heats up faster than a regular air fryer.\n ", "\n  My  Cuisinart TOA-60 oven is wonderful!  I have air fried, baked & toasted in it daily since I purchased!  It is wonderful size for one or two people, I have enjoyed not turning on my regular oven this hot summer.\n \n  The first one sent to me was defective but UPS picked up the next day and I received one in perfect working order.  Stuff happens, right?  Nice clean look to go with stainless steel appliances and SO far I love it!  Easy to operate with good instructions included.  I like the it has an interior light so you don't have to stop cooking to check on your food. Some recipes are included in guide book\n \n  I bought this because I wanted an air fryer but didn\u2019t have the room in the kitchen for another big appliance sitting on the counter. The toaster oven / air fryer combo is perfect. It works great. The air fryer tends to cook much faster so you have to get used to it or you\u2019ll burn your food. But it works great. Love it!\n \n  I got this for my mom to replace the typical air fryer (Phillips) which had rusted and many reviews stated they did. This one is a night and day difference better all around! Much easier to use for everything including the air fryer and much easier to clean without rusting!\n \n  Baking a pizza is a breeze.  Instead of having to wait for 20 minutes as with our previous toaster oven, our pizza is done in 7 minutes (thin crust).  Other items are also ready a lot quicker using the air fryer setting.  We love it!\n \n  Air fries wings quickly. I like the fact that it replaces so many appliances and has such a small foot print.\n \n  All advertised functionality work as well or better than others I\u2019ve owned. Cuisinart generally makes very good small appliances and they do here as well. Works just as well as the pricier competition.\n \n  Love the cooking features. Use it every day. The air fry is good. Fun new feature for me. \n  Update- we\u2019ve had it for less than 6 months and all the white \u201cplastic\u201d where the bottom heating elements attach to the sides look burnt. A bit disappointed. \n  Great product,cooks large quantities, use it every day, temp and time consistent not perfectly accurate but consistent,only problem (mine is a little over a year old) the micro switch on the door went bad, I took cover off and bypassed it . It shuts off unit when you open the door. Was a pain to access there should be a cover plate at switch to allow access to replace it.\n ", "\n  I love this toaster oven! I have had an air fryer before and hated it. This feature on here is awesome. Food comes out like I fried it! Very happy with this purchase!\n \n  I have had  this for a year and it works great, I have only used the air fryer once, it is kind of messy.  The biggest disappointment is the baking tray, it looks horrible after  a couple of uses and it will not clean up and the replacement pan is $30.00!  Also, I cannot find another baking pan anywhere that will fit since it is a larger oven.\n \n  Really enjoying using this!!!  I made a Filet Mignon and shrimp last night, it was Amazing!! Won't use the grill again!  Made homemade pretzels so great!  Chicken Parmesan was perfect!  Sooooo Glad I bought this!!!\n \n  I had to return this. Something was wrong with it. It burned everything, even if it was only in for five minutes. Didn\u2019t even get to try the air fryer feature.\n \n  Bake setting in completely inaccurate. 250 degree setting will pre-heat any where from 350-400 degrees. Fan for convection bake will also run when not set to convection bake. Toast setting does not toast bread under 8 minutes, so air-fry toast. Timer is not accurate. Requires a lot of watching so food does not burn. There are hot spots so rotate food & tray while cooking.\n \n  Typical manufacturing techniques, build it cheap plastic and not care about the quality and longevity.  I've also seen many reviews with the same problem, I highly suggest to not purchase this.\n \n  I really really wanted to give it a five star.  I purchased this product 8 month ago and I loved it.  Loved it so much that 5 of my friends and colleagues bought it well.  However, the thermostat controller got stuck at high and burning the foods inside and becoming fire hazard.  So I called Cuisinart and they send me a replacement and I just had to paid minimum shipping cost.  So far so good.  However, Cuisinart is requiring me to ship the broken product back to them at my cost.  Least expensive shipping cost from Virginia to Arizona is ninety seven dollars.  Any suggestions?\n \n  The drip pan takes some scrubbing to clean.  Important to stand close by when broiling as food continues to cook when timer goes off.  I use this device every day instead of my oven and microwave.  It is well worth the counter space.\n \n  Excellent; fast cooking, great appliance.  Would recommend it as it takes the place of using your big oven.  Did a pizza in it first time.  Just remember not to over cook.\n \n  It's difficult to be precise with the dials, and they can behave a little wonky if you turn the timer back to end cooking early. ", "\n  She loves it! Toaster had died and she wanted something that would do bagels. This works great for that and so many other things. Great product. My daughter was very envious so I will be buying one for her for her birthday\n \n  I love my Cuisinart air fryer/toaster oven. This was the only game in town when it came to this type of oven, air fryer, etc. I do tend to lower the temperature recommended in air frying recipes by about 50 degrees for best, non burned results. Have fried many things in it already and I\u2019m quite pleased with my purchase\n \n  I purchased this for the lake place. Small cabin no oven.  This has yet to make it to the lake because I am loving it. No lag time warming up.. broiled raw hamburgers in 15 minutes, air fry shrimp in minutes, frozen appetizers air fry perfect. Did I say no warning up time needed.\n \n  Doesn't take up a lot of counter space and has replaced the micro. and toaster. The air frying seems to make food taste better and is way more convenient to use as well as freeing up counter space as other kitchen appliances have been eliminated.\n \n  I am very disappointed in this oven.  We purchased it in November of 2019.  Within just a few weeks the timer began to stop working consistently.  Within a few months the other controls began to stop working.  At this time I can only toast, bake and air fry and even those are very inconsistent and I have to fiddle with the knob to get it to stay on.  I have spent far less on toaster ovens that have lasted far longer.\n \n  I've been wanting to get an air fryer for a while now.  When I saw this,  I was excited to see that it had the ability to function as an oven and an air fryer.  I've only had it for a few days now but I love it!  Air fried brussel sprouts and broccoli both came out perfectly crispy.  The cooking time is super fast.  Also finished off a few t-bone steaks in it after searing in a cast iron pan.  Perfection!  It will be a time saver for sure when preparing kids' lunches in the mornings.  Looks great on the counter as well.  Love!\n \n  My wife loved the first copy we bought, and loves the one we bought to replace it when the first one died. A must have for the kitchen. Shipped quickly.\n \n  This thing is awesome for bachelors!!\n \n  Had to replace our old toaster oven. This is great as a toaster oven and convection oven, like our previous. But it also is an air fryer and it really works fantastic, for everything from chicken to fried squash, crisp and delicious without the grease!\n \n  Wish the time and temperature dials could be more exact. As quickly as this thing cooks not being able to set an exact time or temperature is unfortunate. Otherwise, I absolutely love it.\n ", "\n  I bought it 2 months ago and I use it every other day. It has cooked my food thoroughly. The knobs are plastic, so I don\u2019t put too much pressure on them. It is easy to clean and maintain.\n \n  I like the air fryer however, it's disappointing (for me)  to see it for $135 when I paid $179 for 2 of them within the last few months.  One for us, one for father in law.  Don't seem fair.  :^(\n \n  purchased 11/19. Will not use again. Went to pull plug after using air fryer, was so hot could not touch it.  fire waiting to happen...\n \n  This oven is awesome. I use it everyday. The drip tray is a little tough to clean so if you line it with foil, you will be fine. The food comes out super crispy and tender inside. I make air fry chicken and it comes out amazing. Its a no brainer to air fry. It is less smoky than my old air fryer so this is definitely an upgrade!\n \n  Product does what it\u2019s supposed to do but it\u2019s very hard to clean well. Once you cook chicken wings in it, everything you cook in it tastes like chicken. The inside top (ceiling) of the machine is hard to clean with all the burners and fans.\n \n  It definitely runs hot but I  just make adjustments in my head. Cleans easily enough; nothing is going to be completely simple, but clean often and shouldn't be a problem. I absolutely love this little oven! Things cook fast and well. I'm still learning with it, but love using it.\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster air fryer. I gave my toaster away, and am using this item all the time.  It is perfect for what i need in my kitchen.\n \n  Works great.  Easy to clean.  With the variety of settings- toast, bake, broil, and air dry you only need the one appliance.  We use it every day.\n \n  Love this oven. Airfryer is wonderful. Crispy foods without a lot of extra fat. It is a larger size than a toaster oven but not too big. Bakes, broils, toasts, and air fries all in one.\n \n  I bought it for one reason and one reason alone, to get nice french fries, but no matter what I do or any youtube tutorials I see the fries do not come out right..... very disappointing.\n ", "\n  I love not having to use our big oven for most things. I can air fry, convection oven, broil etc easily and quickly without heating up the house.\n \n  I love this item.  I already had a toaster oven and really wanted an air fryer but I did not want to purchase yet another item to lug out of the cabinet.  This is perfect as it just adds to what I am already using.  The air fryer is excellent for roasting veggies and cooking fries etc. I really love this machine!\n \n  Does not get very hot especially when you have both burners on, I tried cooking bacon on there but the pan never got hot enough so the bacon was just sitting in Grease I would not buy it again!!! Or recommend it to anyone\n \n  need better instructions on how to use.  takes up a lot of counter space.  cooks things well.  still on learning curve.\n \n  This thing is amazing.  Skeptical at first when the wife wanted a $150 toaster fryer oven thing, but this thing is sick.  Easy, quick, fry stuff!  Wings in 20 mins!\n \n  The thing is too big first of all, unless you have an acre of counter space you don't know what to do with.  Runs hot, no matter what temp or type of heat you want.  I had a pot bellied air fryer from a \"like seen on TV\" that out paces this monstrosity in no time.  If you just want a quick fix air fryer, stay away from this over designed little oven.\n \n  I couldn't rate durability after only 60 days, but is super versatile!  The fry basket is easy to clean, if you let it soak for a while (I let it soak overnight)  It would be nice to be able to put them in a dishwasher.  But that is out weighed by how well the items come out!\n \n  The oven is large because of the air fryer which can barely air fry a couple of chicken breasts because of the size for air fryer use. The dials are confusing sometimes because if you bake you use a different dial then if you toast. If you bake one night and forget to change the setting to toast the next morning you may think you are toasting your bread but you are not. It also just \"bit the dust\" after only 1 year and 8 months. Not a long enough life span for a $200 oven in my view.\n \n  Still experimenting, does everything you could expect from it. Works great for chicken, pork chops, toasting English muffins etc.\n \n  Read your manual!  LOL!! ", "\n  We live on a boat & replaced the existing oven with this. \n  The fan blows straight down on the food, even when the air fry or convection setting is off. It burns anything that will take more than about 7 minutes to cook.\n \n  Best thing I have purchased in a kitchen appliance. Replaced toaster oven and toaster. Works amazing. Many recipes used and designed for this.\n \n  it can do so much more than just an air fryer.  oven toaster  well worth the price and makes cooking easy and not heat up the whole house\n \n  I\u2019m not a great cook and this has made it so easy to look like one! Fast and easy. Small enough to sit on my microwave and under the cabinet.\n \n  The packaging was A+, there was no way this thing could get damaged in transit. \n  Works great on every setting. Love my crispy vegies.\n \n  Where has this been all my life?  My family loves the food that we cook in here.  I\u2019m just learning but  finding lots of fun and easy recipes!  I highly recommend this product!\n \n  So far, so good. Burnt my first piece of toast on medium. We are enjoying it for garlic bread, breakfast sandwiches, etc. Also made some decent sweet potato fries.\n \n  I like this oven!  It works great although I used it with the tray twice and it is ruined :-(. Wish the tray lasted pinger but it\u2019s got brown stains all over it.\n ", "\n  I wish I had returned this oven.  It cooks hotter than the control indicates.  The timer is off. It is small inside and the only thing it does well is toast.  I have an $8 toaster that can do that.  Baking is awful.  Air frying chicken according to directions resulted in burned exterior and raw interior.  My Breville convection works better.\n \n  I shouldn't love a small appliance this much.  It makes perfect wings, crispy bacon, and twice baked potatoes and reheats pasta and pizza expertly.  Everything we put in comes out amazing.  And, it took the place of a toaster oven and bulky air fryer, neither of which worked as well or as fast as this multi-tasking wonder.  If space is at a premium in your kitchen and you don't have tons of time to wait for toast, you need this.\n \n  This is the best money I have ever spent. This little appliance heats up extremely fast and cooks thing evenly. The airfryer setting is amazing. If you like pizza rolls, 7 minutes, crispy and delicious! You can bake a whole frozen pizza in half the time!\n \n  I bought it because it promised a higher capacity than my egg-shaped air fryer. It delivered. \n  The drip tray is made of inferior material and extremely difficult to clean. Directions say no dishwasher, no abrasive scrubber but NOTHING gets the tray clean after 10 min of backbreaking scrubbing and AFTER 30 min of soaking. I don't have time for that! I am VERY disappointed in the tray quality especially when you have to use the tray each and every time. It makes me wonder what else is sub quality.  I like the oven but if I knew then what I knew now, I would NOT buy this product.\n \n  Great little oven! The temp does run about 40 to 50 degrees hotter than advertised.Love the airfry option! It makes the best fries!\n \n  This was a gift for my daughter and son in law.  They love it and use it regularly.  It's a good size which is what they wanted as some air fryers are very small in volume.\n \n  I love it that this oven has 4 different features; It toasts, it bakes, It has a confection bake, And air fry\n \n  This is one of my favorite appliances. It bakes great & its air frying Is awesome. We use it most of the time now. Our regular oven rarely gets used.\n \n  Love the idea of healthy air frying, tried that setting a couple of times and the food had a good crisp to it. ", "\n  Her previous oven quit, so we got her this one. \n  I love this oven.  It toasts very well and the air fryer features crisps French fries up perfectly.  I need to become better acquainted with the baking aspect of this oven so I can't comment on that.\n \n  Great air frier/convection.  Heat distribution is much more even than other fan-driven convection ovens we've owned in the past.\n None None None \n  \u00a0The noise is pretty intense. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a defect.\n \n  Temperature dials are hard to control, as there isn't any accuracy.  Either everything is under cooked, or burned.  Have not attempted the air fryer mode because of this. \n  I bought this for my tiny house. It's a perfect size and serves multiple functions making it ideal. The only thing I don't care about is cleaning the bottom. The heating units are in the way. \n  I wanted an air fryer but didn't want another item on my counter top and did not want to live without a toaster oven. This thing combines all those items. Love it.\n \n  Game changer for sure!  I am not a \u201ckitchen gadget\u201d person but this thing toasts, bakes, AND it\u2019s an air fryer.  It\u2019s not Gawd awful looking and it doesn\u2019t take up too much space.  I\u2019m very pleased with it!\n \n  First, this product is made in China. The air fryer seems to work ok, but the accessories are very poor quality. They are really hard to clean. It makes it difficult because the food gets so stuck in the accessories that it gives off a burnt smell and you have to keep on cleaning it up so you can re-use it. Otherwise the kitchen will smell burnt as well as the food. We are stopping to buy any more Cuisinart items after this experience.\n \n  Way more convenient and functional than the dedicated air fryer we own. Cooking much faster as well. A frozen pizza that previously cooked in 15 minutes now only takes 8.\n ", "\n  I requested this for Christmas, and finally got it in March. So far I've used it to toast bagels and warm up left-overs. (I'm a simple girl) It heats quickly (bagels were darker than I normally like) and I cant wait to use it for more complex meal prep. Most excited about the air fryer function.\n \n  This little oven is perfect!  If you are on the fence, get off and get it!!!  You will find the air fry function is better than an actual air fryer since you have a larger capacity than most.  If you want to bake in the summer and not turn on your big oven, this is perfect!  You can cook in half the time of a traditional oven and not heat up your home.  This would also be a must for that RV when you want a compact go-to cooker!\n \n  I honestly haven\u2019t used the air fryer as much yet, but overall, I really love this. It makes leftover pizza crispy and delicious! We use this multiple times a day, and it\u2019s nice having so many baking options in one.\n \n  I love it, works very well\n \n  The airfryer portion of this oven is great, but when toasting, or baking, it will burn the food almost everytime. I even lower the temperature 25-50 degrees, and food is always overcooked or burned in no time.  I also do not like the fact that it is so small width wise, as you cannot use any other trays in this oven, it would be better if it was wider, although it doesnt matter as I don't think I'll continue to use it.  It just gets too hot!\n \n  Love how the air fryer works so well.  Working on figuring out toast, but we are mostly using air fryer.  It is cutting down on getting fast food.\n \n  I was so excited to get this, but now wish I had waited and read a few more reviews.  If I try to back on anything over 325 it burns.  The drip tray pan discolored so quickly after just a few uses.\n \n  Not as expected.  Instructions vague.  Would not purchase again or recommend anyone else to do so.  Would have been nice to have recipes included with item.\n \n  Seems do do everything well even toast is perfect. I only one thing you have to be careful about is that it does cook things a little faster that what air fryer recipes call for so you may need to adjust the heat a little lower or just keep a eye on things until you get use to it.\n \n  I am very pleased with this oven. Great buy I could not ", "\n  Very useful and fast but you have to be careful because it can burn food easily. Now I know how to use it I keep temperature low and change sides halfway.\n \n  I use it at least once every day. The air fryer is wonderful; it cooks meat in a fraction of the time it took in my oven, and if timed properly, does not dry it out. I love this appliance, which also makes great toast.\n \n  very pleased with this product. I love how I can can fry my fish, lumpia with only a spray of oil. I love how my pork lechon kawali turned out. It was easy, crunchy and yummy. I even posted it on FB.\n \n  Son wanted an air fryer but this does it all.  I would highly recommend this over the junk they sell at Wal-Mart or TV ads. He doesn't use his oven that much any more.  Real quality and it looks great.\n \n  I live alone and this oven saves me from having to use my regular oven to cook small meal. Also like that it is also a toaster, convection oven and airfryer\n \n  Oh i love this oven. It\u2019s not too large for my counter.  All the choices of cooking is awesome.  My daughter had so I came home & ordered also. On sale great buy.\n \n  This is one of the best purchases we have ever made in appliances. Very convenient and extremely versatile.  We have several friends who have asked where we got it so they can but on.\n \n  This a great compliment to our kitchen. It does it all.  Air frying and conventional cooking is very quite. We love it.\n \n  I love this product. It replaced my toaster and air fryer. You can do almost anything in it without heating up your whole house. I use it daily. \n  Been using the Cuisinart TOA-60 Air Fryer Toaster Oven every day since purchased. loved it.  will get another for mother in law.\n ", "\n  Read all of the reviews prior to purchase and LOVE this oven!  Cooks foods evenly and is such a convenience.  Need to watch food and adjust temperatures at first, to learn how it cooks.  Air fryer is awesome.  Purchased the liner as well and placed it in the larger pan (not on the bottom of the oven) and it catches crumbs/oils very well and is easy to clean.  Love it!\n \n  This oven is 150 degrees off.  Used a thermometer to check as everything I put in it burned.  I am soooo disappointed.  Would send back if I had the box.\n \n  The air fryer function is my favorite feature!  Bought this to upgrade my older toaster oven.  Takes up a little lr less counter space but I am already using it more. Cleanup has been a breeze, too.  Love it!\n \n  I love the fact that it combines a toaster, oven and air fryer in one appliance. I freed up counter space! \n  This is one of the best purchases we've made this year.  The Airfryer works perfect, making anything you airfry to perfect crispiness\n \n  Was pleased with the look of this appliance & while it has taken a bit of getting used to the temperature settings, it is working out very well. \n  What I dislike like about the product is ! The Dip / Bake Pan is horrible. They scorch very easly and are diffcult to clean . \n  Bakes stuff great, very fast. Knobs broke though. I would expect that from a cheap Chinese piece of junk, but not Cuisinart. I emailed Cusinart several times, no response. I wish it was made better.\n \n  I use this everyday. I roast veggies almost everyday, and I went from 30 minutes in the oven to about 7 in this toaster oven. The air fryer feature - well - disappointed. I think it's hype. Seems like nothing more than the convection bake feature, and the results aren't all that great. Other than that - I'm happy!\n \n  I got a super deal on this buying from Amazon warehouse. I had read several review before purchase and notice several people stated that it didn't toast top and bottom. The TOA-60 has heating elements top and bottom so if they were not getting toasted on top and bottom it was one of three things 1. The bottom element was burned out 2. They didn't have it set to toast 3. They were leaving the broiler pan in the bottom slot preventing the bottom element from toasting the bottom of the toast. I suspect in most cases it was number 3. ", "\n  I wanted an air fryer and saw an add for this device. I thought it was total kismet. Toaster, oven, convection oven, air fryer. Holy Cats! I use it every day. Tossed out the crappy toaster and never use the larger oven (or at least rarely). I am having a blast trying out air fryer recipes. I recommend it highly.  It takes up less space than a microwave and is WAY more useful. Buy one for you and one for a gift!\n \n  We loved the size especially with the controls on top not taking up limited counter space. Fit perfectly in my kitchen corner. Not hot exterior. Got a little warm in the back when air-frying or broiling but still not bad. \n  I love this oven. It cooks great and looks attractive, too. And the price makes it a great value. I cooked a whole chicken in it, which was great. It cooks pizza well, too.\n \n  This is truly the best toaster oven ever has a combination of toaster oven and air fryer it\u2019s fast heats my leftover pizza I\u2019m so happy I found this my daughter had one we couldn\u2019t find them in the stores gotta love Amazon !!!\n \n  I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase. My goal was to eliminate a microwave from my kitchen and still be able to warm up leftovers. It takes a little longer for obvious reasons, but stays warm longer and food tastes better. The additional features like air fry have proved to be a great bonus for doing wings!\n \n  When my air fryer died, I got this as a replacement. it's not as Good as an air fryer, but different. Gets the job done.\n \n  it has almost everything you need on the kitchen, so easy and comfortable, saves so much time on mornings to do breakfasts, and air fryer its awsome, definitely recomending.\n \n  The rack, pan and air baset are not dishwasher safe and I wonder why as they are metal. It makes things less convenient.\n \n  I rate these product  3 stars because this product stop working after 1 1/2 years. I was very disappoint that I was no able to use it anymore. I love Cuisinart produce, but I not sure that I will by this product again. Thanks!\n \n  I like everything about it it makes tater tot\u2019s in three minutes! And a hotdog in three minutes also you will love it\n ", "\n  This is a THE BEST toaster/air fryer!!!! It makes perfect toast in the toaster and amazing buffalo wings in the air fryer!! \n  Only used it a few times, so far so good.\n \n  I like this air fryer - however the plan that goes under the basket is not made well. I\u2019ve called once and had it replaced because the top coating began Coming off in spots. That was after we had it for about 6 months I guess / now I need to call and get another or find something else bc the pan is doing the same thing. \ud83d\ude1e\n \n  We bought this for brother and sister-in-law who use to own a restaurant.  They love to cook!  We visited them for vacation for a month and we have never eaten better!  They absolutely love it!\n \n  Why heat the whole oven???  Nope, love using this.  It is fast, easy to clean - saves energy!!!  Love it!!\n \n  I bought this product for my rv and love how it cooks everything from sweet potato fries & Grill vegetables. I use it for meats fish, chicken and steak comes out juicy and not dry. I purchase this for the house. It was on sale thank you Amazon. Fast shipping wow!!!\n \n  Learing to use air fryer it's a great addition.  I like to put foil this says no so the pan stains which I hate but it does the job.\n \n  Perfect\n \n  Excellent product. I made toast in the Air frye oven and the toast came out great. The toaster oven is perfect size.\n \n  I love this kitchen appliance! It saves energy over my large oven and reduces the amount of heat in my kitchen. The fact that it is multifunctional is key. I can\u2019t comment on durability yet as I have only had it a couple of months\n ", "\n  I absolutely love this.  It is so versatile. We use it 5 - 8 times per week.  We have used all of the features but probably the air fryer the most frequently.  I put my toaster away and use this instead and it works wonderful.  It is large enough for us to make our entire meal in at at one time.  I have since purchased one for my mother for mother's day and both of my siblings have also purchased one.\n \n  We like this Convection Oven-Toaster-Grill-Air Fryer because  was designed and manufactured like It was created by myself.\n \n  I love this oven. I always look to buy Cuisinart. It is a great brand. I have wanted an air fryer for a while but was turned off by their single use. This one does so much more and looks good on the counter.\n \n  It will crisp your leftover chicken (fish etc) in just a few minutes. I had a regular air fryer but when my counter top oven went out we replaced it with a air fryer oven.  I like it even better. Would not want to be without it. Just watch your food until you get use to it, it cooks so fast.\n \n  Great except drip catch pan doesn\u2019t come clean. After a few uses it was stained and looks gross. I feel like it should be easier to clean without using harsh chemicals or steel wool!\n \n  Works better than we expected! Our old toaster/oven has been donated! Lots of new receipts to try1\n \n  Temperatures are uneven, some things burn, the toast setting is highly unpredictable, the air fryer and convection functions almost always burn the food. Very, very poor. Do not recommend buying it at all.\n \n  I like that you can fry meat without the smell of fried food in the house. Fish frying not as successful\n \n  Works perfectly, adjusted the heat a little lower than what recipes call for on advice from other reviewers and haven't been disappointed! Made wings that are crispy as deep fried but without the oil, breaded pork chops came out as though pan fried, definitely a great purchase.\n \n  Works just as the description says. Food cooks quickly and baked potatoes come out  with crispy skins and perfectly done on the inside. Air fryer cooks food as crispy as deep fat fried without the greese.\n ", "\n  Very happy with everything just wish there was a pull out for the bottom under the heating element for easier cleaning the bottom, other than that it is great and good proce\n \n  This is a great all in one gadget, bought it to replace air fryer and and toaster oven. Its temperature settings are hard to get right, and is almost as good as a stand alone air fyer.\n \n  A versatile appliance for a small family. The timer and temperature control are not accurate so I am using an additional timer on a lower temperature than the instruction.\n \n  Bought in may last year, having issues with it working with dual. On hold forever with customer service\n \n  I am still learning this new way of cooking. It cooks so much faster so you really have to watch for burning. It is great for meals for one or two people. Absolutely wonderful in making fried potatoes, roasted vegetables  and fish. You can roast the whole meal at the same time. I have not tried baking yet.\n \n  Product is great. Everyone in my family is loving it. \n  We love this!  We hardly ever use our regular stove.  With all the cooking options it\u2019s great.\n \n  As expected from the brand, this will not disappoint. Great product for a multitude of reasons. Highly recommended.\n \n  I never used it as it was huge. I checked the dimensions for where it was supposed to go and it fit, but it was just way too big.\n \n  Very efficient product. Was surprised after my first trial at how crispy and moist my chicken turned out. My entire family love this product.\n ", "\n  Had I known about this Cuisinart air fryer a long time ago, we would have purchased it then.  This is an amazing addition to our kitchen and it\u2019s used several days a week.  Even our grandkids use it.\n \n  Love this thing I feel like now that we have it , we use it for everything ... fits great on the counters ... I mean could be a bit bigger but it\u2019s great for the prices and cooks amazingly\n \n  Love this!!!!! Adjust temperature down a little from normal oven and less time to cook. Have used it for many items and have absolutely no regrets. Already recommended this to many friends. Discarded old toaster oven and toaster.\n \n  My first air fryer and I have successfully used this feature, enjoying good results.  Using without the convection has been more of a challenge as it still seems to take less time to bake items, which in the end is good, I just have to keep an eye on items so as to not over do.\n \n  Love this thing!! Haven\u2019t turned on oven since we our purchased! You can make everything in here at a fraction of time then your hot regular oven !!\n \n  Purchased March 2018 love it! \n  It is very hard to clean, and it burns things. It is big, but that is about it. At least it is strong\n \n  Poor temperature control. Hard to cook without burning. Returned this and bought a Breville oven that works perfectly.\n \n  Cooks really quickly and gets to temperature fast. Used it for baking,frying,and toast. \n  To make it short I love everything about this Convection Toaster/ Air Fryer. So versatile!\n ", "\n  Timer knob broke after four months of using it.  Temperature is not right - food is always over cooked. Very disappointed with overall quality.\n \n  I love all the convenient features, bought it primarily for the air fryer. Best small appliance ever.\n \n  Wanted to learn more about air frying and do love what it does for healthy food choices.\n \n  I absolutely love this appliance!  I\u2019d like to know how much I\u2019m saving by not using the oven as often AND how much time I\u2019m saving by not waiting for the oven to heat up!  We\u2019ve cooked chicken wings (air fryer), pizza and burritos (both convection oven).  I would highly recommend this product and I\u2019m not Typically a \u201cgadget\u201d kitchen appliance person.\n \n  The size is a bit too bulky. I like that it\u2019s easy to use, and has the toaster feature, so I can get rid of my toaster. My teens have been using the air fryer and it\u2019s so easy to use.\n \n  I like the fact  chicken taste like grilled out doors. also I heat my left over pizza and that without using the large oven, I dont like the micro wave reheating, this is so much better\n \n  I really like the convenience, fast cooking, the air fryer. Food I have cooked in it has turned out great and it cooks fast. The only thing I have found to be a problem is I need to turn down the temperature 25 or 50 degrees because it cools hotter than an regular oven, but I am learning to adjust that for the food I am cooking.\n \n  It cooks quick and pretty good. Keep in mind the timing they say are suggested not exact so first few times you should watch your food while you get timing down. I have seen what people about the timer knob it\u2019s flaky I have had to tap it a few times and I have only had it a week. The only thing I will say is bad is it smokes out my apartment pretty bad. That shouldn\u2019t happen I emailed the company to see if this is Defective but no answer yet\n \n  I\u2019m cooking everything differently because of this gem! It\u2019s so simple to use and cooks so many different ways- it\u2019s a bit big, but I like that because so is my family:)\n \n  We use this toaster oven and air fryer atleast once a day. Fits well under my countertop. Looks nice and cooks great. I bought it in addition to my smaller air fryer and wanted to eliminate having so many small appliances. The air fry works great, the basket is nice and big. I can cook 20 wings at once too!\n ", "\n  This is a great product. Air fryer kicks butt. The oven and toaster also is amazing.\n \n  I have a small kitchen and this has a small footprint. I love not having to use multiple appliances. I wish it had a digital timer but otherwise I like it.\n \n  I haven\u2019t used this extensively but what I used I loved.  Art fryer is great!  Oven/toaster has a good size, can take larger pans than a regular toaster oven.  Wish the trays and baskets were dishwasher compatible.\n \n  This was worth all the trouble it took to find this as a Christmas present for my wife.  This is easily the most versatile countertop cooking device I have ever used\n \n  It takes some adjustment, but that various ways to bake is most convenient\n \n  Worked perfectly for exactly 1 year...I used it everyday BUT after the year the heating element went. Cuisinart was more than happy to replace it if I shipped it back to them and sent a check for $10. So they could send me a new one. Happily I went to thr post office to find it would cost me $78.40 to send back! So that's $88.40 for something that shouldn't have went in the first place.....needless to say I have it in the trunk of my car.\n \n  Works good you have to keep close tabs on the food your cooking. You can not use the cook time from packages cooks food a lot faster.\n \n  Does all it claims to do in an impressively fast manner.  The thing is well built and once you get used to how fast it cooks does a great job.  I have been using it for everything from chicken, fish, potatoes, veggies and it does a great and speedy job.\n \n  EXCEPT for one huge flaw, this is a very useful kitchen equipment: but IT HEATS UP the WHOLE EQUIPMENT. So, DO NOT TOUCH the knobs or any part with your hands when in use. ALWAYS USE HEAT RESISTANT GLOVES. Other than this, which should really be corrected by Cuisinart, this could replace your toaster, fryer, etc.\n \n  works well, have not used it to much yet but it crisps up my potatoes real nice.\n ", "\n  Works beautifully. I agree with the other reviews that say to use a much lower temperature than the recipe book says. It cooks so very quickly.\n \n  I was pleased when I got this, but the first thing that happened was one of the knobs broke off...  I am looking for a replacement knob but can't find one.  The oven works as advertised, but I have to use a screwdriver to turn on the timer...  It is better than my 10 year old toaster oven, but not much...  Not worth the money....\n \n  It was great at first but now it does not come on at all, like the knob is sprung. What to do for repair? I do not want to spend $ for shipping, somewhere locally maybe?\n \n  Love this... I don\u2019t have to heat my big oven up to bake one or two potatoes! \n  Great oven\n \n  My Cuisinarts tend to last about 8 years. I tried a different brand last time that lasted only 2, so I went back to this tried and true brand. It was the first time I bought one with the air fryer feature. It is great! It heats up fast, and leftovers taste fresh! It bakes a little faster than I am used to, but it is a great all in one oven!\n \n  I LOVE this oven! I have told so many of my friends who have also purchased this and LOVE it! I love the layout and you can fit a lot in it and the air fryer is SO fast! I went from 2 down to on appliance and this does the job of several!\n \n  Great quality overall. Simple easy to learn controls. Does not take up too much space. Even toasting. Quick heating. Just need to get used to the temperature settings for air frying.\n \n  This air fryer is over 100 degrees off and fluctuations above and below the set temp wildly.\n \n  This is just the right size and is so versatile!!  Would definitely recommend.\n ", "\n  I had to purchase this as a replacement for the first one. It lasted less than a year and although warranty applies, it is costly to return\n \n  Air fryer only crisps the tops of anything I have tried. Toaster is not accurate. Broiler takes forever to heat up.\n \n  Maybe it's me or maybe it's the machine, but I'm not thrilled by it's performance.  Most times, it shuts off while cooking and I have to wait for it to decide to come back on.  It will come back on after about 5-10 minutes - the food isn't coming out properly cooked because of this. \n  Analog temperature controls a plus as low vision doesn't allow hubby to see digital display. \n  Works as expected.  Love this product. I had bought the emerail was not happy. This cooks evenly\n \n  This unit worked 2x and then doesnt work.  Have a Cuisinart slow cooker that is fabulous!  Would have hoped this oven would have had same quality.  Will exchange and see if the replacement works.  More to follow.\n \n  As others recently have observed.  This oven is defective with a very loud banging noise as if the fan is hitting the metal exterior.\n \n  I use this toaster oven almost daily.  The oven works extremely well and is accurate as far as temperature. \n  Compact size, wish was lil bigger. \n  Temperatures are way off during baking, still trying to figure out how to make store bought cookie dough without burning the outside and having raw dough centers\n ", "\n  I bought this air fryer oven for several relatives and one for myself for Christmas.  THe biggest problem with this is that the air fryer basket is VERY hard to clean.  Can someone tell me what non-stick baking basket and sheets will fit in this oven?\n \n  I really do like this machine I wish the dials were easier to read maybe digital, but I knew that before I purchased.  The machine does what it professes to do.  Would recommend this product\n \n  Probably one of the best things I\u2019ve ever bought on Amazon, if you are on the fence about buying this go for it it is worth every single penny !\n \n  Had another brand for the first time stopped working in a year did some research and got this one and we love it out side dose not get hot at all very friendly user.\n \n  We love this toaster/oven/air fryer combo.  We use the air fryer more frequently than expected.  Nice addition to our kitchen and baking needs.\n \n  This is a beast! It is very well worth the price. The door closes tight and doesn't jiggle, the food cooks evenly and quickly, and it looks great on the counter top.\n \n  Works great as toaster and air fryer, have not baked in it yet. We use the toast feature most often.\n \n  Powerful performance on the countertop with very little residual heat.  Our regular oven heats up the whole kitchen and family room, so during hot summer months there were oven cooked meals we avoided.  More quick and efficient way to heat up and brown frozen foods.\n \n  This thing is pretty sweet. Lots of options out there for a toaster oven/oven/air fryer/broiler. This one does exactly what I need it to do. It's kinda big tho\n \n  I absolutely love this item. It is worth every dollar I spent to make the purchase. Bacon air fried in this oven is better than stove top. No grease and it is so crispy.\n ", "\n  Love this air fryer!  Great quality.  Healthier food.  Easy to use.  Haven't received an electric bill yet so not sure on the efficiency piece.  Would recommend!\n \n  The airfrying feature dries food out too much for my liking, but the oven itself does a wonderful job cooking food evenly and quickly.  Seems very sturdy and I expect it to last a long time. The oven door feels quality and is satisfying to open and close.\n \n  The appliance I originally bought to air fry was just too bothersome for me.  This one is easy--just put the food in, set the timer, and let it go.  I'm happy.\n \n  I try to stay away kitchen gadgets because they always end up not getting used. When our toaster went I seen this and pulled the trigger. The air fryer is great. My teenagers can make stuff themselves in it. And you can make those frozen things you buy come out nice and crispy. It's fast to. Isn't as good as fried but it's close enough. Months later we still use it mutpile times a day\n \n  Perfect results if you know haw to cook...if not, you will learn fast.\n \n  LOVE THIS AIRFYER! I have used three different kinds and this is by far the best one!\n \n  I did chicken thighs for my first meal in it and they were very good - didn't have anything in the book to guide me but used the chicken tender guidelines and added more time.  Cleanup was not my favorite part but not too bad.  I would recommend this to people looking for a second oven to use.  So far it has been worth the money\n \n  I really wish I had bought this a long time ago.  The Air Fryer food is cooked within minutes, and all of that oil just sits at the bottom of the pan not on my plate.  It took a little adjusting to the temps but finally got the settings down.  I would buy this as a gift for my parents.  LOVE IT!!\n \n  We love this Cuisinart TOA-60.  We use it almost every day.  We have toasted, baked, convection-baked, air-fried, and broiled.  Our steaks were excellent with the air-frying.\n \n  I love this oven. Well I did, until it gave up the ghost a couple days ago. Just about 3 weeks shy of a year. I will try customer care and see you how they handle it for a further review.\n ", "\n  Just what I was looking for.  Just wish it was a little bigger to hold a 9x13 pan.\n \n  Works great. Love the toast feature for bread and bagels. The timer knob takes a little getting used to. Just watch your food to ensure it doesn\u2019t overcook. Once you become familiar it works great!\n \n  Quite possibly the best air fryer ever! Big enough to handle a dinner for 6! Easy controls for a small learning curve, large basket for cooking multiple items, and it looks great next to other kitchen appliances. \n  Best kitchen gadget I\u2019ve ever own. I use it everyday, several \n  I love this \"do all\" oven!! It does everything I need. I air fry, bake, toast etc.  It does heat up very hot... I always start out 25\u00b0 lower than what any directions say; keep an eye until you get a feel for it. I highly recommend. \n  Head cook only wishes it was big enough to take a 9x11 cake pan. \n  My stove gave up and died, so no more than I use one decided to just try this.  It has served me well, and since I don\u2019t cook much any more, I think it will be perfect for me.  I can cook cornbread, pizza, toast, muffins, and one layer cake perfectly.\n \n  Thanks for fast shipment cant wait to try this out, first item will be the donut recipe included in the cookbook included with this fryer.\n \n  Hands down the most used kitchen item we use. It cooks everything quickly and has given better taste to a variety of foods.  Well worth the money!!\n \n  Have used this a few times does ok but now the oven timer (farthest to the left knob) had stopped ticking, will not count down.  Not impressed with the Cuisinart name after this simple failure.\n ", "\n  Love not having to heat my big oven for small items. Quite compact.\n \n  I love this! Everything I have tried to air fry is better this way. I cannot say enough good things. I will be buying more of these for storage after this one breaks. Nothing that works this well gets manufactured for long!\n \n  Life changing oven.  No joke. Totally worth it.  You can make pizzas in 10 minutes. We\u2019ve done tempura and French fries.  I love this thing!  I have a nice kitchen with a regular, nice oven but use this one more because it is faster.\n \n  We didn't use it because our mini baking sheet wouldn't fit.  I wasn't going down to a macro baking sheet.\n \n  The best thing I ever bought! Very reliable! Very good cooking options\n \n  The air fryer feature is nice, as well as bake, broil or toast. This little oven can do it all.\n \n  Very easy to use, cooks food quickly and good. Love the convenience easy to clean. Doesn't heat up the kitchen.\n \n  I've used this item a few times now and I love it  got rid of 2 electronics (toaster oven and air fryer )for this one. The oven gets hot quick and stays hot! Watch the food so it doesn't over cook or brown too easily.\n \n  OMG, I love it! Every thing gets done quickly and tastes great. I can see through the window, so I\u2019m able to control everthing\n \n  Love this toaster oven! ", "\n  Very poor temp control calibration. I am finallgeetingbthe hang of setting for 250\u00b0, when 350-375 is the suggested temp.\n \n  Easy setup and I am agreeing with some other review concerning how quickly it warms and toasts. I think it is a matter a well working machine versus the poorly functioning devices we replaced with the Cuisinart. \n  It does everything. Bakes, fries,toasts, and more.\n \n  Love love love. I Cook everything in this thing. Fish, bake potatoes, fries, mozzarella sticks. Everything is great. Thinking about buying another as a gift.\n \n  This is by far my favorite piece of kitchen equipment.  (Seconded only by my kitchenaid mixer.) My husband wants to replace our oven with a wall unit filled with multiple Cruisinart air fryer/toaster ovens.  Ironic, considering he wasn\u2019t exactly on board with buying it in the first place.  It does run slightly hot, but it doesn\u2019t take long to get to know your AF.\n \n  It air fries my french fries (frozen) in no time.  It's fast in air frying and even fast on broiling and baking.  Haven't used the toaster part yet but I'm confident that if the other processes are quick the toaster will be too!  Cuisanart you have done great on this appliance.  Thank you!  And thank you Amazon for the great price on the item.\n \n  I live in a small studio that does not have a full sized oven... as someone who loves to cook, this mini oven is a godsend. I use it every day. Easy to clean, easy to use, and the convection oven option cuts down on cooking time by a lot.\n \n  I have only used toast/ bake and it works FAST/ you have to be careful not to burn things. But its really great that it is so fast.\n \n  Wings in 20 mins... What else do you want to know? Replaced my small toaster oven for this one and now I have a toaster and air fryer in one\n \n  I\u2019m enjoying this product - still learning how to use it somewhat but very satisfied so far. I especially like the air frying capability. I\u2019ve  done air fried chicken and salmon so far which was absolutely delicious and I can\u2019t wait to try other things.\n ", "\n  I am so pleased with this purchase. I really enjoy the airfryer feature. I am loving it.\n \n  i love this and i use it every day , I just wish it came with extra drip pans but i can order one myself\n \n  The temperature control is positively awful. We have to play a guessing game with an external thermometer for about 30 minutes before using the device. For example, the dial reads 300 but the thermometer we have reads 425. It is very pleasant looking and we had high hopes for the machine but we are quite disappointed.\n \n  I used this twice and did not have good luck with getting the food done inside the outside was brown and cripsy but the inside was not done and if I cooked any longer would have burnt.  Juices boiled over in the pan and was not able to get the stains out .  So return the oven.\n \n  Learning the temperature for baking, air fryer takes a little while. Love mine!\n \n  Quick cooking, without heating up the house.\n \n  great price for this versatile oven  , the only negative is the pan it comes with is not easy to clean, it should be made of differnt material, hard to clean\n \n  My niece reports she loves the oven.  She has young children and it has saved her a lot of time.  She's very happy with the gift!\n \n  Got this as a present for my parents and they absolutely have loved it and use it so frequently. The quality, the results, and multi-use options of it are out of the park! Worth every penny in my opion. \n  I love my toaster oven it works great. Baking is great teduce the amount of time.\n ", "\n  For those of you who have issues with the timer knob being difficult to rest to zero or breaking when you try to reset, there is an easy solution. When you open the door, the power goes off but the mechanical timer continues to run. So just leave the door open after you remove your recipe and let the timer run down the remaining time.\n \n  timer quit working 2 weeks after I got it. Eventually the timer stuck in the on mode and wouldn\u2019t turn off until I unplugged it. $200.00 down the drain. I had to throw it away.\n \n  Works great. Little bulky. But saves you from having to get/keep multiple machines.\n \n  Great air fryer oven. Good price. Cooks very fast and food is crunchy\n \n  I don't know what the trays are made of & used aluminum foil to cover them when baking. Still, no matter what I used-stainless steel cleaner, steel wool, etc. I couldn't get the few spots off the tray or bottom. I expect they will continue to get more spotted with use,\n \n  So far so good.  Its big enough to cook most things.  Temp controls easy to use.\n \n  this is as good as it looks. Easy controls and food came out get. Easy for Kids to use also. 1000% worth the money.\n \n  This was our first air fryer/toaster oven that we have ever purchased and we really must say that it is amazing. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. Makes bacon in a few minutes and is really quite easy to clean up. Takes little to no time to warm up to the proper temprature and really has eased mornings for my wife and I when we are really busy and trying to get out the door.\n \n  I bought this product August 2018 and I\u2019ve had it 1 year and 2 months and it doesn\u2019t work anymore!!!  This is outrageous!!!  Not a happy camper!\n \n  This is a fantastic product! It is a great air fryer - and had many other functions too. Cooks anything inside from a tri-tip, to bacon, to toast! Everything comes out perfectly.\n ", "\n  Works great - we\u2019ve air fried a few things, and they taste good...  Where I\u2019ve found it REALLY excels is reheating pizza.  Air fry, 350 to 400 degrees, give it 5 minutes or so (keep an eye on it as different pizzas vary), and bada bing, bada boom, it\u2019s the closest taste to fresh delivery we\u2019ve found.\n \n  This is a Time saver!!! Food is tasty and cooked in little to no time\n \n  Gift for my dil and she and my son love it. ESP the air fryer part!\n \n  Use it quite a bit. Had to learn to turn down the heat & timing. I was burning everything at first.\n \n  Excellent all in one. I gave away my huge air fryer!\n \n  I\u2019ve baked, broiled and air fried in it. Love it.\n \n  Where has air frying been all my life?  I love this toaster oven and how quick it heats up and cooks everything. \n  We roast/ toast/ barbecue we have the convenience of it all on our counter top\n \n  This is my new favorite thing. We've made a cake, brownies, pizzas, all in far less time than we otherwise would. We haven't turned on the big oven since we got this.  Easy to clean.  We love it.\n \n  Just grab any random thing and throw it in there.  Comes out tasty\n ", "\n  I haven't done a lot with this yet, but it's worked great for all the things I've done.\n \n  Great while it lasted. 1 year and it\u2019s dead. No power. They will replace it BUT I have to pay shipping which is $50.00. Not happy with that.\n \n  Seems to cook hot, Have used it every week,  large enough to cook casseroles in without heating the large oven and without heating the entire house.  Need to keep an eye on your food,  it will burn it  until you get used to it.  I have had to reduce the temp and the cook time.  I  love it so far,\n \n  I live my oven. Wish I could buy extra tray for it\n \n  This is great!  So many features and options aside from air fry.  But the air fryer has saved so much time from daily cooking.  This is an attractive piece too so no need to hide it away.\n \n  I had no idea what I'd been missing continuing to use an aging countertop convection oven.  The air fryer is fantastic.  This is definitely a great convection oven.  Highly recommended.\n \n  Not happy with it at all. Nothing but a  glorified toaster. Save ur money and buy a $20 toaster at Walmart. I set the temps  Exactly as instructions said ... and never cooked right. It\u2019s going back\n \n  Just what I needed!  Replaces my toaster and allows me to cook great meals without heating up my big oven!\n \n  Bigger than expected.  Like a lot of us, I was looking to replace the larger (Japanese) Toastie from the 80s.  There are a lot of us looking to get another Toastie - no luck.  But the air fryer is great if, say, you want to make fried chicken without the health problems of frying.\n \n  After the first item I tried to cook in this oven was burned to a crisp in less then 10 minutes, I put an oven thermometer in it after it cooled down and set the temperature to bake at 350 degrees.  The oven heated to 475 degrees before the heating element cycled off. Not good.  I'm returning the oven.\n ", "\n  This is the best toaster oven I\u2019ve ever had. French fries, onion rings, pizza all come out first rate.  Quiet, easy to clean and the perfect size.  I haven\u2019t used my full size oven at all since I got it.\n \n  Just got it today and it came damaged in the package. Useable but I am not happy about the damage\n \n  Bought after going on vacation and my friend cooked every meal with hers....came home complaining about how we dont have one ... so bought and now I use it for practically everything!\n \n  So happy with this purchase!  So many things in one.  The air fryer.... love it! Great to minimize what's on the counter\n \n  I use this little oven / air frier / toaster... every day.  not so easy to clean but if you do a quick wipe each time after you use it... its not that bad cleaning it.\n \n  This thing does it wll and take up almost the same as a large toaster highly recommend\n \n  Loveeee this appliance! Not the easiest to clean and my pans need to be scrubbed really good from overuse but love the way it cooks every time!\n \n  easy to use and cuts down o cooking time in kitchen. don't have to heat a big oven for small items. the air fryer works  fine and is easier to clean.\n \n  I bought this to replace my old toaster oven.  I wanted an air fryer so I bought this instead of a separate appliance.  It cooks bagged, fries, nuggets etc very well.  They are crispy.  Have only cooked raw chicken and pickles once and the were ok.  I am pretty sure they will be excellent with some tweaked to the recipe.\n \n  Had this oven for a while. Love it. The temp is exactly 5-10 mins too hot. Usually 5 mins.  But love the size. Have not tried the air frying yet.\n ", "\n  This is the best kitchen appliance ever!  If you want an air fryer, this is definitely the one!  LOVE it!\n \n  so its a year I had this oven and it broke today (cant turn  it off, knob broken). I filled out warranty they will replace for $10 ok not bad, but h ave to ship the old one back???? $60.....ridiculous...never again to buy something like this from online seller....\n \n  This little guy is a game changer. Once you get one of these your normal oven becomes a thing of the past. One of the best things about it is you dont have to wait for it to preheat. You can have chicken nuggets  from freezer to plate in less than seven mines.\n \n  I don't usually rate a product until I've had it for a couple months; however I  am writing this review now. I like cooking with it, but cleaning and maintenance is entirely too much work. You cook one simple item a d it turns brown the pan I  mean, even if you are just heating something up. I know it says don't use aluminum foil,  but I  will.\n \n  It\u2019s a great product. We\u2019ve used it several times already. For all different types of food. I have yet to be disappointed.\n \n  Bought an additional cook book too add to the meals\n \n  Nice looking, compact and all functions work well. Temp and timing take some getting used to. Personally, I don't think anything electric is truly \"energy efficient\", thus only 3 stars on that section. Cleans up nicely - especially the well designed crumb catcher!\n \n  Has become one of my favorite kitchen appliance. I can toast, bake, dry fryer... a great purchase.\n \n  Finally a toaster oven that does it all!\n \n  Awesome product! I am using it almost every day. Keeps my house from heating up and is great for reducing calories! Can\u2019t believe how great a fryer it is.\n ", "\n  Air fryer feature is boss. 10 minute average for almost anything that's frozen and no more grease or oils in my food. Love it.\n \n  Prepared french fries two different times and they were nothing like fried... will keep trying but disappointed in truth after all the hype.\n \n  Just over a year and it no longer works.  Seems like a $200 toaster should last longer.\n \n  Multiple cooking systems in one! Easy to use and clean.\n \n  This was not level and would not work right out of the box.  Returned.\n \n  Very noisy and we didn\u2019t try to cook with it. The noise level was off putting so much we just packed it up and returned it. They went smoothly and it was a good try to replace an old Kitchenaid\n \n  I love everything about this oven!  Great quality, lots of options & cost effective. If you\u2019re watching calories but love fried chicken, it\u2019s the best.\n \n  We are enjoying our new toaster oven. We made fried chicken in the air fryer. It turned out moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Just like we wanted.\n \n  Counter tight and as advertised  bouthe two.  both met expectations...\n \n  Really great size for two people, easy cleanup, very flexible cooking in one small appliance.\n ", "\n  This is a wonderful product, I have made hanburgers and bacon.  Both turned out crispy and juicy!\n \n  Doesn't really air fry and oven to close to bake in.  toaster of but hard to get crumbs out of bottom\n \n  How did I live without this for so long...it's fantastic\n \n  A real beauty. Works perfect.found it on a great sale.\n \n  This is awesome. It cuts cooking time drastically and is much better than firing up the oven\n \n  Can be used for so many different foods.\n \n  This fryer works the way I'd hoped my last air fryer would! Doesn't dry out food, and takes the place of several of my kitchen items.\n \n  I cooked some chicken boy was it delicious love this machine!\n \n  Amazing... we love it. Air fryer is out of this world. Helps us significantly in the everyday cooking.\n \n  Only thing I'm not crazy about is the height of item it is only about 2 inches from my cabinets which the heat could effect the cabinets.  Honestly, I've only had the unit for couple of weeks but so far it is definitely an asset and we are content with it.\n ", "\n  what a great product, I will never use my oven or fry pan again\n \n  The timer does not work and the broiler function does not work. Covid issues occurred and missed the return window. Now out over $170 for a product that is not fully functional. \n  Researched a lot of different air fryers and ended up buying this one and am so happy I did. Very spacious and looks nice on the counter. Have used it to warm, bake, broil and air fry and works great! Basket is a little hard to clean but I am sure that is the case with any air fryer.\n \n  I gave this to may son for Christmas--he loved it!\n \n  Would not recommend this convection toaster at all. Temperature control was never consistent. After a few months the oven would shut down unexpectedly- something with the timer was faulty.\n \n  So far I really have enjoyed utilizing the oven.\n \n  Replaced our old toaster oven. Convection cuts the time in half. Love the cooking time but learning curve required due to fast cooking times with lower temps.\n \n  This is the best thing I have ever purchased. This does it all. The air fryer setting is amazing, it makes some of the best wings I've ever had. You will love it, makes everything so much easier and taste so much better\n \n  My favorite thing in my kitchen. I love using it especially the airfryer and I can watch to make sure I'm not burning anything.\n \n  This toaster oven with air fryer, is wonderful Cuisinart could have giving us a little more control on the timer, but we\u2019re very happy with our purchase.\n ", "\n  Got it for my Mom for Christmas. She is very happy with it.\n \n  My new favorite thing! I just got married and we got/bought a lot of amazing things from a vitamix to a sous vide etc but this THIS IS MY FAVORITE we use it almost every day. You can make anything in this and so quickly. If i had unlimited funds i would buy one for everyone i know.\n \n  Works great, well built, and easy to choose settings.\n \n  Easy to operate, good cooking time and cooks food great.\n \n  Love this\n \n  We replaced our toaster oven with this little guy and I instantly fell in love.  I have had other Cuisinart products, but I think this is the best one yet.  The only downside is at times it cooks things quicker than expected.  We are still getting used to this and it is acceptable.\n \n  Compact, convenient, multi talented.  I live in a tiny home and this is perfect size. Am able to move it around easily. Kicks up the cooking recipes from only a microwave and hot plate.\n \n  Easy t o use, clean lines .  To toast bread it is not accurate.\n \n  Items takes less time baking than required.  Easy to use.\n \n  Small footprint and works great!  Be careful, more powerful than my large oven!  Fries, broils, bakes etc.  A true everyday appliance!  Totally satisfied!\n ", "\n  Wasn\u2019t sure if I would like this but I really do. It makes things crispy and cooks faster\n \n  Very easy to use! Easy to clean! Helps a lot to do meals fast\n \n  We love this. Gave it to my mom for Christmas. She loves it but my teenager seems to love it more and uses it for everything!\n \n  Just received and used the air fryer!! Best fries and Gordon\u2019s Fishermen\u2019s fillets sandwich I ever had!! Clean up was extremely easy!! Can\u2019t wait to use again!\n \n  I love it. I got to remove 3 appliances off my counter. Best toast ever.\n \n  If it lasts longer than a year it would be nice the last one did not last\n \n  Love it,amazing how fast it cooks a whole frozen pizza or reheats leftovers!\n \n  I really do like the unit, saves counter space with single appliance. Looks good on counter, cooking is faster with this unit.\n \n  Turned on to make toast. The fan made a loud clicking sound. Tried again several times. Thinking that the fan blades are out of balance/damaged in transit. Returned. Thank you Amazon for the quick refund.\n \n  Very easy to use it.  Food cooks fast.  Only have used the air fryer and toaster for toasting a bagel and both worked great.\n ", "\n  Happy wife. Happy family\n \n  I love this oven.  I use it almost everyday.  I bake toast and air fry.  I am a small household so it's size is prefect.\n \n  This product runs hot on the oven portion.  Besure you drop the time or temp when using.  Still haven't tried the Airfryer.\n \n  This toaster does a lot, but does not take up too much counter space.  It cooks things perfectly.\n \n  Air fryer and cooking are great, toaster is hard to clean.\n \n  this was bought as a gift. it was delivered on time. was in great condition. and works great.\n \n  I love this little Oven, I can do a lot with it. It's easy to operate, plus it's nice to bake in this instead of heating up my big regular oven.\n \n  Is very good , easy to used , I am cooking everyday after I bought ,\n \n  Love it! We use it for so many things!\n \n  Love this oven! I make everything in it! The tempature is different so at the beginning I burnt everything but after awhile I got the hang of it and it\u2019s amazing!\n ", "\n  Works great, a little time consuming to clean but overall great product I would buy again\n \n  Very convenient. Allows me to make a healthy meal on the run. Great for people on the move that are health conscious\n \n  Easy to clean, except the very top, especially after making wings. Multi purpose. Easy to heat up food. Toasts fast!\n \n  Fantastic product. The air fryer function works great. Makes amazing chicken wings.\n \n  Much healthier way to prepare food\n \n  Works great!  Easy to use and doesn\u2019t heat up the kitchen.  Wish you could set the timer for 7 or 8 minutes since it Cook\u2019s faster. \n  This was a gift.  Recipient really likes it\n \n  I canceled the oder\n \n  I got two of these ovens both ovens the thermostat for the oven did not work. We set them to 300 degrees and they both went to over 400 one went to 475. We decided to upgrade to to the next one up and it doesn\u2019t seem to be any better. Go to Walmart and get a $60.00 toaster oven and get better results.\n \n  Temperature was off by 50 degrees high, regardless of setting.  Toaster function didn't work, small interior, couldn't even air fry chicken breasts without them touching the top electrical elements.  Returning.\n ", "\n  I've ruined 3 meals in this piece of crap when using the bake function - for example, biscuits which call for 8-11 minutes at bake 400 were completely burned on the outside in 4 minutes and undercooked inside. The temperature is clearly nowhere near accurate, which makes it unusable.\n \n  This oven seems to cook to hot . \n  We love it. It works great and it doesn't burn anything. The temperature heat up things fast and leaves everything well cooked. It's even better than what we thought.\n \n  Works really well for all the functions it has. Very fast to heat up too which I like, I hope it lasts the test of time because I just got it but so far so good!\n \n  I love my air fryer oven. It does so many things. Bakes, toasts, broils, and it is very easy to use.\n \n  I really like the healthy and efficient way this oven cooks. I can have something cooked in this air oven before I can even warm up my conventional oven.\n \n  I love this Product. I am so happy that I bought it. The toaster works very well and the air fryer is amazing! Well worth the money.\n \n  Super pleased with this!! Air fry and toaster, baking smaller items, reheating and making items crispy again has been a WIN for this appliance!\n \n  This us so to use! Does everything...we hardly use the oven any more. \n  Works great so far, only had it a week or so\n ", "\n  Great for the price\n \n  Excellent excellent excellent couldn\u2019t be a better product is everything you wanted to do last forever would definitely buy it again\n \n  I\u2019ve been looking for an air fryer for awhile. Then my toaster oven went out so it was easy to pick this one! I like it how I can airfry, bake, broil, and toast!!! I just made \u201c Fried \u201c Chicken and Jicama fries with the air fryer and it came out nice and crispy!!! I love it!!!\n \n  I can prepare frozen foods in less than 30 min using the airfryer or convection when I get home from work. Heats up very quickly.\n \n  This appliance you WILL use.  Perfect fries from frozen to crispy.  Also reheating.  This looks nice on your counter I love it\n \n  I use this every day! I love it! It is easy to clean and replaces the need for separate appliances (toaster, air fryer, toaster oven). I can cook frozen foods in half the amount of time that the traditional oven took.\n \n  Not real easy to clean so we are careful in what we try to cook in it.\n \n  I love it.i made pizza it came out so gpod \n  Bought Cuisinart brand because of reputation and was disappointed.  This oven burns everything.  Bought an oven temp to test, oven was +50 degrees.  If you want to recalc temp & cook time this oven is for you, otherwise pick another brand.\n \n  Air fryer is awesome. Burns everything on the bake settings.\n ", "\n  Love this!  I burnt a couple of foods initially until I got used to an efficient toaster oven!  I highly recommend this product and the seller!\n \n  So glad i fiund this in stock finally! Im glad i ignored the megative reviews and ordered it. Great way to make healthy snacks! Love it! Looks great on my counter too!\n \n  I love fried foods & can't lie, the Air fry is AWESOME!!! \n  I love the functions but the drip pan is already peeling the coating off of it. I wish it was made of better quality.\n \n  This was a Christmas gift and my family loves it!\n \n  easy to cook food\n \n  Very well packaged. It doesn't get hot externally. very well made. Broil a small chicken in this it is what it looks like \"little oven\"...have air-fries in 10 minutes from hard frozen. I highly recommend this oven!\n \n  it appear to be quality product, however was not able to use as of now after 9 months\n \n  I love this as both an air fryer and toaster oven. The only downside is that it is hard to really clean the ceiling of the oven after you airfry. Otherwise love it. Basket cleans really well and is a generous size. 5 lbs of fresh chicken wings in two batches.\n \n  \u2764\ufe0f it, watch your oven cooks VERY quickly. I must be near oven to watch food- always bring suggested Temp down @ least 50 degrees.\n ", "\n  I've had my air fryer for 4 months and have probably used it max 4 times.  I just went to use it this morning and it stopped working 2 minutes into cooking.  Checked the fuse, used different plugs, and nothing!!!\n \n  All I can say is We LOVE this airfryer.\n \n  I didn't think we would use this as much as we do.  I am very happy with my purchase.\n \n  This is amazing -- from my toast or muffin in the morning to french fries and shrimp for dinner it handles them all in minutes.  It is so fast that I have to keep checking to keep things from burning.\n \n  This has been a great addition to my kitchen.  It is slow as a toaster but great as an oven/ broiler.\n \n  If you try to cook at the suggested degrees the food will burn before it is cooked.  Have to lower the temp. about 30% \n  Toast burned on toast setting so I put it on oven at 350 and if I didn't get it out in 2 min it burned. Cooked a meatloaf at 325 for 60 minutes and it was totally burnt.\n \n  The interior measurements are actually smaller because of the filaments.  Cooks really fast on all settings except for toast.  The toast function, not so good\n \n  We have nearly eliminated the use of a range.  This unit does it all and very efficiently!\n \n  Wife (non-cook ) make the best wings ever! really good design, can't wait to try the convection oven feature!\n ", "\n  I love this toaster and I never use my oven anymore. Everything cooks quickly and evenly. My only dislike is cleaning the inside so I make sure to cover things with aluminum foil to avoid drips and splatter. Awesome product!\n \n  Two of the four broiler elements did not work. We did like the air fryer option and it baked well. However because we wanted a good working broiler we returned it. Got another one. Same problem. Disappointing.\n \n  Works great fast for making toast , Ill keep it\n \n  one on the best things we have purchased\n \n  I've used this product as a air fryer, broiler and toaster. \n  Like the looks....offers good variety of cooking options\n \n  We purchased this toaster oven in May 2020. Two months later it just stopped working. I do not recommend it at all! Save your money!\n \n  Love\n \n  As advertised\n \n  This oven burned everything I tried to make on every setting.  Tried reducing temp and time, nothing worked.  It would be dangerous to walk away from it when momentarily.  Returned.\n ", "\n  Just what I expected\n \n  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!!! AIR FRYER IS THE BEST ONE IVE EVER USED.  TOASTER OVEN IS PERFECT!! LOVE LOVE IT!!!\n \n  We upgraded to this toaster oven air fryer and are thrilled with it so far! It heats up quickly and cuts out cooking time by at least half compared to our previous toaster oven. It\u2019s bigger than our previous one but so worth it. So versatile and I end up using it more than my full size oven. We love it!\n \n  IS BEAUTIFUL. I RECOMMEND.\n \n  I\u2019ve only had it a week but loved it right away.\n \n  Makes fried foods super fast. Great for a quick dinner or snack. Definitely read the directions for cook times, etc.\n \n  So convenient and great you dont need oil to fry with it.\n \n  I love this product! I highly recommend purchasing this product.\n \n  Might be OK for air frying, but is useless for any baking. The temperature fluctuates wildly. Is it my one oven or is this a built-in flaw?  Don't know.  I am trying to resolve this with the Cuisinart company. Wish me luck. Meanwhile, DO NOT BUY THIS for any baking.\n \n  Temperature regulation is so bad I'm returning it.  Set at 350, it varied from 200 to 425 per my oven thermometer.  Burnt on the outside, cold in the middle.  My previous $54.99 one from Costco cooked a lot better.  Bought the Cruisinart to get away from the teflon.\n ", "\n  This really works well when you don't want to heat up the oven.\n \n  The pan discolored in the dishwasher so it must be hand washed. Tried buscuits and they burnt outside and were left gooey on inside. Air fryer worked amazing for fries but not so much for cooked breaded chicken tenders.\n \n  Love this product\n \n  This is without doubt the best toaster oven I have ever used. When you add air frying it is like icing the cake.\n \n  Love this oven, with my grandson it makes it really easy to get food ready Quick\n \n  good product\n \n  I am very pleased with the oven. It is a beautiful appliance to add to any kitchen. It has a high end look to and feel. I was truly impressed with it and would definitely recommend this product to anyone.\n \n  This is a great little machine; however I am on #3 and have been experiencing the same problem with each of them.  The machine shuts off when air frying before the timer dings.  Please fix this Cuisinart!\n \n  So quiet\n \n  I love this oven but the bottom rack is so low that it\u2019s hard to grab items off of it. It\u2019s hard to explain.  But it is a really nice toaster oven and air fryer.\n ", "\n  For CuisinartThis is not a good product.  It overcooked everything. Especially if you follow a recipes.  Not dishwasher safe. I'm disappointed and probably will not buy their products again\n \n  Barely use the oven anymore, toasts bread evenly and Broils sausages and Hamburgers like a pro. Wish i thought of it years ago. \n  I absolutely love this oven. There is a little learning curve with temp's. The first thing I had to try was fries. Was skeptical with any air fryer that it would actually be crispy. I was shocked how perfectly crisp they were. We use it for toast daily. I am so glad I got this oven. Worth every penny!\n \n  Received the oven but the air fryer pan and the manual were both missing\n \n  It's a Great Toaster Oven\n None None None \n  \u00a0I was making food for 4th of July..my friend said look at the tray..I used it just once..so I didn't know about that..I requested to replacement same item.it works good so I want same one!\n \n  Was a little hesitant in spending the money for this. It works GREAT; does what it says it will do and relatively easy to use!!\n \n  Most things burn, even after adjusting temp to lower degree.  Only thing that it does well is toast. \n  LOVE , LOVE ,  my oven, very practical , easy-to-use , I have  all in one  appliance . .\n \n  I love this oven! It\u2019s just the two of us, so I have not used our full-size oven since we got it. Love the convection feature, which makes perfect cookies and my homemade chicken pot pies.\n "]}, "/BLACK-DECKER-TO1313SBD-4-Slice-Toaster/product-review/B00GGFHH4U/ref=sxin_7?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B00GGFHH4U&cv_ct_cx=oven&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.0b606763-1c8e-4e80-9d27-664676d303fa.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source&dchild=1&keywords=oven&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B00GGFHH4U&pd_rd_r=9ced2fa1-ad75-48bd-8f84-ae3315c634b5&pd_rd_w=cDgMy&pd_rd_wg=Ca86i&pf_rd_p=9e4ba918-f6ad-4007-841c-6563d381515f&pf_rd_r=TPFMSWA0170V0ZZA0PTQ&qid=1597683407&sr=1-4-72d6bf18-a4db-4490-a794-9cd9552ac58d&tag=mashcontent-20": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["EvenToast Technology - The toaster oven interior is specially designed for even toasting of up to 4 slices of bread at a time.", "9\u201d Pizza, 4 Slices of Bread - The compact toaster oven fits nicely on the countertop, while the curved interior makes room for 9\u201d pizzas and 4 slices of bread.", "Four Functions - The stainless steel toaster oven\u2019s cooking functions include: baking, broiling, toasting, and keeping food warm.", "30-Minute Timer - The timer includes precise toast settings and stay-on functionality.", "Removable Crumb Tray - Keep the toaster oven clean with the convenient removable crumb tray.", "Dimensions: 16.4 x 11.3 x 9.4 Inches"], "Product Description": ""}, "Reviews": ["\n  This one worked great for a year. Then it caught on fire... I thought it was something I did. \n  I couldn't believe my eyes the first time, and followed the safety rules in case of fire.  So anything that would help figure out the fire went out the window too. So, I started using it again, and sure enough while watching it closely I saw a few sparks to my left at the heating element, I watched a few more seconds and the fire started again.  Maybe this was a fluke, I don't know. But I would never buy this product again.\n \n  I'm disappointed that the toast timer operates like an egg timer there is no way to turn off the toaster if your toast is done before the timer goes off.  I was replacing an older Black+Decker toaster oven and it had a button I could push down to toast and up to turn off toaster if my toast was done before the timer went off. I much prefer the older version option.\n \n  I am loving this little thing so far. I have baked a personal pan pizza and banana bread and both came out very nicely. Heats evenly. Instructions are very easy to understand and toaster oven is very easy to operate. Can't wait to do more baking with it!\n \n  Burning wire smell even after 10 cycles, I can actually see smoke coming from the side of the unit. Returning for another brand.\n \n  I LOVE this toaster oven! \n  I bought this a couple of months ago but am just writing the review. Used it less than 10 times and stopped working. Timer still works, Just no heat.  Usually don't have problems with Black and Decker.  Chalk it up as you get what you pay for.\n \n  This is a great buy.  Much, much cheaper than more high-dollar brands.  However, it gets hot on all six sides.  The handle, however, does not.  The handle stays nice and cool.  Also, I would NEVER leave this appliance unattended, plugged in, or in the hands of an inexperienced cook.  I make sure it's unplugged after every use.  And, I would never turn the lower knob to the setting labeled \"stay on.\"  So far, I've used it a dozen times, and it works well.  I've used it on broil at the ten-minute mark for ham and cheese sandwiches always watching it closely.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Dangerous defect.  Timer will get stuck when set to toast. \n  A toaster should be able to ... toast.  Set the time; press a button; presto, toast!  Not with this baby.  Not only do you have to select \"toast\" from a dial that includes bake, broil, and warm, in letters so small I thought they were scratches, but then you have to select \"toast\" from a second dial for oven temperature, and which is completely irrelevant for toasting unless you fail to select it, in which case it won't toast (it will bake).  Then if you decide your toast is ready before the toaster does, and shut the timer off by turning it all the way to the left, the toaster ... stays on ... and on ...  in \"stay on\" mode, burning not only the toast, but possibly your house.  To turn the toaster off you have to turn the dial about 3/4 of the way to the left, to a tiny marker that doesn't even say \"Off\" (that would be too easy) but is simply a circle.  I would give this toaster one star, except for the fact that it does eventually toast once you've gotten your Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and figure out how it works.\n ", "\n  Please beware -- I hooked up the toaster and started to make toast.  Once the toaster heated up it began to smoke not from toast burning but it smelled like an electric fire.  Nothing is burning on the inside.  But coming from inside the machine.  I thought maybe it was just because it was the first time I used it.  So I used 2 more times and it get worse each time I used.  Also note the toast does not toast evenly nor on both sides.\n \n  I got this toaster oven to replace a Crofton toaster oven (Aldi's house brand), where one of the rivets holding the door in place snapped off. This is a pretty good toaster oven - it heats things well, heats them evenly, and is especially good for frozen snacks like naanpanadas and pizza rolls (my wife and I once had a Cuisinart toaster oven that did a GREAT job of burning everything you put in it... except toast, for some weird reason). \n  It is now sitting outside on my patio as the timer never operated and my food caught fire.  The internal area is not big enough to actually heat food in, it may have only been okay to toast a bagel, but the timer never worked so I had to sit in front of it and watch it.  BAD PRODUCT.  Fire hazard!!\n \n  just had a fire inside toaster oven.  The automatic shut off did not work.  Toast inside burst into flames.  We had a black & decker toaster oven prior to this one and it lasted a long time.  Very disappointed in this one. Only had it less than 60 days when this happened.\n \n  This toaster is reasonably fast at making toast. Has spacious interior and cooks pretty evenly. The writing on the control panel is hard to read but once you memorize where the knobs have be for toast, bake, etc. it's ok. \n  I read the reviews before I bought this toaster oven and found mix reviews. I have had it about 4 month and it works just fine. The oven door seals and stays close well. The temperature is mostly true to what it reads. I found you just have to get to know how it my vary depending on what your cooking, which is normal even for a regular oven. I don't have much counter space so I like the size. I am not finding any major problems with this toaster oven and I would recommend it. It's also was not expensive and fit into the price range I wanted to pay. I am overall pleased with it.\n \n  This toaster oven has the worst settings I have ever encountered. It is almost impossible not to burn a simple piece of toast or bagel with this toaster oven. It also does not have a rack that can go on a lower setting so you can actually bake with this toaster oven. The only setting is elevated one for toast. I have had it less than six months and in throwing it right in the trash. I wish I could return it.\n \n  It has never caught on fire, exploded, sparked, given off strange fumes or anything else I see people on amazon complaining about. I've had it since 2017 and I use it exclusively as opposed to my oven because I live alone and cook small portions on a daily basis. It's always been consistent, cooks a variety of foods and has many settings. \n  Ordered this toaster once, and they sent it to me without the rack, trays or owner's manual. Had to spend an hour chatting with Amazon representative and had to return the entire thing, because apparently they couldn't just send me the missing parts. Got a refund, ordered the oven again. This time they included the trays, but when I turned it on, toxic burnt wire fumes started coming out from the unit. Do I really have to spend more of my time returning this piece of junk for the second time? I saw that burnt wire smell is a common complaint in other reviews (should have checked the reviews more carefully before buying), so you would think that they would discontinue this model and replace it with something that actually works. Maybe they are relying on customers who don't bother to go through return process (spend time with customer service + find a box + print a shipping label + drag this garbage to the post office) and just through it in the trash, their wallets $30 lighter.\n \n  We replaced our 10 yr old B&D toaster oven with this one and boy is it different! The first huge difference is 3 knobs to turn instead of just one button to slide down. The second, and this is the biggest one, is the amount of time it takes to toast the bread - takes Forever! And it does get hot all around it - the old one just got hot on top and warm on the sides, but this one gets Hot all around it. We will keep it though - hubby has to have his bread toasted for sandwiches or the picky ole guy won't eat it. (worse than a little kid)\n ", "\n  Ours is now 3 years old, we use it nearly everyday and it works as good as new.  Reasonably easy to keep clean, and versatile, either for making toast, or for what we do, heating and broiling things like frozen french fries or tater tots, or melting cheese onto a sandwich.  My only quibble, and hopefully the manufacture reads these comments - is that the dial for setting how dark to toast is the same as the dial for setting how long the toaster/oven is on, should be progressive so that the user has finer control over time/toast at the lower end of the scale.  Unlike a dedicated toaster, it can be hard to get it 'just right' with toast as the dial at the lower end of it's range can be persnickety - the difference on toast from 3 minutes to 4 is brown to burnt whereas at the top of the scale for say, baking something, one minute either way is not a big deal.\n \n  I got this toaster oven as a replacement for one that we had for over 10 years. I use it to make frozen snacks outside on the deck when the weather is very hot and I don't want to turn on the oven in the stove. Yes, I know it says not to be used outside. But, the whole purpose of getting it is to not heat up the house and make the A/C work harder. The first time I turned it on, I used my stove thermometer to test the temperature. It was about 25 degrees hotter than the dial indicated. I have been using it with the dial turned to a bit lower temp and it does a great job with chicken nuggets, fish sticks, and pizza rolls in the time range given. \n  I usually don\u2019t write reviews, but I felt that\u2019s it\u2019s important to warn potential buyers of how dangerous this toaster can be. Upon heating up, it starts emitting a burning plastic odor, which becomes increasingly stronger the hotter it gets. The whole unit heats up, handle and all, which will definitely singe you if you\u2019re not paying attention. Granted it did toast nicely, but I don\u2019t want to risk a visit to the burn unit every time I heat something up.\n \n  It's a good oven.  My old B&D Toaster Oven \"died\" and I needed a new one.  The old one was fine and this one seems to be the latest version of what I had and it works just as well.  I do not do anything \"fancy\".  I mostly heat up pre-packaged meals and toast sandwiches and this oven does that very well.  I have had no problems.  I have been using this for about a month.  I recommend it for anyone who wants a quick, easy way to heat meals or to broil, bake, toast, etc. their own creations.  I am very satisfied.\n \n  I apparently got a rare lemon, so this toaster never worked properly in that it wouldn't get up to temperature. After limping along for a few months I wrote the below review and reconciled myself to purchasing a replacement. Within hours Michael from Black & Decker emailed me to tell me the oven was covered by a 2-year warrant and asked to please call him. In less than 5 minutes he apologized, asked a couple of necessary questions, got my info, and had a new oven shipped to me. This is what customer service should be like!! \n  Seems to work just fine and it was a great price with free shipping. Most toaster ovens are a tin can with analog dials and elements. They usually last about 3-5 years and then the element goes out and a new one needs to be purchased. Most toaster ovens are pretty hard to clean and start to look pretty bad after a few years. For the price, this one is about as good as any. I don't have much cupboard space so the size of this one is just about right.\n \n  Put food in, turned it on Bake, walked away, 6 minutes later my entire downstairs smells like burning plastic or something.  Unacceptable. \n  This is a very crapy toaster over. Do not buy this!  I bought it to replace the great Black & Decker toaster over I had since the 90s that was great. \n  This little toaster over has everything I need:  My larger B&D convection oven/toaster oven started to die after about 12 years, with the auto shut-off failing, causing a potential fire hazard.  I bought this one, as it was a little smaller in size, however, the thing I love about it are the knobs.  They have the ridge in the middle which makes turning the knobs much easier on my arthritic thumbs.  The only thing this is missing is a one-sided toast for bagels, but I can live with that.\n \n  Not sure how this product got any positive reviews, it is very flimsy and purely dangerous to keep it in your household. It is simply a metal box that gets extremely hot as soon as you turn it on, you need to make sure nothing touches it, you don't touch it and nothing is placed on top of it - which is very impractical in a small kitchen. Additionally, the minute we turned it on, our apartment was filled with some chemical, burning smell, that won't go away for an hour. I cannot imagine placing my food inside. returned. Better pay a double price and get something safe.\n ", "\n  It works great for toasting any and everything, making deli-style sandwiches or baking something small for 1-2 people. Heats up quick, and has a very loud/distinct timer which also shuts the oven off automatically after it dings. Very convenient. I only have two complaints and they\u2019re fairly minor at that, but worth mentioning. \n  For the price, it does the job, but it's not all that practical. \n  Had an older version of this toaster oven that lasted 7 years and 8 months. Wanted a toaster oven with no convection and was glad Black & Decker still made them. This newer version has same features as one it replaced with updated look to knobs/handles/shape. The non stick surface is an improvement making cleaning up easier, no more scrubbing of rack and crumb tray to remove burnt cheese, etc. The toasting is stronger too, no need to set darkness as high as old appliance. The crumb tray catches more debris than older version as it sits on the oven bottom inside of the appliance instead of sliding in on the underneath on the outside of the appliance.\n \n  I love Black + Decker products so I find it hard to believe that they have produced such an unsafe toaster oven.  The toaster controls are terrible. More than once we have had it not turn off and it has started the toast on fire.  Why would you have the \"stay on continuously\" in an area that is so close to the toaster settings.  You will think you have set the toaster to go off but it just stays on because you pushed the control down a little too far.  Stay away from this product :)\n \n  Honestly, I'm disappointed in this purchase and if I hadn't already recycled the packaging, I'd return it.  The controls are not user-friendly.  I was really excited about this purchase since I bought it with our wedding gift money, but the french/English on the controls throws me off every time and it's just too much to try and figure out how to make a slice of toast without burning it.  You have to really watch it or else it burns and that's the whole reason we bought this thing.  There's no preheat ding either.\n \n  decent toaster-oven for the money.  But do not like the timer dial.  Very hard to regulate the time to toast.  It either starts to burn or doesn't toast enough when trying to set it correctly.  There are no dashes on the dial, just a couple of little squares with a large distance between.  So it is a guessing game every morning to set it where I want for a proper toasting.  Haven't used the oven or broiler yet but think those probably work better.  It is mostly the timer dial that is inadequate for a proper adjustment.  I end up having to stand in front of it to make sure I am getting the toast right.\n \n  The controls are not easy, and you MUST use the timer to start everything.  The timer is a very loud ticking noise which can be heard rooms away.  It also notes in the box, but not in the description that you will notice an unpleasant odor when you first use it.  I, for one, think companies should cure their products at the factory, not in my kitchen.  Sent it back.  We had a B&D for 28 years, but won't buy another.\n \n  Like the way it toasts and it heats up quick \n  It's inexpensive and good enough if that's what you are looking for. I just needed it to get through a month with a broken oven in my kitchen and it was fine. \n  This is a good little toaster. It comes with the usual rack, plate and crumb tray. Could fit the four slices advertised but it would be a little cramped. ", "\n  It was inexpensive and it does what it needs to do. Good as a toaster. Good for reheating a slice of pizza. I don't do anything complex with it. \n  This is the second unit I have purchased in the last three days. The first one sat uneven on a level surface, either the feet were uneven, or the entire body was warped. Returned and ordered the same unit the next day hoping this was an anomaly. Second unit arrived two days later and guess what, this one sat even worse on a level surface. I have attached a photo for reference. I'm thinking these are on sale because they are trying to get rid of defective product. Will be searching for another brand.\n \n  I had the product for a few months now. Today the words outside the oven decided to melt away and now I have to guess what I'm putting my food on. \n  This toaster over works great but it gets hot and will burn your toast if you don't watch it. The dial is an ok way to set the toast level, but the toast speed varies by type of bread. I need to watch the toasting process and occasionally open the door to check with my hand how toasted the bread is. The bell when complete is nice - my previous toaster did not make a sound.\n \n  This little toaster/oven makes toast in a hurry. It is perfect for my purposes (my oven on the big range is broken and I need something now).  The only problem I have with it is that it has too many knobs. To toast a muffin you need to turn three knobs all the way clockwise. When you have your muffin toasted you have to turn all three back again. This is a little excessive. It should have a single button. Almost everyone will never use all those other features and control adjustments.\n \n  I like this toaster oven but it seems at some point someone moved a knob and it took us a few days to figure out why the bottom of toast was not toasting. You have 3 different knobs and for toasting the top two knobs must be turned all the way to the right for both bottom and top of your bready products to toast. Ah! That said, it is a good toaster over in which we are using mainly as a toaster. We have heated pizza in it once and it came out crisp.\n \n  Needlessly complicated knob setup. Not at all intuitive. We've used it 4-5 times a week since we got it, and still have to read the labels each and every time. We had an older Black and Decker toaster that finally quit working, and I wish I could buy that one again. In response to the reviews about the exterior getting hot: IT'S AN OVEN. Of COURSE it gets hot. It doesn't have a lot of insulation like your full-sized oven does to keep it cool.\n \n  After a few weeks of having it, it set on fire !!! If I would have walked away, it would have set my whole house on fire. I\u2019m so upset. It\u2019s a danger and wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to buy.\n \n  It\u2019s a toaster and a broiler and an oven for rewarming food.  Or cooking.  This is a throwback to analog.  Not a single digital control.  To make 4 pieces of toast, you set two of the three knobs to the \u201ctoast \u201c symbols and the third knob is like an old fashioned spring driven oven timer. \n  This is a nice toaster oven. This has a nice feature of a drip pan that's easy to clean. Making toast takes slightly longer than with a regular toaster, but this isn't just a bread toaster. I've made some really good baked potatoes in mine along with toaster pizzas.\n ", "\n  I actually just replaced this toaster oven, it was really good for a while until it began to toast unevenly or not heat up right. I believe one of the toaster heat elements broke. I had it for about a year, and it was likely due to food grease melting onto the element, so not really this toaster ovens fault necessarily. I do like the model I bought better, though. That one feels a bit more roomy and better built.\n \n  This product is smaller than the dimensions listed.  It's only about 15.4 inches wide, 9 inches deep, 7.3 inches high. The internal measurement is 8 1/2 inches deep.  This is exactly the same size as thecompact toaster oven that I have and I needed something that's a little bit bigger than that and this one is no bigger. I have a Black & Decker toaster oven I've been using for 4 years and it works great. I needed something with a little more - I wanted a little more depth and the convection feature.\n \n  I bought this toaster because I liked the style and it had reasonable reviews. Since then it has completely reprogrammed the toast habits of our entire family. My eldest son has been trying to conduct experiments hoping to get an edible piece of toast - putting bread in one piece at a time. He thought he was just incompetent at making toast. My youngest son won\u2019t eat toast unless it\u2019s brown. This toaster won\u2019t do that no matter how long you leave it in. It does work as a dehydrator but rock hard toast isn\u2019t what we like. My husband has given up eating toast entirely. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to buy a new toaster.\n \n  Do not buy this. This thing set my toast on fire after being on for only a few moments. I literally looked in my toaster, and my toast was in FLAMES..not burnt... ON FIRE. I never write reviews, but considering this toaster almost burned down my house, I feel it\u2019s necessary.  Invest in a higher quality toaster..NOT this one!!!\n \n  Lasted for 2 years before I had any issues with minor use. Maybe 2 or 3 times per week. 30 minutes at a time. Keeps cutting off even with the appliance set to stay on and highest temperatures. Now making an electrical shortage sound within the rear so I immediately unplugged it and checked the wiring. And no issues there. Going in the trash.\n \n  The range for toast was really narrow and it is very difficult to get nice browned but not burnt toast. It seems to be warm bread or charcoal are your only options. In addition, after just a couple months this started to do random smoking and burning. Crumb tray and all interior was well cleaned but it still did it. Very frustrating.\n \n  I bought a new Black and Decker toaster oven as I had my old one for years! It\u2019s nice to have a new one though I burned my toaster frozen waffle right away. Maybe it runs hotter than my old one. Because it got so hot the crumbs that dropped were black. I didn\u2019t clean it up till a few hours later. The hot crumbs stained the crumb tray! I washed it but still stained! May contact the manufacturer to see if I can get another tray. See picture.\n \n  This is a fairly good item. Cleaning is a bit difficult, so I suggest buying some silicone molds for cooking in on here. \n  I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for and as little as $10 can make a difference when it comes to small home appliances. In October, I bought a Kitchensmith that was $10 cheaper than the Black+Decker. That toaster oven was fine as an oven, but couldn\u2019t seem to make toast. It had odd temperature surges mid-toasting. I probably burned over $10 worth of bread trying to troubleshoot it. In contrast, the Black+Decker works great for either baking or roasting. No trial and error needed.\n \n  The only thing I don't like about this unit is the sub-rack tray. This was a great engineering add because it catches crumbs and drippings from the food I've inserted. But... the quality of the tray's surface material is low. As a result, ANYthing that comes in contact with the tray leaves a rather permanent mark upon it.\n ", "\n  It doesn't toast both sides of the bread. It doesn't come with a tray for baking, and doesn't bake evenly, or per the temperatures listed.The entire outside of the oven gets way too hot, even when toasting. I believe this is because the metal on it is paper thin. The cord is incredibly short. It's not even worth the $30 I spent for it. I am extremely disappointed. I thought Black & Decker was a much better company. They should stick to making drills.\n \n  After about 6 months, the automatic shut-off stopped working intermittently.  If we don't hear the loud ding, then we know it didn't turn off, so we have to crank the timer and turn it off again (sometimes several times until it actually dings and turns off).  VERY scary because it could easily be left on for extended periods of time and start a fire.\n \n  I have one, needed another.  This one is much smaller, same 3 dials but they much EACH be turned to appropriate setting before oven works.  Other has 2 trays with catches so they don't tip when pulling tray to remove the items (toast).  Other has the crumb tray under the unit, this crumb tray must be tipped up within the oven (sliding the crumbs..sometimes off INTO the oven) before removing.  A couple of times the timer didn't shut the unit off and caught toast on fire .. must watch timer!\n \n  This toaster oven is freaking me out!  I've had it for a few days and each time I use it (daily), it seems to get hotter and hotter and now it is starting to smoke.  I will contact manufacturer as soon as I can but I wouldn't recommend this product if you don't want to set your kitchen on fire.  I should have checked reviews but I needed something quick to replace the last black and decker that was catching fire.  (But, that one was old so I gave it a pass).\n \n  It's been years since I've owned a toaster oven that's truly good. This one doesn't toast evenly and takes forever to toast. I would have preferred controls in English only. Having 2 languages (French and English) slows down the process of setting dials and is visually unappealing. Small capacity means you can't bake very much of anything.\n \n  Works as advertised. Better than a toaster. Excellent for reheating fries, fish stix, etc. No more using the oven to cook small things. Great for summer and not heating up the whole house.\n \n  Is a very nice toaster oven, but would have been nicer if when you open the door the shelf automatically pulled out so that you could grab the food easier without touching the hot shelf. Also it might have been nice to have a drop open bottom so as to be able to clean the bottom of the toaster oven a little bit easier. It does do a fantastic job of toasting and cooking small meals.\n \n  I purchased this toaster oven in November but didn\u2019t have an opportunity to start using it until two weeks ago. The first time I used it I thought something seemed \u201coff\u201d. With a couple of subsequent uses I thought the toaster oven might just be a little finicky and hard to gauge. Today I put bread in to toast. I few minutes later I looked up and saw smoke pouring out. I went over to it and saw flames inside. Luckily I was able to reach the cord and I unplugged it from the wall. I could still see flames. I grabbed my fire extinguisher and put out the fire. It was very unsettling.\n \n  I was very excited to get this toaster oven. I have never purchased a used-like new product before. I figured that someone had purchased and it just wasn't what they had thought it would be. Unfortunately, the package I received was missing an entire tray. I will most likely return as there is no drip tray as promised, making for a messy bottom. The first picture is the image on the box showing the drip tray. The second is what we received. So yeah, that's a bummer.\n \n  No frills toaster over - great for basic needs of toasting and baking/reheating. I really like the removable base for easy cleaning & crumb clean up.  To toast you have to turn timer  to 10 minutes then back to intended setting- hopefully this does not wear out quickly.... month+ and no problems yet- ", "\n  If everyone who first uses this toaster is confused about how to use it,  I would say its a clear indicator that product design is terrible.  Also the tray blocks the bottom heating element, so foods get half cooked.  You have to put aluminum foil on the bottom to collect drippings and crumbs.  Black and Decker needs to get out of the toaster oven business.\n \n  This toaster oven was nearly perfect until it started to make a loud noise when you turn it on.  It seems like a vibration that subsides once the oven gets going.  It is annoying and it was not there at first.  Even so, the oven works well and the knobs used to control the different functions are so much easier to use than our previous experiences with toaster ovens.\n \n  This toaster oven is a bit smaller than what I thought. But it fits in small places and works well. The shelf tray only has area for 2 slices of bread.\n \n  I've lately longed for our original B&D toaster oven.  We had a bigger brand that took up too much counter space and didn't toast well.  I'm pretty proud of myself, as well, for finding a cutting board (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053UM3O8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that fits on top of it so we don't melt bread wrappers. I've further insulated between the oven and bread board with two silicone pads (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W4C23PM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n \n  I had a black and decker toaster before that why I bought this one .  But this one has more to do and it more expensive looking than the other one.  It cooks faster  I put my toast in it and a few minutes it's was done.  Thanks\n \n  Purchased toaster oven to replace a Bella brand toaster oven I had purchased at Macy's on a super deal weekend promo. I was used to toaster ovens working for about 2 years then they seem to stop working but this Black and Decker one was only 7 months in and all of a sudden it would toast but would take double the time it used to take to toast (what was 4 minutes became 8 minutes to toast, so forth...) not only that but it was a very light toast at that. This was also my first time buying an small kitchen appliance online and I'll have to say I'm going back to old school and buying in store. Just bought a replacement traditional toaster (not toaster oven) at my neighborhood Walmart.\n \n  Hard to adjust toaster but does an ok job.  Top is evenly toasted but bottom has lines because of rack.  I really liked the old B&D toaster oven I had that I could just set the toast and it would shut off and open the door.  Not true that you cannot shut it off prematurely, but you must turn the timer to off.  Opening the door will NOT shut it off as stated in other reviews.  Oven temperature is not very accurate, but good enough for most heating.  For the price, it is a good value, but you need to learn how to use it.  Frozen toast toasts easier than fresh.\n \n  Made sturdy and works well for heating however back gets very hot and cannot touch or have anything around it - and the ticking sound made when timer is already off may be a defect. Not sure but it is not a great sound to hear when unneeded.\n \n  It works. I wish I would have paid attention, there is another model slightly larger. I bought this so my kids could make their bagels and make fries if they wanted to... the bagels toasted nicely. The knobs are kind of confusing/wonky. The temp for fries and a \u201cmini pizza\u201d were a little tricky. Seemed like we had to heat it to higher than 450...\n \n  I like it all from the price to all the features. It is perfect for broiling for two instead of using the broiler in my full size oven, especially in these summer months. I also save on my gas bill and the toaster oven is good on the electric bill.\n ", "\n  I liked its size; not too big for a small kitchen, not too small to toast cheese toast, and individual pizzas, etc. Its also easy to clean the crumb tray, lifts right out!  I'm very satisfied with it. BLACK+DECKER TO1313SBD 4-Slice Toaster Oven, Includes Bake Pan, Broil Rack & Toasting Rack, Black\n \n  I bought this to use instead of a microwave and also I hate using the oven in the summer. \n  This toaster oven apparently has 2 settings when toasting bread. They are \u201cburnt to a crisp\u201d and \u201cburn beyond recognition.\u201d You literary have to stand in front of it to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen. Even then, toasting is not even. I bought this to replace the one I had for more than ten years.  Horrible purschase. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t last. Did I mention it makes weird cracking noises as well when in use?\n \n  Disappointed in this new model of the Black + Decker 4-slice toaster oven. I had bought one in 2016 and absolutely loved it. Recently my toaster oven stopped heating so I thought I\u2019d replace it with the same model but newer. The new one arrived today and the \u201cstainless steel\u201d look In the pictures is not accurate. See picture of my old one on the right and the new one on the left. The new one looks like a weird graphite gray. It is not shiny like stainless steel and clashes with my other stainless steel appliances. Sending back for refund.\n \n  This arrived intact but with evidence of poor Quality Control.  The unit itself was \"crooked\" somehow and sat on only 3 of its 4 legs, so it rocked back and forth every time you touched it. Sending it back.\n \n  It's really a nice toaster, but there are SO many options and ways to work with it that it's confusing. I put it on broiler mode, but then it doesn't heat up unless I change the setting to 450 degrees or some crap. I put it on baking mode and it turns on until it reaches 350 and then turns off, then it turns on to bake until it reaches 350 and then turns off. It just doesn't make any sense, or maybe I'm just missing something but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.\n \n  A simple reasonable toaster oven to replace the really old model I burned up with a fire inside.  Was worried about the front loading crumb tray but it works very well, covers the entire floor of the toaster oven, an is easier and more convenient than the old style.  Only complaint is that the dial emojis are too small for senior citizen eyes.  I added magic marker to make it easier to know the difference.  My son, who has the same one, doesn't like that it won't go off automatically if you pass by the off bell, but I haven't found that a problem.\n \n  this product is complicated.  The dials have multiple languages on them and they are difficult to read (get out reading glasses!).  Difficult to understand how to use just to toast.  Worst part is - when it's on toast - it has a clicking/old school timer countdown.  SO ANNOYING!  Just make it silent!  Will be returning.\n \n  This is a great toaster oven replacement to the one I had for a few years. Easy to use, has all the right controls to cook my food how I would like. Looks great and doesn't take too much counter space. Very happy with my purchase.\n \n  Heats up fast which is good and bad lol. Keep an eye on your toast! I love how fast my breakfast is ready. Good value for a little machine that packs alot of heat. Watch your fingers on the door handle if you have something heating for longer than a minute. The handle gets HOT too. In the end i am happy with this little guy!\n ", "\n  Smoke coming through both sides of oven door. Burning wire smell.  Returning and purchasing another brand.\n \n  It\u2019s a little on the small side but for the price you really can\u2019t beat it. It does everything we need it to do\u2014 great basic toaster oven and it looks nice on the counter.\n \n  Like others have said, the burned plastic smell is quite strong. It unevenly toasts so we have to turn over the food halfway through. Also, now there is a strange sound that occurs during the cooking process that never happened before.\n \n  For $40 and the black and decker brand I expected more!! \n  Have been using B&D toasters for years and something always breaks on them. They are not made to last forever. Basically I keep buying them because they are cheap and do a good job before they break down. Also like how compact they are due to my limited space.\n \n  Uhhh! I am very disappointed in this product. The settings on the multiple dials are very hard to read because they are so small. Three different dials to  adjust just to make a piece of toast. Thought I had it turned off and it was actually still on. After toasting three frozen waffles the handle was very hot to the touch. Did not burn but still too hot. The toasting dial makes an annoying ticking noise like an old timer. My elderly father has difficulty turning the dial that must be turned to set the toast to cook and that must be done every single time you use it! I would return it if I had not already used it.\n \n  This is a small toaster. The door angles back (not flush) so this can prevent casserole dishes from fitting. Plus your casserole will be very close to the eating rods. This means it toasts your bread very quickly (so watch it the first time you use it for toast). \n  Its nice because it heats up extremely fast and it cooks thoroughly but what sucks about it is the timer is faulty. It randomly turns off several times and leaves the oven cooking when it does. When it works properly the timer should turn off the oven completely but when the timer stops it will keep cooking and burn your food or could catch fire so you have to watch it!\n \n  I\u2019ve had this toaster for a few weeks now and I\u2019ve had a very good experience with it, I mostly use it for toasting/broiling but I\u2019ve baked pizza rolls in it and it works nicely. Heats up quickly and toast evenly. Only thing I don\u2019t like it that there are Spanish words under each English word on the dials, it looks a little clustered but welcome to 2018. Would recommend.\n \n  Nice design, very easy to use, baked my pizza perfectly! The only thing I don't like is the constant loud ticking of the timer. Would be nice if it was silent. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase!\n ", "\n  Have only used it as a toaster so far; very pleased with the way it evenly toasts bread. One point though, you can't use the same \"degree\" to toast all breads. Example: Sourdough takes a longer toast time than does ordinary white bread or Chicago Italian, you have to watch. Appliance has clean lines and is attractive.\n \n  Toasts well but caught on fire! I had the setting on broil and the next person toasted a piece of bread on the same broil setting. Several minutes in, the toast caught on fire! Then when we opened the glass door, the flame got bigger and was coming out of the toaster. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an uncommon mistake to leave it on the wrong setting..\n \n  My first one i had since 2006. Im only giving it away because i wanted a new look in 2020....its the same model. And still works great....so buy this because they never die.\n \n  It doesn't toast both sides evenly.  You will need to flip it midstream or toast twice. \n  My wife wanted it, and is pleased.  Happy Wife, Happy life!  It nicely filled a spot of our counter where there was clutter, encouraged some cleanup, and my wife who can build delicious food from nearly nothing now does it in a smaller oven.  ..and enjoys it.  Me, I'm kinda \"meh\" but it seems to work fine.\n \n  This oven replaced an older B&D toaster oven that stopped working after a number of years. I have a small space for this unit and this one was close enough to the old unit that it fit just great. Easy to use and works very well.\n \n  I hate it and never should have bought it. \n  KNOB WRITING IS SO SO SMALL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ADJUST THE DIFFERENT CHOICES FROM WARM, TOAST AND BAKE. I MUST LOOK SO CLOSE AT THE KNOW EACH TIME. I EVEN AT TIMES HAVE LIFTED THE TOASTER OVEN UP TO MY GLASSES. THAT IS A CHANGE FROM THE LAST TOASTER OVER BY THE SAME COMPANY FOR THE WORSE. PLEASE JUST LEAVE A WELL DESIGNED ITEM ALONE AND STOP REDESIGNING IT. OTHER THAN THAT THE TOASTER OVEN WORKS WELL.\n \n  ordered as a gift...problem with it smoking some when first turned on and smells like plastic burning...they have removed all the plastic they see so not sure where the plastic smell is coming from\n \n  I'm so glad i read the other reviews that mentioned the smell, because that way i didn't freak out when i got this thing and turned it on. i've used it a few times now (mostly on broil but once on oven to reheat something), and it does seem to work pretty well and efficiently, but it still smells pretty bad even after a few minutes. i'm hoping that will go away over time and more uses. my previous toaster oven is also B&D (about 9 years old) and i really don't remember it smelling at all, even in the beginning.\n ", "\n  Our oven went out right before we received this toaster oven in the mail. We ordered it before our oven went out so had no clue how much this toaster oven would come in handy.  I love this product and was amazed at how well it baked and toasted things I would never have expected to make in it, but had to without an oven for three weeks. We baked oysters, baked cookies, and even roasted brussel sprouts. I highly recommend this product.\n \n  Love it!  The last toaster oven I had was a convection type.  Took way to long to heat up and it took too long to cook. It was way too big.  This one is awesome!  Heats up quick and crisped up the tater tots fast.  Toast comes out perfect!  Would highly recommend this oven!  Someone mentioned the settings were difficult to figure out, I didn't find that to be the case at all.\n \n  It toasts evenly and even though it is low-tech (turn knobs instead of pushing buttons), you figure out where your favorite settings are for bagels, etc. I rarely use bake, but I am making a french bread pizza in mine now.  I like that it is small. When my daughter's big one, that had to take a lot more electricity for just a bagel, died, she asked my advice for replacement.  We love 'em.\n \n  The toaster burns the toast, and it's really difficult to get it set correctly. And if you do find a setting that works, you'll need to reset it every time. It's just too difficult to do the simplest of tasks - make toast. We're sending it back.\n \n  The toaster oven seems well made and is very easy to use.  Amazon delivery was great.  It is not easy to clean but that seems to be the case for all toaster ovens.  Have had it for just two months but have given it 5 stars on its performance so far.  Hope that holds up.\n \n  I had a similar toaster that was 10+ years old.  Recently changed out all my kitchen appliances and wanted to just have everything match and be new.  Wow.  I use this toaster more than my $1100 oven.  Simple controls, easy to clean, perfect performance!\n \n  If you are looking for a basic toaster/oven this is a good choice.  Heats quickly and evenly for reheating or cooking small dishes.  Small footprint.  Adequate size for a 1 Qt casserole dish or 5 biscuits. on the tray.  We use foil sheets to line the bottom and the sheet pan.\n \n  I heated taco shells in my previous toaster oven for years. Twice in the past 6 months, the shells caught on fire. The fire was bad enough this past week that the toaster needed to be thrown out. It also burned toast really quickly. The only thing it was good for was heating my kids\u2019 frozen chicken nuggets.\n \n  Never used it.  Loved the look but it came with a 3 prong plug and I live in an old house.  Gave it away.  Wish the product description had mentioned that.\n \n  cheap, cheerful and absolutely perfect for what it was bought for. not only can I make toast, I can also bake shrink plastic and polymer clay easily and quickly right up on the counter without heating up the oven! perfect!\n ", "\n  The timer is not accurate but otherwise this product is good.\n \n  Knob for setting toasting time is hard to set consistently to get toast that is neither burned nor just warmed. Works great in broiling and baking functions.\n \n  We do not over use the toaster oven, and it died one day after 9 months.  Did check the settings etc, and the timer still works but very low heat.  It was good while it lasted, but does it need three dials?  it should not have to be this complicated.\n \n  We had one of these same models and the upper heating element cracked and shorted out the appliance after about 2 years. We bought this same one to replace it and are hoping the last one was just a fluke. Works great so far. Its small on our counter, we didn't find another one we liked as much that was a nice, compact size.\n \n  My son bought this for me for my birthday and I love it. I can put something in there like a piece of chicken or salmon, bake it for 10 minutes and then switch it to broil for another 10 minutes and it's perfect. Makes it so easy. I was cooking dinner one night for my niece and she saw how easy it was so now she has one. A lot of features for the money. And the Totino's pizzas fit right in. Saves money on using your big oven when you have small things.\n \n  So far so good - this is a reasonably priced toaster oven and does the job for basic needs. I can't speak to the longevity yet but I have had good results with Black and Decker for other products so I hope this stands up to the test of time with daily use.\n \n  It works OK, but the controls are different from previous models and are difficult to use.  It does have a tendency to to burn edges without completely toasting entire slices [of home sliced loaves not pre-sliced bread].  It can overheat and has to be kept away from other things.\n \n  I love this toaster oven, it\u2019s perfect for every day and easy to use.\n \n  Has a hard time shutting off automatically\u2014you know, like a toaster oven. Seems to default to continuous baking, resulting in a lot of totally carbonized prices of bread.\n \n  I needed to replace the el cheapo Wal-Mart toaster oven I'd had forever that was showing its age, and this one has turned out to be a very nice value.  Looks attractive on my counter space and is convenient to use.  Very solid value for the money.\n ", "\n  I replaced a Decker I had for years.  It was easy to toast, broil and  and bake.  The dials on this model are super confusing. \n  I had an earlier model of this oven for years- used it almost everyday and it worked like a charm, but this one does not! Black & Decker - why did you make so many changes? The door no longer has the hooks that pull out the rack, making it safer for everyone to use. The rack height is too high to the element so watch those hotdog buns closely! The dials are confusing and hard to read. It takes much longer to heat up. Ugh!\n \n  Maybe it's me, but just don't like the style of this oven. Plus it burns the edges of toast without getting middle done. Have not tried yet on heating anything else though...maybe it will do better with that\n \n  much smaller area to heat /bake items because the rack is almost in the middle of the oven so there is very little headroom....very disappointing.  Would not buy again\n \n  Yikes!!! Do not buy this toaster!!! The timer mechanism got stuck and caused my toast to char to the point of a catching fire! Thankfully we had a fire extinguisher near by or it could have burned down the house! They need to recall these!\n \n  The oven function works well enough, but the toaster toasts totally unevenly -- the part of the bread slice that's in back is overdone while the front edge is almost untoasted.  I thought Black and Decker brand would be a better buy than this turned out to be.\n \n  This is a great little oven when you don't want to heat up your big oven.  It heats up very quickly and does a great baking job!\n \n  I have only used a couple of times but think I am really going to like this to make small pizza's, toast etc. \n  I've used this to toast bread, muffins, pizza, french fries. I made chicken nuggets a couple times. I tried to heat up some soup. It works for all types of bread and heats up quick. Fits about two standard bread slices and takes up minimal counter space. It's great for making melts.\n \n  Es peque\u00f1o y c\u00f3modo para un apt peque\u00f1o o familia peque\u00f1a. Cumple bien con las funciones. Trae todos sus accesorios.\n None ", "\n  Only had this toaster since Aug 23rd and the top knob already broke off booo..  We found the operational knobs confusing and sometimes you would think you turned it off but it wasn't.  I'm no so sure I would buy it again.\n \n  Hi, Iris here. Toaster oven delivers on everything promised: it's nice & roomy inside, toasts bread (bagels, etc.) perfectly. Warmth feature keeps foods nice and warm, no over-toasting or burning anything. And clean-up is super easy.  I highly recommend this product, and I would purchase it again.\n \n  bakes great!  The temperature is accurate so I don't burn meals.  Toasts evenly, and quickly (almost too quickly).  good price.  I wish it was slightly taller but for the price i can't really complain.\n \n  When you turn the dial too far the oven stays on. I have been unplugging after every use for fear it will stay on. Also seems to take longer than other toaster ovens\n \n  I had my doubts however it was perfect! Any oven can make toast this one is my first to cook a fine steak!\n \n  Easy to use product with fairly simple design that we were looking for, did not want an eye sore on the kitchen counter.  That said, it's a little smaller than we were used to.  Typically we fit two full bagels (halves) , four slices of bread, or a medium (8-9\") tortilla on toaster oven trays.  This one is kind of small, but we make it work.  Average in terms of easiness to clean.  Decent price but should have purchased something slightly larger.\n \n  The description said a four slice toaster, but there is no way that 4 slices of bread would fit in this toaster.  The best I can do is 2.\n \n  I didn't like this toaster at first; but now I am not sure I want to live without it.  It did smell the first couple of uses and I burned a few pieces of toast until I got the timing down; I really like it now.  Great for toasted cheese, etc.\n \n  Works great! I bought it to use for my clay & jewelry making. I tested it out on making cookies first. I like it that it has a button for broil, bake, warm. There's a button for temp and another button for timer. The temp automatically shuts off when timer is off so nothing burns.\n \n  The toaster oven is very well made for the price. Lite weight but cooks fantastic.  I would definitely recommend buying this. The pan and grill given are very useful. And all the settings help in many types of cooking and reheating.\n ", "\n  EXCELLENT PRODUCT! \n  It took a bit to make friends with this toaster oven.  Not the most user friendly, but once we made friends with it the contraption does a fair job!  We still don't know what the little knob is for on the back of the oven?\n \n  Was disappointed with this product. When you open the toaster door it continues to run if you don't turn the knob to off  Seems dangerous\n \n  When I received this I loved it! I didn\u2019t have a stove at the time so this was a perfect buy for me. I of course couldn\u2019t buy the bigger pizzas like Tostitos but I bought the 1.99 ones and they cooked well. I would buy again if I had too.\n \n  It has a removable tray on the bottom of the cooker to catch your crumbs, very easy to clean.\n \n  I haven't had a toaster oven in a long time.  I expect it will take some getting used to.  So far, so good.  I mainly wanted to be able to make toast and toasted cheese.\n \n  If you're looking for a 4 slice toaster oven, then this one is a great buy at a great price. I thought it was a 6 slice and so it was too small for me when I received it. I don't cook anything smaller than 6 slices of bread because I am a large male.\n \n  the main thing we use our toaster oven for is frozen pizza. This one is way too narrow to fit anything more than a couple slices of bread. Going to return and buy something wider.\n \n  i have always loved these toasters but this new model just doesnt heat up right.  might be this particular one but seems to only have one level of heat no matter what i set it at.  also didnt come with a cooking pan which is ridculous...just a crumb pan.  would never buy this model again.\n \n  Works great. Haven't experienced any of the explosion issues others have mentioned. I only wish it came with a few baking trays for when I'm warming stuff that will fall through the rack.\n ", "\n  If you are nearsighted you will have trouble reading the small lettering on the control knobs.\n \n  Very satisfied with this toaster oven! I use to toast, bake or broil and it functions quite well! I like the function of the controls and the ease of settings. Good value!\n \n  My toaster oven of three years (different brand) which was more expensive didn't do as good as a job toasting as this little guy. Love this toaster oven. It gets the job done and the right price!\n \n  I am most concern that people will use this device and not watch what is happening. \n  Garbage. Wish i had believed all of the reviews i read about it only lasting a few months. Mine was purchased 6 months ago and stopped working today. Does not heat up. Interesting the return window is only a month long. Guess i'm going to Target to pick up a toaster.\n \n  I just used this for the first time today and it started on fire within a few minutes. It took my husband and I so long to take out the fire, all from just trying to toast some bread. There was smoke throughout the entire house from using this for the first time. We had to throw it away....no one should ever buy this product, it is extremely unsafe.\n \n  This toastier oven get 6 stars! It heats up and the instructions are easy. Cooks toast very fast!\n \n  Pro = Crumb tray is easy to clean. \n  I went from 5 stars to 1 start.  After owning this for just a short year, this toaster oven does not toast evenly.  Burns on one side, and hotter in the back than the front.  If i could return it i would.  I'm shopping for a replacement and bringing this to the dumpster.\n \n  Worked fine for a couple years, but now the timer gets stuck just before reaching zero. This means the oven stays on until it is manually turned off, and that it does not ding to indicate that the time is up. Now that I've burnt my toast a couple a few times, I'll be getting a different oven.\n ", "\n  love my toaster oven from heating up leftovers to making a toasted bagel perfect\n \n  Black n Decker toasters have been getting cheaper and worse every year. This however is better than the $30-$45 toasters. But u gotta pay like $60. But overall this is a good toaster. I wish it didnt have the digital buttons and wished it had knobs.\n \n  After three months of purchasing, the toaster is no longer working properly.  The timer does not work, and the only way to turn off the toaster is to unplug it.\n \n  No bells and whistles and seems cheaply made BUT it does heat up whatever needs heating. Not certain I would do it again -- very entry level.\n \n  I use the oven quite frequently so I don't have to turn my large oven on and heat up the entire kitchen.\n \n  works great so far, however it stops cooking when timer goes off. I can not figure out how to get it cooking w/ out timer. wish I could find one that worked w/ out timer. maybe it does but I cant figure it out otherwise great little toaster oven & drip pan is a nice plus\n \n  Have a teenager and a lot safer than using the oven and less heat during the summer and easier to use as well.\n \n  The lights on this oven started getting dimmer and dimmer which meant less heat from the day I bought it until about 2 weeks ago and threw it away because it took to long to toast/cook anything. If you want a toaster oven that will only last you like a year 1/2 buy this one. Piece of crap!\n \n  Good unit for what I paid for it. Got it open box through Amazon Warehouse. Works as advertised. It's plain and simple, no bells and whistles. Works exactly as I need it to.\n \n  Toasts unevenly.  Buttons and face of machine get very hot with little use.  Very small inside. Main problem is how unevenly it cooks.\n ", "\n  Great quality and works very well. I love toasting my food rather than heating in a microwave. It comes out crispy and good. Yum\n \n  Great for the price. Does what it needs to do! Good size for our limited kitchen counter space.\n \n  It works great! Toast is evenly browned. Pot pies cooked well. Product is worthwhile. Watch when you open it because the door can easily bang on the surface you have it on.\n \n  Great looking toaster but trying to read the nob settings so I could simply toast something was a challenge in part because of the small print and each nob is shown in 2 languages which makes it \n  The broiler does not get hot enough to broil. I had an old one like this that I had for years and loved it. So I bought the same one. Baking and toasting is fine, but I can\u2019t broil meat.\n \n  Liked the size..fits well in small space..worked well for 3 months..[bought Dec. 2017  stopped working Mar. 2018] Had to change from 4 stars to 3. So it's just o.k. for me..maybe mine was just the problem one.\n \n  I have had no issues with this product, I like the array of controls it offers.  It is better than heating up a large oven to warm up bread rolls, I would think it saves on power to heat a small space verses a large oven.\n \n  This is my 2nd one of these - I guess I used my other so much it wore out.  Cooks evenly and is a great alternative for making a snack or food for a couple rather than using the regular oven.  This is my go to.\n \n  This was my fourth try at replacing my toaster oven.  It was the closest to the one I was replacing which was at least 25 years old.  I still can't seem to regulate the toast feature and really haven't tried the other features.  It gets very hot on the outside which didn't happen on the old one.  Both were Black and Decker.  It isn't Perfect, but it works.\n \n  I love this simple easy to use toaster oven. It bakes, broils, and toasts without heating the entire kitchen. It's very easy to keep clean. I especially like the crumb tray.\n ", "\n  A bit \"over done\" with all of the different knobs and settings for me - as a Toaster oven. But, no complaints. And I am especially pleased by the VERY easily removable crumb tray. Shipped on time and great price for what you receive.\n \n  I read so many reviews on these things at the lower end of the price range and I was scared to buy any of them.  Each one had at least one review of something horrible happening!  So I just picked this one and so far so good.  I bought it for work to replace our old nasty one.  Works well and the ding is loud for everyone to here.\n \n  So far it\u2019s been a great lil amenity. My husband been asking for one for sometime bc he swears by them.\n \n  Brought this product in May and by October it's no longer working properly. Before it used to make a \"ding\" noise once the timer runs out but now it just continues to heat food until you stop it. You have to unplug it in order for it to stop heating up. DIsappointed because I loved the features and how great it worked at first.\n \n  Been using this for a long time and still working. Its perfect for the summer to cook small snacks or toast (anything to avoid turning on the oven and making it hotter). Easy to clean tray and love the multiple cooking options\n \n  Have been using this lovely oven for a month since purchase. Never encountered any problem. Good for toasts, roasting salmon, chicken breast, etc. Highly recommended.\n \n  We use this every day for heating and broiling things...mostly my 24 year old son!\n \n  Actually this is a great price for a great toaster oven. I really don\u2019t like using the microwave and this does the trick for me. I love the mini size too- not too bulky but not too small.\n \n  Easy to clean and maintain for an office environment. I bought it for our break room and everyone loves it!!!\n \n  Seems to be good. No problem work elements or the door. It does get hot, but that's kind of the point- we just don't touch the sides or top whole we're using it.\n ", "\n  Easy to use and I love this and use it daily.\n \n  Love the removable bottom tray that keeps it easy to clean. I haven\u2019t had it very long yet but it works great so far for toast and baking small things.\n \n  We love it! I have this to my parents for Christmas last year and we loved it so much we bought ourselves one this year. Works great and a great price!\n \n  It's a WHOLE lot smaller than it looks. It's basically a bread toaster since nothing else really fits.\n \n  Made my entire house smell like burning plastic.\n \n  Buena inversi\u00f3n, buen producto y precio justo\n None \n  Works great, sometimes makes weird noise. One negative thing is that once you set the timer, you can't cancel it or shorten the time, all you can do is reduce the heat.\n \n  I love it. It looks great on the countertop. I did not experience any weird chemical burning smells when I used it for the first time. Great for the price. So far so good.\n \n  I have always been afraid of using toaster ovens because of the heat they generate but this one has enough clearance at the bottom that I don't have to worry about my counter top catching fire. I LOVE it!\n \n  Works like a charm! No smoke, no fire, it doesn't over heat and it cooks evenly from what I could tell, at least for french fries. I like it because I have very limited counter space and it fits perfect in my small kitchen!\n ", "\n  Toaster is OK, but it does NOT toast evenly!!!  Top is  almost OK,  but bottom?  No.  So far that's all I have used it for.  SORT of afraid to try broiling or baking.  But I did get it mainly for toasting, and uneven toast for me will be OK. Look around first. It is cute on top my micro.\n \n  Does not cook the recommended time on instruction. Everything has to stay in longer to be done. Everything else works fine have not had any other problems with this product.\n \n  Works great still after a few months\n \n  Purchased to use in my travel trailer.  I love that it is just large enough for the two of us and does not heat up the inside of the trailer when I use it.\n \n  This is the 2nd of these I have had\n \n  Great for toasting, but some items the top burns before the bottom gets warmed, e.g. reheating pizza slices, nachos, or anything thick. For the price, satisfied.\n \n  Fits 4 pieces of toast as described\n \n  Very touchy. Simple toast burns easily even if it\u2019s a hair over the medium line.\n \n  I\u2019m pleased with my purchase.\n \n  Muy buen producto facilita el trabajo en la cocina ahorras tiempo y dinero ademas de brindar varias opciones como tostar azar etc\n None ", "\n  Does not have auto turn off and on, is difficult to set, and seems \"tinny.\" Would have returned, but was too lazy. I've had Black an Decker before, this was totally different and lacking in ease of use and safety modes. Don't buy.\n \n  When I first opened this and plugged it in, I didn't think I was going to like it, because it doesn't go flush against the wall.  However, I have changed my mind, and now love it!  It makes perfect toast (better than any toaster I've ever had), and use it a lot to heat leftovers, bake biscuits, pizza, etc.  It was well worth the low amount I paid for it.\n \n  Seems to work fine. Use it for toast and French fries, warming pizza. Doesn\u2019t take up a lot of counter space.\n \n  I can\u2019t say about everything as it is new but so far I\u2019m very pleased\n \n  everything was as described!\n \n  This is dangerous.  It is very easy to start a fire with this toaster oven.  The settings are difficult to understand, and when making toast, when you don't follow instructions exactly, the toaster does not turn off.  We have started two fires while making toast.  Even if you operate the unit correctly, a setting of \"medium\" still causes the toast to burn.\n \n  Good little toaster oven.  Stress the \"little\".  It was much smaller than I anticipated and smaller than the one it was replacing.  My only suggestion to a buyer is to make sure the size is what you need.  If so then this unit works nicely especially for the price.\n \n  This is an excellent toaster oven with a lot of little adjustment options for whatever and however you want to make your toast or even heat other foods such as some foods that are not good heated with a microwave.\n \n  toast takes a long time :(  it's smaller than the cuisinart one we had before this which I now miss for its speedier toasting capability and size.\n \n  BEWARE OF THIS OVEN - I just bought it, put a slice of bread in to toast on a medium setting, walked out of the kitchen for 2 minutes, smelled fire, came back in to find FLAMES IN THE OVEN, was afraid to open its door so waited a minute for it to burn the toast up completely and luckily the flames started to subside. Imagine if i hadn't been there to supervise this, there would have been a fire in my kitchen! I packed it right up in the box and am shipping back to amazon, but most importantly - WANT TO BRING THIS TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION\n ", "\n  works good a little hard to regulate time, I either burn my toast or I under toast it.\n \n  Perfect combo of size, versatility, and dependability for years. Just replaced the same model that after 5 yrs had lost its oomph. Bought one for a friend as well.\n \n  This is the 3rd or 4th B&D toaster oven I have purchased (always this model).  It is not expensive and works quite well.  Toasts, bakes and broils.  Compact size is perfect for a one person household.\n \n  Measurements are wrong.  Did not fit in my space and I had to return.\n \n  Breaks down after warranty is over\n \n  Bought as Christmas gift. She said she hated it. Said it was difficult to use and to clean.\n \n  Great toaster oven for a really great price. Everything we have tried making has worked out well. Cooks pizza, baked potatoes, meat, french fries, toast etc. perfectly. I would definitely purchase it again.\n \n  works great love it\n \n  For the price, cannot complain. It works as advertised, glad I purchased this item.\n \n  Perfect for purpose needed\n ", "\n  Fast delivery. Works great\n \n  its presence on the counter is lovely, but besides asthetics, it works wonderfully.  Temperature is on the money, it gets to where you set it, and is not off like a lot of units.  Things cook well in here  have used it many times instead of my oven!\n \n  As far as I know, it is very useful, was a gift\n \n  I've literally only used this twice to cook chicken nuggets for my daughter and already the metal tray that goes inside it is rusting and the tray that catches the bread crumbs is rusting too. Waste of money\n \n  It's a little small, but it's a good deal. The cord is just a few feet in length. Unless you're plugging this in on a counter that has an outlet right on it, you'll probably want an extension cord.\n \n  I\u2019ve had this two months and the heating element is already going out! Very disappointed!\n \n  This oven is a small but would be adequate for individuals or small households for a variety of uses, except for the unreasonably small bake pan. It is more than an inch narrower that the slide rack. The toaster works so quickly that for now I have to watch carefully not to burn the toast.\n \n  Not working after couple using. Oven didn't stop to create heat even after timer was off.. had to plug it out because i was scared it will catch a fire. After that, timer did work but oven isn't creating any heat.\n \n  What an annoying design. Takes up more space than necessary with silly curved 'pizza' shaped rear. Never know if it's really off.\n \n  Very nice and large. Controls are a bit confusing, there are too many options, though. Each dial has to be set to toast or you won't be getting toast.\n ", "\n  The toaster caught on fire (the upper heater) and melted the insides, catching on fire that I BARELY managed to extinguish. Bad product! Dangerous!\n \n  I use it a lot. It doesn't toast bread evenly so I always get burn crusts. Otherwise, I like it for making individual pizzas.\n \n  I would give it a zero if I could. Worked fine for a month and a half. Almost as soon as the return window closed it started emitting a toxic smelling smoke. Rip off.\n \n  Great\n \n  I use mine for all warming up left over pizza, or fresh made, sandwiches, bake and grill steak's and chicken, etc. also toast , Save's $ and time. And it looks great.\n \n  Love\n \n  I just received this Black & Decker toaster oven not even a week ago and it sparked a fire while making breakfast this morning for my son. Thank God the small fire was contained quickly.  Black & Decker is supposed to be a great brand, I guess I got a defective unit.\n \n  Excellent. We've used it for a few months now and it works great. Easy to clean. Looks sharp on the new kitchen counters.\n \n  This toaster's dials seem overly complicated for a simple toaster. But more importantly, a piece of toast went up in flames a few times into using the toaster. It seems extremely unsafe and I plan to return it.\n \n  product measured up to expectations.  Easy to use.  Unlike older models which were difficult when adjusting different functions--this model is simple to operate and the temperature guides are easy to use.\n ", "\n  Awesome toastEr oven. Warms uo very quickly.\n \n  I am apprehensive to buy any other Black and Decker product. I plugged the toaster in within the first hour of receiving it and put a piece of bread in. I followed the directions for \u201ctoast\u201d and as you can see by the picture, it was burnt Crisp!!\n \n  Working great, easy to clean, toasts adequately\n \n  Good for the cost.\n \n  Ordered from Amazon Warehouse and was delivered broken.  Ordered another one and it worked OK.\n \n  After two years it STOPPED TURING OFF!!!! Have to unplug it to get it to turn off. Fire Hazard. One Star Per Year.\n \n  This toaster oven is really small inside.  Had to buy smaller baking/broiler dishes in order for them to fit inside.\n \n  This is great for a single person. Only takes about 5 min. to get to temperature, unlike my full size oven. The broiler works perfectly. I use for frozen foods and for bake fish! Best investment I've made!\n \n  Not worth $10.  First time used it started smoking.  Burning off some type of film.  Months later it still overheats and gives off smoke.  Just cheap and dangerous.\n \n  This is my first toaster oven. I'm very happy with it, and the price was great.\n ", "\n  Runs hot. Lowest shelf for toasting burns toast. I have to cover food with a piece of foil to keep it from burning while food is heating.\n \n  We love the toaster oven. we had a Black+Decker for about 10 years and had no problems with it so we wanted another Black+Decker.\n \n  We were toasting Bread and it caught fire.  Head to take it outside to put the fire out.  SENDING BACK TO AMAZAON.  I have a 21 year old Black & Decker toaster over and am glad that we did not throw it out.  Guess they just do not make them like they use to.\n \n  It looks sharp on my counter and serves my purpose.\n \n  Great little oven, I keep mine in my room on my desk to make pizza rolls when gaming :).\n \n  Great item. Looks pretty in the kitchen. Warms up really fast. Arrived when expected.\n \n  not used to a toaster oven, but like how it works in comparison to a regular toaster so far\n \n  You can't really cook a cold hoagie because the top of hoagie burns,  no manual telling how to operate it,  smaller than I thought , have only used it twice.  Doubt that I get much use out of this toaster oven.\n \n  Works great. Saves turning on the full size oven. Does get a bit hot while using.\n \n  Great toaster oven, had it for a while now and no issues. Good quality for the price, although sometimes I'll notice that the timer stops while the oven stays on. Not always, but sometimes.\n ", "\n  It can do many things. But i hope i can be able to clean the part of steal above the bottom heat pipe.\n \n  Works well.\n \n  Easy to use, very good price. I wrap an aluminum foil around the drip tray so that I don't have to wash it.\n \n  Works great\n \n  I use it every day without a single problem. A very good product.\n \n  Fire hazard.  Had to return because it never turns off.  Had to turn it manually to make it stop toasting.\n \n  I just love this. We are a family of 4 and I use it almost everyday. From toasting bread to baked salmon, grilled chicken, and grilled beef steak, it can do anything and everything. I haven't tried baking. I'm sure it will be just great as baking in the oven.\n \n  Bueno f\u00e1cil de usar\n None \n  received package and it did not work\n \n  Does a great job and beats out more expensive toaster ovens.  Carefully read the instructions.  Learn how to properly use the settings and adjust the timer dial to your liking.\n ", "\n  Fabulous little toaster oven! Does everything you could want perfectly! And a VERY reasonable price too! SO glad I bought it!\n \n  This only has one inside rack the last one I had did had 2 so it gave you a some options. Not as nice as the last one I had.\n \n  Works phenomenally, great buy. Worth every penny. It does everything from toast to bake to reheating food. Keep you catch tray clean to avoid smoke!\n \n  If I try to turn the control dial counter clockwise to turn it off sometimes it turns past the off without making a ding and goes to the continuous run mode. This can be dangerous even causing a fire if you are unaware that it is still on and go off and leave it.\n \n  A little difficult to understand all the options, especially without glasses, but looksand works great\n \n  I've had this toaster for 3 months and today I was toasting a taco shell for all of 1 minute and the entire toaster oven caught on fire!  I am shaking right now!  I barely used this so it was practically new when this happened.\n \n  Pretty decent small toaster oven. It\u2019s good for two people. I wouldn\u2019t buy it if I was using it for a larger family. Takes kind of a long time to make toast in comparison to a traditional toaster.\n \n  excellent! toasts evenly....compact size.... looks nice....easy dials to understand... \n  We decided to ditch the microwave and used this instead. Love the way it cooks!\n \n  Works wonders\n ", "\n  this product is very small you can fit toast barley a  piece of pizza as long its not a deep.or to tall. should of bought a toaster.\n \n  Very good value for the money.

Would like to return\n \n  works well, but takes forever warm up, good price\n \n  I purchased this because it had everything I wanted in a toaster over and I could bake smaller items while my regular oven had the larger items in the off chance I was having company. Unfortunately, after a few uses, the burners wont turn on when on bake mode. So now, I am essentially stuck with a very large toaster.\n \n  Just a tad more fancy than we need - more bells and whistles than we need, but no complaints...\n \n  I have only had one occasion to use this new oven...Hard to read the words & numbers....had to get out a flashlight to see the settings....\n ", "\n  Perfect size, looks really nice, does everything I ask of it.  I'm very happy.\n \n  smoke and toxic smell comes out of vents of this oven. Fire Hazard. returned immediately\n \n  Looks nice, works medium quality.....\n \n  Very nice toaster.  Takes a bit of getting use to.  Experiment with the timing according to the type of bread you choose to toast.\n \n  If you need a Toaster Oven for the office or home this is a great value. Good size and quick.\n \n  I had to return it. It was defective and would burn anything you put it in no matter of low the temperature is.\n \n  This is my third Black & Decker toaster oven (over approximately 30 years) and the first time I've been disappointed with my purchase. Feels light and flimsy like this one won't last very long. Previous models I would use as a toaster oven but this will only be getting toaster use.\n \n  Disappointing. Hard to use it as a toaster fine for baking\n \n  Worked well for the first few weeks. Then I tried to toast some bread and the whole machine started smoking and turned completely black.\n \n  This is the best toaster oven we've ever had.  Very happy!!\n ", "\n  Ive had this for a year and need to replace it already. Even though I scrub and clean it often, the tray is disgusting. On top of that, it has been smoking. Only buy this is you plan to replace it every year.\n \n  I didn't have any problems with this toaster oven when I purchased it a couple years ago. I decided to buy it again, but it seems like the quality has diminished over the years. The toast option is the only setting that works. None of the other oven settings work (broil, bake, any temperature setting). Looks like I will have to re-purchase a better quality toaster oven.\n \n  So awesome, I use this all the time. Having a toaster oven is great when you dont want to turn on the oven to cook small stuff\n \n  Perfect size for where I needed it. But I've burnt a lot of toast not thinking it would get so hot as quickly as it does. Little tray insert is nice. Definitely not large enough for typical cobbler/brownie glassware (12\"), so gonna have to go mini if you want to cook those.\n \n  It is perfect! Bought it for our daughter in her first apartment and it is just what she needed. Heats quickly and evenly. Very,very pleased!\ud83d\ude00\n \n  Works awesome\n \n  Did not heat evenly. Did not last 2 months. Top element stopped heating.\n \n  Good product.. Could be easier to read functions, but overall efficient.\n \n  As much as I liked the product from what I could see I have no been able to use it since I got it. I have had it for 3 weeks now and didn\u2019t open the box until about 2 weeks ago. When opening the box presentation was nice but it was missing the trays. Since the trays are missing I have not been able to use it once.\n \n  Me and My mom use it a lite\n ", "\n  Our old Black and Decker toaster oven crapped out after many years.  This version of it is poor.  Does not have the holders that when you open door pull out the rack.  Returned.\n \n  Does not toast evenly on both sides.  Auto-Off doesn't always work.  Would not bake in it without standing close by.  Inferior for Black and Decker products I've owned in the past\n \n  Thought I would try and not live without one but I can't. It's compact and slices four. Perfect for small meals\n \n  Excellent toaster oven. Makes that leftover pizza tastes like it just got delivered.\n \n  It's cheap and economical. The back of my oven toasts bread much hotter than the break closest to the glass. So while the front gets a mice gloden brown, the two back slices always get a bit black. Not to worry because someone in the family always wants a bit extra crispy toast. If I make it for myself, I don't push the bread all the way to the back. \n  Ordered this toaster oven one month ago and its already deffective. It doesnt heat anymore when we turn it on (under any settings: toast, bake, grill) Don't bother buying this one. Probably worth spending a few more bucks for better quality then?\n \n  The performance of the device as a toaster and as an oven seems all right. However, the controls are complicated, needing to place the control buttons In certain places for it to work.\n \n  I haven\u2019t had it long, but sometimes it makes me grinding noise.\n \n  It\u2019s a little bit on the smaller side. I have a pretty old model and wanted to upgrade it. I have not tried it yet but will update my review when I do\n \n  It toasts great & is easy to use but started making a loud noise after two uses that will not go away now every time it is turned on. If we didn\u2019t use it, I would have returned it. Do not buy\n ", "\n  Love my toaster, cook my buffalo wings in it\n \n  Had another black & decker toaster oven for 25 years and still worked. Figured I'd try another one. Although on the smaller size it is exactly what we need.  Try to find a better  bang for your buck at $30.\n \n  Great product!!! I can\u2019t believe it is ad clean as the first day. The heat is very even and it quality predicts.  A must buy.\n \n  Toasts nicely but after two months of use the bottom heat element works when it feels like it.  Will give it a couple more weeks and then most likely return it.  All the French words are confusing too so I had to black those out.\n \n  Our first Black and Decker ToAster Oven lasted 12 years. Hope this one does too.\n \n  Gave as a gift and appears to fit the bill without breaking the bank.  Great size for small kitchen/counter space, and doable for a young couple's needs.\n \n  I used it several times a day and it does the job. Bake or toast. I've had one before but gave it to my son. so I had to order another for me\n \n  Almost caught fire on its first use. The wiring inside the control panel was glowing and smoking.  Very disappointed, I know it's inexpensive, but it should at least not catch fire\n \n  Good product\n \n  Works exactly like how I needed, no complaints\n ", "\n  I really like it.

It looks great and price is good but three knobs?  For toast?  The knob functionality is terrible and I doubt the timer will last long but the overall issue with this toaster is the safety.  The door drops open too easily on this and the handle gets hot.  The handle should not get hot.  Our old toaster oven was faster and heated up a lot less on the outside.  This oven gets hot all around.  I probably would have lived with it but my kids insisted it be sent back.  They thought it was really cool looking until they tried to use it and ended up getting burned by it.  They now have a lesson learned on looks aren't everything. \n  Didn't realize tray did not automatically come out when door opened. When something is finished have to pull it our manually with pot holder since tray is usually hot.

Wish I could have bought a bigger one.\n \n  All I wanted was a toaster oven that toasts.  I figured that with something this basic, and that was Black & Decker, I couldn't go wrong.  Oh, how mistaken I was.  This thing is evil.  It foils every attempt to create a normal piece of toast, instead, burning it and filling the kitchen with smoke.  Perhaps if you could adjust the toast setting with the knob, and press a different button to start the toasting, it would be ok - but you can't.  Every single time you toast something, you have to turn the wheel and experience the burnt-bread version of Russian Roulette.  The only thing good about it is that it dings when the burning, I mean, toasting cycle is complete - my previous Black & Decker toaster didn't do that for some reason. Still, I desperately wish I'd kept the non-dinging previous B&D toaster and gotten it fixed rather than saddled myself with this barely-usable appliance.

I've been using this every day; maybe someday I'll upgrade to a more expensive model but this one has worked fine for everything I've tried.  There is a learning curve for making toast; once it starts to brown, be ready to take it out because it doesn't take long to burn after that point.

It amazed me how good it works when baking. I like how it has a timer build in it so I was able to easily set the time and it automatically stops when the timer finishes and does ding sound to notify me. The only down side to it is that it does take a little longer to bake than the regular oven which is understandable since it is smaller.\n \n  It works fine, but the cooking tray inside is small.\n \n  Great buy!

It is just beginning to fail and wanted another small, simple toaster oven, and decided to order this B&D model.  I am sorry to report that it came out and back into the box for return shortly thereafter.  Very hollow, flimsy material; the bottom knob with the timer has a ticking sound and is not very easy to maneuver, and the oven gets extremely hot to the touch (much more than the 30-year old oven I currently own).  I will have to continue my search for a simple toaster oven with quality, which I see will not be easy to find.\n \n  One of the peices arrived damaged\n \n  I've had this toaster for almost two years, and have not had any issues. It's relatively easy to clean, toasts at an appropriate rate, and looks sleek enough.  It's a great deal for the price, and from what I can tell, will last a relatively long time. Great for anyone with limited counter space.\n \n  This works well. Small which is why we bought it. It fits in our camper taking up a small space. It is not as hot as others around the outside.\n \n  Love this toaster oven!\n \n  This model cooks unevenly. I bought a Foreman grill to use in its place where I can, and I now only use it to warm food instead of to cook. I give it two stars because it warms food just fine if you select \"bake\". It doesn't really warm food on the \"warm\" setting.\n \n  the settings are a bit confusing, but it's been working great!\n \n  Toasts perfectly!\n ", "\n  Works well \n  Great value - just what we were looking for\n \n  Hot Handle - hope the manufacturer reads these reviews  It\u2019s lovely except: I bought it to replace my old  Black & Decker ONLY because I wanted a pull out crumb tray. As a senior, it became difficult to lift the old one and hold it over the sink to open the drop tray on the bottom and clean it.  BUT this new one\u2019s handle get very hot to touch. And I burned two fingers when I inadvertently touched the black strip attaching the handle to the glass door and found it was twice as hot, if not more, than the handle.  How shocking and upsetting this was.  I would return it but fear all the handles will be the same and I already gave away my old one.  Manufacturer should do a recall and correct this or send us some kind of heat protection to put over the handle and attached strip.\n \n  Have been well pleased with the toaster.\n \n  Works great love it\n \n  It gets super hot after use.

Other than that, works great\n \n  Terrible toaster burns toasts even at the lowest temp - also very hard to read the numbers on dial since all black and very small letters! \n  It toasts well, but not so evenly as claimed.

In the case of all of today's kitchen ovens this is still ALWAYS the logical precedent. But somehow, with many of these moderns toaster ovens, turning the dial full counter-clockwise puts them in BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN mode! WTF?! What a sh!tty design. I was 1/2 step way from calling 911 just to put out the flames from 2 slices of toast when I thought I turned the damned thing off.\n \n  Received in dented condition\n \n  Purchased about a week ago.  Son was toasting a bagel on Christmas morning and the unit exploded into shards all over the kitchen.  Luckily son was dressed for work with thick flannel and work jacket on.  Could have been severely injured.  Have contacted Stanley Black and Decker to report the incident.  TWICE.  Not confident that they are even taking the report seriously.  First in writing with seven pictures.  Received canned email response to contact support line when I gave them all of my contact information, address, email address and phone number.  Called support hotline and it was like talking to a robot with canned responses.  Not confident in all that they are even going to do further investigation.  Researching how to report the incident to CPSC - Consumer Product Safety Commission.  This could cause extreme harm to someone.  DO NOT BUY!\n \n  My similar B&D toaster oven T01356SG has nearly caught fire numerous times AFTER the timer dinged. The element doesn't reliably cut off when the timer is done, but sometimes does. I can remember at least three occasions where something burned so badly I had to unplug the oven, grab hot pads and rush outside with smoke pouring out. I am lucky that I didn't start a fire or set off my apartment sprinkler system. I have had it for a few years, because I really can't afford a better one. I thought I was doing something wrong until I found so many other customers report the same issue with Black and Decker toaster ovens. Buyer beware!!\n \n  I've had this toaster for one week.  It managed to set the toast on fire and almost set my kitchen on fire.  The timer scale is total rubbish, it is so inaccurate and fussy that, you can't set the toasting time without either setting the toast on fire or not toasting at all.  The oven does not evenly toast both sides of the toast, leaving one side overdone and the other totally untoasted. \n  Not quite what I expected, but I'm keeping it.  Thank you.\n \n  I received this toaster oven only 6 weeks ago. It took me a week to get around to unboxing it and using it, then last week, a whopping 4 weeks after I started using it, the heating element went out. It will now become a huge piece of waste in landfill because I\u2019ve had it 2 weeks too long to return it. It was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for. \n  This was a gift for a friend. It does not work, at all. I went to help to get it working twice, and nothing. I tried all troubleshooting that I know of in this instance. It doesn't work. So imagine getting a gift for someone who you know could actually use it, and it doesn't work. \n  About burned my house down!! First of all, it takes a few minutes to figure out all the knobs and what to set them all on just to make a piece of toast. We finally figured it out and successfully made toast. Often times the timer does not go off when using the toasting feature so you have to watch it. One time I forgot to watch and the toast was getting black. I opened the door to get it out and the toast burst into flames! I quickly shit the door, unplugged it and ran it outside. I tried to contact black and decker but their website was not working (or my phone wasn\u2019t cooperating) so after entering all of my information, I couldn\u2019t hit submit. But I do not recommend this product as it is a fire hazard.\n ", "\n  Frustrating and poorly designed controls: \n  I have found this to be a very fine toaster oven, doing everything promised and it is easy to keep clean. I have used it for almost two years w/o an issue, well, except for one. The cord is 24 inches long and emerges from the right side corner of the oven back. If your electrical outlet is to the left of the oven, you have already \"consumed\" 14 inches of that length. Now you are left with 10 inches. Don't forget you need some space around the unit during use for safety. There is only one place in my kitchen (which has five outlets) that I can reasonably place this toaster oven, and it is not a preferred location. It needs a longer cord.\n \n  I bought this toaster oven at a store but after reading reviews on here and trying it out myself I am returning it. As some others pointed out, the handle does get hot because heat escapes from the top of door. My old B&D did not do that. In fact mine is still working but looking a little worn out. Also, again as others pointed out and I didn't really pay attention to when I bought it, why do I have to turn 3 knobs to make toast? The old one I'm using you turn one knob. Also the bottom knob that you are supposed to turn to 10 and then back down is ridiculous and hard to turn.\n \n  Much too small inside.  Most  normal sized baking dishes will not be usable.\n \n  A good deal for the price and looks nice. Works really well in small kitchens. \n  There is a dial to set how long you toast the thing for. There are kind of marks on the dial but it's impossible to tell how far you turned it. It's very, very powerful, meaning it burns your toast almost instantly and you can't set the dial to just toast it for a minute, it's either 2 seconds or 10 minutes. Someone should really re-think the controls on this POS.\n \n  Very much worth such a cheap price, but... It is very small and very light (and thus makes me think it's flimsy, though nothing has broken yet). It also ticks loudly the whole time it's cooking and rings a super loud bell when it finishes. You cannot turn this off (at least I haven't found a way to. It just really sucks when I'm trying to cook a hot pocket at 9PM in an apartment complex). It also gets really hot on top when cooking, and it makes me worry about warping something around it. Other than that, it has cooked and warmed things nicely. And it was advertised correctly, I just assumed some not correct things about it I suppose.\n \n  Does a great job for an excellent price. I like the removable crumb tray, makes cleanup a breeze. I can't say I'm too fond of the way you are supposed to turn the timer knob way up and then turn it back to the darkness level you want for your toast. It makes it difficult to get the same darkness each time. I've been just turning it way up, letting it go and watching the toast until it's where I like it, then I pull the plug, remove the toast and just let the timer keep on ticking down until it dings.\n \n  My friend bought this toaster oven a while ago and I was considering buying the same one until I saw it has a California Prop 65 warning. If you are not familiar with Prop 65 it is a California law the requires products containing materials and chemicals KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER to display a warning.  The fact that this product is meant to make food and has a Prop 65 label is disturbing. I honestly don't know how this is even legal to sell in the US. Shame on you Black + Decker, you are knowingly subjecting your customers to hazardous materials.\n \n  Bought this for my 9 year old daughter who has celiac's. I wanted to be able to help her make her own meals, but also make sure she didn't end up with food being cross contaminated by the household toaster that makes Gluten filled snacks for others.

I love it.. I had trouble with it at first trying toast because the booklet is not clean on what temp. to put it on for toast. I didn't think you had to put it on a temperature.. I mean why right?  but my husband said it should be all the way up for the temperature on toast and it worked. the booklet doesnt give alot of info for me.  Kind of trial and error trying to figure it out. But I think I got it now!  In years past they use to have a hook from the rack that attached to the door remember that? I mean some toaster ovens and it was perfect. I haven't been able to find that since.  I don't know why they did away with that because when you opened the door the rack came right out and you could get your toast without having to reach in. I would love to see that feature again.. I hope the manufactureres of this toaster oven read this and add it.. Then this would be perfect..\n \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven 4 Slice, Multi-function Stainless Steel with Timer - Toast - Bake - Broil Settings, Natural Convection - 1100 Watt --is a great addition to our kitchen.  It is much more powerful than our previous entry level \n  This product is easy to use and looks like a professional stove brand but smaller!  The stainless steel does not show finger prints and cleans easily. I looked for weeks at many other brands and was grateful I found Mueller.  I loved that they gave a recipe book and also a free peeler as well. I thought it might be too big however it fits on my kitchen counter perfectly. I was impressed with the 2-year warranty. Did not find that with any other manufacturer I researched. A great find.  Harold R.- Houston TX\n \n  Just received my Mueller Toaster Oven.  It was well packaged and delivered promptly.  This is a great little toaster oven. It comes with a rack and baking tray. The crumb tray opens up easily and will be handy to keep clean. There is an Instruction Manual and Recipe book also included.  The 3 knobs on the oven are for Temperature, Function, and Time.  They are very easy to use. Please note that the settings are manual and are not digital which I really like. Less likely to have problems with it. Temperature ranges from 150-450 degrees. There are 3 Function choices designated with an icon - Bake, Broil and Toast. The timer goes up to 30 minutes or you can use without a time control by turning knob to Stay On position.  I christened the toaster/oven by making toast! I turned temp to Max, turned the Function knob to the Toast icon and set the timer for Darker setting. It took longer than a regular toaster but I was testing it and will have to adjust. Also baked biscuits in it which turned out great and didn\u2019t have to use all the electricity to pre-heat and bake in my range. A Temperature Guide for different kinds of foods is included in the Instruction Manual.  I am very pleased and happy with this purchase.  The Mueller oven has a sleek design, is multi functional, and so easy to use.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for a toaster oven.\n \n  I like that it's pretty simple to use. No complicated, overly technical stuff. Basic functions. We use ours everyday. It was actually a quick replacement to warm up pizzas, fries and chicken nuggets..etc after our oven when out. The toast function works really well and I actually baking pizza in this rather the the oven because it heats more evenly and the pizza comes out nice and crispy. \n  This great oven is made by an Austrian company, Mueller.  It is sleek with a sturdy design.  It has great sturdy controls with a well designed timer that allows you to accurately time cooking or just leave the oven on without using the timing device.  It has an easy to clean detachable oven bottom.  The heating elements are enclosed and not exposed - easy to clean.  5 star rating!\n \n  Stainless Steel. Blue LED.  Easy to use controls. Large viewing window so easy to see how food is progressing. Great value. Small counter footprint.  Nice results on my first few projects.\n \n  I have had toaster ovens for many years.  I basically just use the bake setting, since these ovens rarely toast well. \n  We purchased this oven to replace our toaster.  I can only rate this product as average.  The wattage is low, which requires additional time to make toast, etc.\n \n  UPDATED REVIEW: ", "\n  The heat generated from such a small device is impressive.  Heats up to 450 quickly.  But it is not so much a toaster oven as there is no toast setting.  You have to set a timer and then watch to make sure it is not burning.  The rack settings are either 2/3 of the way up or 2/3 of the way down so unlike a toaster which is designed to toast evenly this will toast one side more than the other based on positioning of the rack.  As an mini it is great.  But I planned to use more as a toaster.  Having said that I did make garlic toast which came out well after I adjusted the wire rack during the toasting process.  But I did have to pay close attention to the toast so it did not burn.  For all other purposes seems to be a nice little unit.\n \n  This toaster over is so easy to use.  Only have three knobs.  One is stop, broil, bake and toast. Another is temperature and the lasts a timer. No electronic to mess this up which was the demise of my last oven. It is small and fits well in a small kitchen nicely.  I give it 4 stars because there is a couple of problems I had to remedy. First it does get hot if cooking for some time. The door handle does not get hot but the steel plate right behind it does and I burned my finger the first time on the burn out they recommend in their instructions.  I cut a small 1 1/18\u201d X 9.75\u201d thin board and lodge it between the handle latches. This fixed this.  The wire tray does not slide out when you open the glass door after toasting. I simple folded some tin foil and looped it around the wire tray. Just reach in grab the foil and slide it out.  Not sure why their engineers didn\u2019t figure this out before production. If it wasn\u2019t for these small problems it would have been a 5.\n \n  Good solid product. Unboxed today. Shipped quickly. Heats fast and seems to heat eavenly. Looks nice. Compact and attractive (as attractive and I\u2019d expect a toaster to be).\n \n  I should have just send it back after it came, it felt flimsy and very light weight. After two weeks the door started becoming stuck and didn't want to open. Maybe it got damaged in shipping? The box wasn't damaged in any way. Haven't seen anyone else mention this problem I had. \n  We use this to toast fresh baked sourdough bread.  Great little toaster for the price, and heats up much faster than having to heat the entire oven. \n  I have baked apples, pot pies, heated pizzas & made toast in my new toaster oven. The pizza & small pot pies were evenly heated, no burn areas while others were OK. It has a wonderful timer a quick distinct ring that's loud enough to hear several feet away. I use it as a timer to tell me when the oven is warmed up + also when things are cooked [it turns off automatically when the timer goes off.  A blue light goes on when it's on. It has smaller print on the side panel because of its size. The knobs are easy to turn.\n \n  Overall I like this toaster. Fits well in our apartment with small kitchen. \n  Was excited to receive this toaster oven due to all the high ratings. I was very disappointed when the timer did not work correctly for the toast settings. The oven does not turn on unless you turn the timer dial past the \u201cmedium\u201d toast setting and then the oven shuts off before passing the \u201clight\u201d toast setting. Basically, it\u2019s defective and not able to do the basic thing it\u2019s supppsed to, make toast.  Other than that, the \u201cminutes\u201d part of the timer worked for the bake settings.  One other weird thing was you need to turn the temperature setting up to max for the toast setting, that\u2019s dumb, it should know it needs max heat for toast when it\u2019s set to \u201ctoast.\u201d I\u2019m plugging back in the cheap $20 toaster oven that we\u2019ve been using for the last 3 years and sending this one back. It at least our cheapy one gets the toast close to correct.\n \n  Attractive smaller toaster oven. Glass and stainless steel on front, black top and sides. Seems to heat up fine. \n  This toaster over does what it says it. Does. It is rather small- which I needed. I do have questions about long term durability as I plan to use this oven practically everyday. So far so good, but we\u2019ll see. I also made a bad assumption when I saw this as an Austria product, I figured it would be more sturdy. It is not. While it looks solid, it\u2019s just as flimsy as it\u2019s competitors. ", "\n  UPDATE: as I wrote this review toasting my English muffin, for the third time I realize the heating element isn\u2019t even working!! \n  I have owned this for FOUR MONTHS and the hinge that holds the door shut broke off tonite when i was getting teady to cook some food for my daughter. I literally propped it shut with a wooden spoon lodged against a 5lb bag of sugar. None None None \n  \u00a0UPDATE: \n  I previously had a Breville toaster oven.  It was a gift so when replacing it I didn't want to pay the price.  This toaster oven had great reviews.  The price seemed reasonable.  Everything about it felt \"cheap\".  Opening the door I could feel how lightweight it was.  In fact the whole unit is lightweight.  It only has one heating element on the bottom and one on the top. The bottom is a drop down door as opposed to a pull out tray which makes it more difficult to clean.  Most annoyingly the tic-tic-tic as it toasts.  When trying to cook a homemade pizza I put it on bake which only uses the bottom element.  I had to switch to toast and then use broil to help melt the cheese.  Toast seems to take longer than it should.  For the price I have bought Black and Decker toaster ovens.  Should have stayed with them. Overall disappointed.\n \n  It's the perfect size and easy to use but the bottom tray does not slide out. Instead one has to pull it down in order to clean. Rather inconvenient.\n \n  I was looking for a smaller toaster oven to take up less space on the counter.  This one does that but also does not accommodate four bread slices for toasting.  Perhaps it was designed for smaller breads than we use at our house.  With many attempts at different placement of bread slices for toasting, the results were always a matter of uneven toasting.  We could not find any placement that would result in even toasting on both sides of the bread.\n \n  It is fairly simple to use. My 8 year old was able to learn to use it. It did take us a moment to realize you have to set the temperature in order to use the toast function. Please use caution when taking tray out because the open door is very hot and it is easy to touch and get burned. This is a smaller oven but can easily toast 2 slices of bread.\n \n  Great price and functionality! The Mueller MT-175 Toaster Oven has easily become one of my go-to kitchen appliances. It is stainless steel and is not unnecessarily bulky, which makes it ideal for homes or apartments with limited counter space (see photo for visual reference). In fact, it is smaller then the package dimensions annotated in the product info section, measuring approx. 9\" x 14 3/4\" x 9 1/4\" (H, W, D).  It is also ideal, if you do not have dual-ovens and need to cook a couple dishes simultaneously. \n  This toaster works fine, but is definitely a lower quality than the Cuisinart that we had before. It is very lightweight and flimsy and it wobbles on flat, even surfaces. I didn\u2019t realize how much I liked my last toaster until replacing it with this one. The craftsmanship on this toaster is poor. There are pieces on each side that should be identical but are slightly off. Overall, I regret this purchase.\n \n  This toaster literally burns everything cursed enough to be put inside it. It\u2019s vindictive and cruel. ", "\n  Just a comment on how hot this thing gets: \n  I was replacing my old toaster oven with this Mueller model because it was on sale.  The directions gave it many restrictions, such as not operating on the same circuit with another appliance  , not placing anything on top and  keeping it several inches away from the wall. After first use, I can see why. It gets extremely hot on the outside. You could very easily get burned. If you decide to place something on top anyway, it will probably melt or stop working if it\u2019s another appliance.  The function settings are written so tiny and light that they are hard to see with the bare eye. Other than that, I guess it does the job. Although I regret purchasing this. \n  The instruction book contains many typos and misleading information.  For instance, it says \"use Crumb Tray\".  Here's the catch:  There is NO CRUMB TRAY PROVIDED with this toaster, and when you look into the interior of the toaster, there is no room to insert one and in addition, the coils underneath the tray shelving make it impossible to thoroughly clean after usage.  You would have to hold the entire toaster upside-down and shake crumbs loose. I find it strange that no one edited the instruction book for erroneous info.  I returned this to Amazon,\n \n  Terrible quality, false advertisement on size, there is NO slide out tray for cleaning , extremely small, not worth the price at all. Do not purchase.\n \n  I love this toaster oven. It's very easy to use. It heats up very fast and won't make you wait long. I love that it cooks evenly. All the settings are very helpful and useful. I love the detachable tray that makes it easy to clean the oven, very convenient. The oven is compact and won't take up too much space in your kitchen. It has beautiful stainless steal finish that goes perfectly with my other appliances. The only thing is this oven's surface gets really hot while operating, so make sure to be careful. Overall, very nice, quality toaster oven that looks great. Highly recommended.\n \n  I liked the small size that it doesn't take up much space on the counter. It looks very nice and it is light weight. I figured out that you have to turn the temp way up to get the heat to stay on. I might be doing something wrong but it works for me so I'll continue that way. Good value for the money as well. I threw my old toaster away and won't even consider purchasing another \"toaster\" as long as this one works the way it does.\n \n  This was a bust. I am replacing it just a few weeks in. Burned the crust of a pizza and rendered it inedible.\n \n  Didn\u2019t work properly...had to return \n  I like this toaster. The controls are easy to read and use. I especially like the tray that is removable. My old one slid into the sides, but this one fits on top of the grill. I like that. The door has a nice sturdy feel with a good handle. It is also attractive and a little larger than my old one but fits well in the same place. The only negative is that it is not a convection oven even though it was said to be \"natural convection.\" I don't know what that means. But I am happy with it.\n \n  I bought this for two reasons: 1) It was supposed to be able to toast 4 pieces of bread at once, which was twice what my old one could do . . . and then this one turned out to be even smaller internally than my old one, and 2) because it had a removable crumb tray. Sadly, even though the description says it has one and the manual says to \"remove the tray and soak it in water to clean\" it has the standard flip down tray my 30 year old toaster oven had. ", "\n  95% of the usage of our old toaster oven was toasting bagels in the morning.  The old one had a lever, so all you had to do was push down on it and adjust the dark/light setting to what worked and then never have to adjust again.  This toaster has a very imprecise knob that I'm supposed to turn to try to set a time for toasting, but half of the time it doesn't even turn on when I set it to the medium setting and the other half it stays on way too long and I end up with two hockey pucks.  The difference between a barely toasted bagel and hockey pucks seems to be one small click, which changes its location each morning to a different part of the knob.  The knob fails to go \"ding\" sometimes which makes me wonder if it even works right.  Then I have to guess what is the correct temp to toast bagels at.  I like the size, the heating element looks like it works well and heats up super fast, but after throwing away bagels morning after morning I'm ready to give up on this one.  To make it the perfect toaster just include the old fashioned button for a fixed duration and let me adjust the heat to find the perfect temp for a well toasted bagel.\n \n  It cooks ok, though not as easy to use as my much older,  cheap one.  It didn't smoke when getting it ready to use (it tells you to heat it up to burn off oils before you cook with it) but did make some funky odor for a little while.  It did smoke a lot once time when I used it, though maybe bc there was still grease in the pan from the use before.  My old toaster oven never did that though no matter how dirty it was.  It hasn't done it since.  I've used it about 8 times or so since getting it a couple weeks ago.  It's a decent size for width and depth,  but not much height like my old one.  Today,  I made a flatbread,  and granted it was piled up a bit (avocado smeared on the bread,  grilled chicken strips,  covered in cheese), and it BARELY fit without hitting the top burner even on the lowest rack. I like the look of the exterior, and the bake/broil/toast function options. Timer only goes to 30 minutes,  so anything longer you'll have to reset it, but for me that's enough for anything I plan to use it for.  It does make a soft ticking sound from the timer... not enough to bother me, but it might for some people.  I can't speak yet to durability.\n \n  Wow. Out of the box, this oven met my expectations which are high. We've had the Hamilton Beach 2 in 1 for over 15 years and although still working, it's old and a little under-powered. We've since grown to a family of four so toasting bread requires a tad more space and yet, we don't want to take up too much countertop space. This is Perfect sized for our needs. The stainless steel is beautiful and matches our kitchen. The dial from ez bottom rack/bake, top rack/broil & both racks/toast is simple. There's a standard temp setting. And the timer works well, with a mechanical 'ding'. I just followed the directions to clean the inside and 'toast/oven clean' for 15 minutes so indeed the place stunk up (this is a must!!). However, I'm no longer concerned with factory chemicals and can't wait to use it tomorrow. At $60, this seems costly compared to our old 2 in1 at $40 but this thing is gorgeous so we can't wait to test out all the functions. Will edit further as needed. \n  The first thing I noticed is that the toaster does not allow for you to adjust (decrease) the amount of time you want your food in the toaster.  If you set it for 10 minutes and then decide to change it to 5 minutes, the knob does not allow you to decrease the time.  It only allows you to increase the time.  So if you set the timer for 10 minutes and take your food out of the toaster after only five minutes, the toaster will continue running for another five minutes.  Secondly, and most importantly, the toaster takes forever to heat anything up.  As an example, I recently took a pancake out of the fridge (it was not frozen) and put it in the toaster for ten minutes.  By the end, it was barely luke warm.  Even when I use the baking function at the highest temperate possible (450 degrees), it takes an extraordinarily long time to heat anything up.  Don't waste your money on this.\n \n  This thing is ridiculous. I have used toaster ovens for many years. I have never had to set a temperature control \n  I have had this toaster for about a month and so far, it has met my expectations. It toasts, defrosts frozen bread and heats leftovers very well. These are the basic functions I want from this appliance---and it has performed excellently, At first I was puzzled about the \"absence\" of a crumb tray---but a quick call to their customer care solved that mystery. The crumb tray is actually the bottom of the toaster and one cleans it by releasing the bottom and tilting the entire appliance. Though a bit awkward, this actually turns out to be a good design decision as there are no gaps for crumbs to fall through or get caught in tight corners. Thus it is easy to clean.\n \n  I usually put a lot of faith in recommended items, especially when the product is a Amazon's choice! I will be more cautious after this. Why bother implying that this item is some how from Austria, when it is from clearly from China? The unit is very cheap, parts don't fit right, the door hinge seems as if it will break any second. I wish I had read more into the comments. I will be returning this as soon as the label comes.\n \n  So far I've used this oven only for baking potatoes and toasting bread and bagels. The toasting function works well, turning out evenly browned bread, once you learn how to set the timing and position the bread in the oven. (It seems there are only two positions for the rack, but this becomes four if you turn the rack upside down.) This involves turning the heat control to the maximum setting, deciding whether you want to brown both sides or only the top (by activating both elements or only the top one). Adjusting the timer for toasting is a skill acquired through practice, as the gradations are narrow, requiring good eyesight and some practice. (Be prepared to scrape some pieces of over-toasted bread at the sink until you learn.) By the way, the timer runs only 30 minutes, so the \"stay on\" setting is well conceived and essential for foods requiring long cook times. But you'll need a supplemental timer; I use the timer on my microwave oven. \n  I purchased this for two reasons. 1) My 15 year old Cuisinart bagle toaster finally gave out, and 2) I needed an easy-to-operate toaster oven for my 11 year old to use. \n  This is the worst product I have ever bought from Amazon!  My tiny Black & Decker was better than this piece of junk!  The crumb tray is a joke... you have to turn the unit on its side to clean because you can\u2019t remove the crumb tray!  The numbers on the dials are so small that I use a magnifying glass to read them!  The heating is awful.  It burns on the top or bottom no matter how you set it!  I\u2019ll replace it soon and I just bought it!\n ", "\n  For performance and ease of operation this little gem is stellar. \n  I like this product so much Till I cannot even imagine myself on not having it And I cannot imagine not going in the kitchen And not using it.I use it each and every day from the first time I took it out of the box and plugged it up and started using it the first day I open the box and I have been using it every day every sense.but I have a gripping problem because I have weakness in my arms and hands when it comes to turning it to the left is hard for me to do because my hands and arms are so weak but when it comes to turning it to the right is easy but only if it had a rubber grip going around it it would be much more easier for the people that have arm and hand problem that have a hard time gripping things and holding on tight that's the only thing that I have a problem with but other than that I have no problem with the product and the product is a breeze to clean it's not hard at all to clean each and every time I am done using it I take me a damp rag and open up the bottom of it take out the flat pad that's in there and clean it off with the damp rag and put it back in and take the right can clean it and some soapy warm water dry it and put it back in after I have wiped out the inside of it with a damp rag so easy and so pleasing thanks for making this product and also thanks for selling it on Amazon and thanks for making the price very easy to pay for to bring home to use for those that had their hardest times for those that's on a spending budget for elderly people that can't leave home hardly that is a good product for them to use and their home at any convenient time of day evening and night.\n \n  Alright, so I am the kind of guy who would get one of those cheap black and deckers or oyster brand toaster ovens and decided you know what, I'm going to get a non-American cheap brand toaster oven. So far, wow it really works. It heats up so fast, for instance, I only needed to per-heat the oven only a minute or two before actually putting the stuff inside it. I am use to putting my pizza in the oven and it taking like 20 minutes to crisp up but this oven it handles a pizza in just a few minutes and can easily burn it if forgotten for a few minutes longer than intended. This is great quality oven, 50$ well spent.\n \n  This toaster overall does not have any great advantage over any other top five rated toaster. The most disappointing feature is the cleaning function for the crumb tray. the crumb tray is located on the outside bottom of the toaster and if you have large hands/fingers it is difficult to detach the crumb tray from the underside of the toaster and also to fit it back into the clip/slot that holds it into place without having to lift/tilt the toaster up onto it back edge, a very poor design. Caution should be used when using the toaster around children, the top of the toaster gets extremely hot and inattention by adult or curiosity by children could lead to severe burns as it appears that there is not insulating material between the inner and out metal skin of the toaster. There is no auto pull out feature for the door as on some toasters to remove the toast from the rack, the rack is so hot that you have to use a fork or tip of a knife to pull the tray out. Would I buy this toaster again, no ways even with a coupon for $10.00 of the regular price this toaster is no better overall than the $21.99 Black & Decker from Macys and its easier to return, I am not going to pack this up and return it, I will probably end up donating it to Goodwill for someone who really needs a toaster.\n \n  First negative is the \"crumb tray\" is not removable. It kind of spring loaded and you can't open it to clean unless you turn the oven on its back. That makes all the crumbs fall to the back of the oven and makes cleaning even harder. Plus you can't remove it to properly clean it in case you have drips that managed to make it to the \"crumb tray\" \n  I wanted a small toaster oven and this is perfect. I bought it to replace a very old one from a different maker. I chose this model due to small size and separate temperature control knob. \n  This oven is clean, compact, and functional. I like it. But there are a few caveats customers should know about: \n  This is a very compact toaster oven so it won't take up a huge amount of space. I purchased it to reheat  smaller meal-size portions of food that I plan to  pre-cook to last say a week(for one person). So far I have just cooked 3 small  pizzas in it.  I cut a 12 in. frozen pizza in half and about 1/2 pizza fits diagonally in the pan provided. It has an adjustable timer so you can tweak the cooking time as needed(vs a preset digital). I undercooked my pizzas the first couple of times(did not read directions). Anyway all three pizzas ultimately came out perfect. The heat seems to be equally distributed as I didn't burn the crust and the cheese came out slightly browned. I feel this is a much better alternative to a microwave. A tuna melt sandwich is next on my list, which I am sure will turn out great!  Take measurements to make sure a smaller-size oven meets your needs. I feel this is a high quality product that will last a long-time.\n \n  This Mueller unit is very small and thinly constructed. This is my second such device formally I had an Oster which is made by Sunbeam. The Mueller looks and feels more like a toy that might have some utility warming rolls or melting cheese on a bun. It is not a serious cooking appliance. Tried baking a chicken breast and broiling some meat. Both tasks were disappointing . \n  I must admit, we were enthusiastic when we read the reviews. A good deal for the price, we thought. And yet, this was the worst small appliance we have bought in a decade. Poor quality, let's start there. Within 5 months of regular use (made toast every few days, used toaster oven to cook things like chicken nuggets or to reheat leftovers), the hinge on the door literally snapped. That rendered the door unusable, unless we held it shut with another object leaning against it. Even prior to that, it was hard to clean (the bottom does not have a crumb pan that slid out, so you had to lift the whole thing and shake it into the garbage; shame on me for missing that detail). To get it hot enough to cook anything you need to dial it up to 400 degrees. We just threw it in a dumpster, and we could not be happier to be rid of it.\n ", "\n  I had this toaster for less than a month (I ordered it July 12 and today is August 5th). First, it is ungodly hot when you're using it, like the entire thing heats up and the outside is extremely hot to the touch. But, it is an oven- so I could live with that. BUT THEN, last night I toasted half a bagel, buttered it up and walked away to enjoy it away from the kitchen and after a loud glass shattering noise, I realized the glass door shattered and redistributed itself ALL OVER MY KITCHEN!\n \n  This toaster oven runs much, much too hot. I mostly use the \"bake\" function, and everything burns no matter which slot the rack is in. I think it's because the heating element never turns off during baking, and I've never had a toaster oven that worked that way. (The others I've had turn off the heating element from time to time to regulate temperature.) I've even turned down the dial a good 75 degrees and baked for less than half the prescribed time, and the bottom burned even though the food I was baking was still cold inside. \n  Sorry, but this one's a joke. The dials are almost impossible to read, because the type is so small. Settings are confusing at best; it's very difficult to clean - especially getting crumbs out of the bottom. And after that, it really doesn't cook very well! This is a best-seller? Do you subtract returns from the purchases?  I have to wonder why I didn't return it (life was a bit too complicated at the time) and I also wonder why I continue to let it use up counter space.  But it does amuse me; the bottom metal place it molded to read \"OPEN\" and \"CLOSED\" with arrows. Except the arrows point the wrong way (in for open, out for closed) and the words are mirror-backwards, as if the plate was installed wrong. While you're waiting... waiting... for your food to cook, you can try to figure a way that the plate could be installed that would make it read correctly! (Spoiler; there isn't one.)\n \n  As the reviews stated this unit will smoke a little and smell when you first turn it on and continue for several cycles so dont cook right away. \n  I originally received a toaster from this company and the toasting element did not work properly.  I wrote a review and their customer service rep instantly replied to me and sent another in the mail as soon as they were back in stock.  This one works as it should and love the toaster.  More importantly, their customer service rep Julia was absolutely amazing!! She was diligent and responsive and I am extremely impressed by this company!! I will definitely order more from them.  They stand behind their products and customers as every good company should!! You won't be disappointed!! Thank you Julia for making this experience a great one!!\n \n  I returned this toaster oven and I'll tell you why. First, the toasting control is a dial that you have to turn for every toast. The difference between light, medium, dark toast is about 1 millimeter. It is impossible to get an easy reproducible toast. You have to watch what you toast instead of just walking away and having the timer go off. On other toaster ovens I've set the toast level I want once and push a button for each toast. Second,  it takes forever to toast! Even at the highest temperature. Yes, you have to set the temperature of your toasting as well as darkness level with two separate dials. It also toasts unevenly. We had to position the rack very close to the top near the heating mechanism. Even with this positioning it would slowly melt Swiss cheese on top of a sandwich. If we positioned the rack too low, the bottom the bread would be burnt to a crisp and the top would be barely toasted. Thirdly, and this isn't the biggest deal, the heating mechanisms are the brightest I've ever seen in a toaster oven. Oddly, you'd think this would make them very hot and would toast quickly, but they don't! So you're standing there with this bright toaster oven thinking it's going to fry your bread to ash but nothing is happening! It is very annoying. We are toast people and I cannot recommend this toaster oven. I was actually surprised to see it as an Amazon's Choice product, I've always thought their recommendations were good.\n \n  Timer is very insensitive making it essentially impossible to do a light toast. The metal grating over the heating coils blocks the heat so you end up with a band of barely toasted area in the middle of your food. The timer for cooking time is also terrible and I have to use my stove/phone timer if I want accuracy. Wouldn\u2019t buy this toaster again, but hey it looks nice and matches my kitchen so we will stick it out for now. \n  Update: You really can't bake with this toaster oven. Burns on the bottom and cooks unevenly. I think I will try much lower temperature settings to see if this helps this problem. That said, the oven heats up quickly and when you are in a rush it is great to heat things fast. \n  This is an unconventional toaster oven which proves that good looks aren't everything. The first time I tried to make toast was an utter failure. I put the bread in, turned the toast knob to medium. Ticking began and shortly after the bell rang and I withdrew the same piece of bread, completely untoasted. When all else fails \"read the directions.\" From the directions I learned that you have to first set the temperature to get the oven to light; why it was necessary to design it this way I don't know. So turn the temp up high and then set the toast knob to the desired darkness. This works but it takes a few times to get the settings just right, at which point the toaster produces a nice piece of toast. It would have been good to have the toaster rack automatically slide out when you open the door. This was a feature of our old Cuisinart toaster oven and it made it easier to withdraw the toast without also toasting your hand. I haven't use the oven for anything else but toasting to this point.\n \n  This was a replacement for an old B&D toaster over that finally gave up.  Used the B&D models for years finally decided to try something new.  The Mueller seemed to be  about the right price.  Delivery was flawless and the unit looks good.  Fits counter space nicely.  It does take a few times to get toast to the way you want it (temp, time and toast location).  Tried the bake and broil settings and seems ok for small dishes.  The quality of the unit seems no better or worse than the B&D but time will tell.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s a smaller toaster oven which is perfect for 1-2 people. Definitely follow the instructions for your first time use! It\u2019s easy to clean and access. I can\u2019t say too much about temperature control but it seems to be working fine. Heat distribution may be a little off. (I burn the bottom of my cookies when I use the suggested time on the packaging, but notice they\u2019re fine if I reduce the time and then let them sit in the toaster oven while it cools  a couple minutes to finish off the top part of the cookies) overall pleased with the product.\n \n  The Mueller toaster oven is quite compact, smaller than the Amazon specs (until I realized that Amazon listed the package dimensions, not the product dimensions), which was a sweet surprise because it fits even better in our small kitchen next to the microwave. I like the three function knobs, keeping temp, function (bake, broil, toast), and timer separate and easy to adjust. The only negative is that the exterior gets quite hot, so one must be careful, but I am not bothered by this. Overall, I would assign 4.5 stars, but since it's either 4 or 5, I'm giving it 5 because it seems to meet all other expectations. We just set it up and started using it, so we'll see how it does a few months down the road.\n \n  I did a search for dimensions and this toaster oven came up; received it today and was disappointed to see that is was smaller than expected inside.  Went back to read the full description again and seen that the dimension were of the package - wow. \n  I was replacing my 7yr old Kitchenaid Toaster Oven which served me well but started failing. Didn't know where to start so I was comparing a few brands on Amazon. The one I was about to buy was Cuisinart Toaster Oven .  Some of the reviews were not favorable. My biggest problem was that it was made in CHINA.  I noticed this brand, Mueller, and read the reviews on it.  Most people seemed to be very happy with their purchase. I thought about it for a while and decided the price was good and it was made in AUSTRIA. So, I bought it. When it arrived , I was a surprised how much smaller it was than my Kitchenaid.  But, it takes so much less counter space up, it works well for me. I have used it almost every day since it arrived and it works well and I really like it. It is definiitely worth getting. My advise, is GET IT!\n \n  Safety is important with this product....heats up quickly and whole unit feels  hot underneath .....Decided to set unit in a heavy duty cooking metal cooking sheet.....this works great with no heat on the counter area underneath it.....out side areas get warm enough to recommend doing what instruction brochure suggests!  Toasting bread requires constant observation...Otherwise oven works great with the other options..\n \n  A 'toaster/oven' is a compromise. Some make good toast but the oven is too small or underpowered. Some ovens work great but toasting is an afterthought. This model seems a good compromise between both. You have complete control over temperature, which elements heat and the time. I was a little unsure with only a lower and upper heating element that toasting would work, but it does. The dark setting on toast most definitely is what it says. Oven wise I can fit a much larger pan than I am used to and so we now use the main oven less for reheating. \n  Don't like this at all. Bought for my 78 old step father. Several things I don't like about it. First off, it's very tiny. Only the smallest of things will fit in this. Also, the writing is very small next to the controls. Very little space distribution between the different toast settings, you're not quite sure what you have it set on. Also, the timer tickticktickticktickticks as it counts down. How obnoxious! If that wasn't enough, what really pushed me to return it is it doesn't sit flush on the counter. One of the legs must have been shorter than the others...it rocked back and forth and was not solidly on the counter. My step father wanted to put a big fluffy towel under it to compensate...hello fire danger. Very disappointed in this.\n \n  We bought this in late August 2018. It's now early June 2019 and I'm afraid to use it anymore so I'm actually on here looking for a replacement. It was a good little toaster oven while it lasted, but it really should have lasted longer. I chose it initially because I had a very specific spot I wanted to put it in, so space was limited. This was one of the only options with a smaller footprint. If you want something short term and you're short on space, this is probably fine. If you're hoping it will last a few years, I wouldn't count on it.\n \n  This is an update to an earlier review.  The oven that was originally delivered to us was defective -- the handle on the door got very hot.  We posted a review about the heat hazard.  The seller reached out to us several weeks ago months after the purchase.  The end result was they sent us a newer model. \n  I am giving this product a four star overall. The reason is because I realize how to use it properly. The heat is a bit uneven and to bake you need to have the machine for max time. The first few times of use it didn\u2019t work very well but now it heats up well. Be wary of burning food though since the thing only heats on the bottom. The tray is the main issue when it comes to heat distribution. Its too thick. I have been using my old toaster ovens tray. I prefer not using a tray at all for the best results too. If you are toasting something, remember to flip whatever it is because again, the bottom heat is very powerful. The price is way to high for this.\n ", "\n  Did a test by toasting a sandwich and it heated up fast and evenly. We bought it so that we could have something in case of a hurricane to you use with our generator. It worked out great and it only consumes 1100 watts. Might be small for some people so make sure you check its dimensions.\n \n  Updated.  This company reached out after my previous review and sent out a new unit.  I did not reached out to their customer service prior to my review as I should have. They stand by their produce and I appreciate loyalty more than my previous frustration. \n  UPDATE REVIEW: \n  The first oven I received had some sort of power issue, and wouldn't turn on at all.  The company was great to send a replacement.  This replacement oven did turn on and functioned...sometimes.  It stops heating at times, even when there are 10-20 minutes left on the timer.  At first, I thought it was just stopping periodically to control the internal temp, but that wasn't the case. It would stop heating and then not come on again.  At other times, it worked fine, but it was a toss of the dice as to whether the food was going to heat up properly or not.  Toast burns on one side and stays almost completely untoasted on the other side. I contacted Amazon and am returning the oven, and will purchase another brand.  I really wanted to like this small, basic toaster oven, but unfortunately, cannot recommend it.\n \n  This works fine, even well as an oven. As is the case with most  toaster ovens ,(certainly ones at this price point)they don't work very well as toasters. The thing to be aware of with this particular toaster oven is that the controls are simple and not in a good way. One for temperature, one for mode, bake/ broil/toast and another one, a 'stay on' setting or a timer which is for toasting. You must make sure the temperature is turned up to its maximum setting when you want to toast, the  control doesn't do that automatically. I also had to put a broad rubber band on the toast/oven round switch because it was hard to turn because of its smooth surface. The bottom opens nicely for cleaning and getting rid of crumbs. Bottom line, oven works well, controls are poorly conceived . If you want a toaster this is not your best choice.\n \n  I am already searching for a better toaster oven after owning this one for 6 months.  I should have known at this price, it would not be the quality I would be happy with - toast burns, the baking pan is flimsy and became charcoaled after the second time I used it.  Very uneven baking and very uneven toasting.  It is also difficult to clean the bottom due to the position of the heating element.  It now looks MUCH older and worn than it should after only 6 months, as I have only used it about 3 times a week.  This is NOT the right choice!  Go for the Breville - I am.\n \n  You get what you pay for. It does toast things up super fast but at the same time runs extremely hot. It\u2019s probably the most basic toaster oven you can buy for the price. Tray doesn\u2019t slide out when you open the door, it\u2019s not convenient to clean either. No removable tray on bottom that you can slide out to remove burnt and dropped pieces. So you have to unplug the toaster- turn it upside down open the bottom side and clean it that way. I wouldn\u2019t recommend or purchase again. But if you\u2019re single or don\u2019t use it much it\u2019s probably fine. Not good for lots of use or families (meaning lots of people using who may or may not clean up after themselves).\n \n  We wanted a smaller toaster oven and came across this model. The size is perfect for a small family however don't let the size fool you this can toast, roast, bake, keep warm and more. The most attractive feature is the quartz heaters - fast, maintains good temperature control. For toasting make sure the temperature is set high, otherwise it may not toast. Used multiple times a day for heating, toasting, warming plates, cooking with not issues. The only problem we ran into is the spring that closes the door. Fell off a few times, being handy I looked into the spring, after applying a graphite lube has been flawless. Some reviews had issues with cleaning or removing the bottom tray, however we had no issues - pretty intuitive. Overall very pleased\n \n  Save your money and buy something else. I bought this to replace a Cuisinart toaster oven that I had for many years, and I was impressed by all the good reviews and ratings this one had. I do not understand what the good ratings are for. Basically, this toaster oven fails on every measure. \n  This is a lot bigger then you expect.  I was able to toast and cook lasagna at the same time and since it's almost instant heat, I didn't have to wait for the pre-heat and it took less time.  Not only that, about 20 mins after I turned it off it was cool enough for me to clean it. I was amazed with the speed this thing operates.\n ", "\n  I finally made the switch from conventional 4-slice toaster to toaster oven, and WOW what a difference!!  This is my first toaster oven ever, so I can't compare to other types/brands -- but I can say that this Mueller oven is EXCELLENT.  It cooks frozen french fries and frozen waffles perfectly, lightly crispy on outside and fluffy inside, and smells wonderful while baking.  This little oven is super easy to use, to clean, cooks evenly, and does not heat up the kitchen like my big oven does.  There are no burnt or soggy edges whatsoever like with my old toaster.  I highly recommend this Mueller toaster oven, and am beyond happy with it.  Just so folks know, it's not huge, but we wanted this smaller size for our counter and makes just enough for 1-2 people.  It was also a great price for all it does.\n \n  I do like this toaster oven and all of its features. However, regardless of the temp./setting, it gets beyond hot on top and the outside perimeter of oven.  Make sure you do NOT have anything on top or close by as it would melt anything close to it.  Because of this is why I gave it 4 Stars!\n \n  I have many quibbles. \n  I could not get over the fact that the crumb tray is NOT removable so you must unplug and turn the oven upside down or brush the crumbs onto a countertop. I can't imagine trying to clean a liquid spill/burn... \n  I needed a somewhat small toaster oven to have at work. I use it to toast, bake and broil every day. The product came as described. Ive been using it a couple weeks and it seems to do the job I wanted. It only came with one rack and pan which is what it shows it comes with but I needed 2 racks if I am to broil decent. You need a rack to put the drip pan on and on the lower rack setting. Food goes on an upper rack at least that's how I like to broil. The customer service at the company was great and is sending me another rack at no charge and really was concerned about my satisfaction on their product. id recommend this product, at least it works for me.\n \n  NiteFixed my blocked posts. I wondered where everybody had been! This is good to know. It's ridiculous to have over 500 friends and only 25 are allowed to see my posts. \n  I'm shocked at the glowing reviews in light of the price of this piece. It's a small, lightweight toaster oven. That's not a negative but the price? If I saw this in person (rather than here online) there is no way I would pay anymore than $30 MAX including tax. If it had been around $30 then I would be saying, it's OK, worth what I paid for it. At $50, it's overpriced imo. Tinny in the headline is not a typo, it has a tinny feel to it due to how lightweight it is. \n  I've had it for several months, the hinge started making strange noises like metal scraping plus a spring scratching noise, then the spring popped off of where it attaches to the door so the door falls open and smacks on the table. I can't keep the door closed without putting an object in front of it to hold it shut (dangerous) \n  I bought this toaster oven to replace one that stopped working. This is a nice toaster oven. It heats up super fast and does a nice job at cooking the food to an even consistency.  There is not room enough to cook a 12\" pizza without cutting it in half. A square Totino's party pizza fits in the toaster over perfectly with no room to spare.  I will caution anyone buying this that the outside of this oven gets extremely hot. All in All it is a nice little toaster oven and does the job.\n \n  Thank goodness everyone was okay but the toast legit caught on fire on the inside. There were 3 flames \u2014 HUGE for a toaster oven this size. Luckily I bought A fire extinguisher when I first Moved into the house (thank you, amazon Prime) a few months ago and that I\u2019ve had training in using it. ", "\n  I doubt the temperature accuracy of this oven.  I didn't buy for toaster reasons but for small oven reasons and will buy a thermostat to set inside to determine accuracy.  Set it at product recommended temp , preheated and yet had to up the temp 25 degrees and still took 20 minutes longer than package advised (stuffed bread).  Also does not come with much of any directions on how to use.  One page plus picture printed fluff for air fry.  Only tried one air fry and not the best start.  Fresh sweet pototoes.  I don't buy processed food and will try other things before I finally comment on that function.  I do like the interior size but holding off judgement overall.  Will update this review as I work with this product\n \n  In 35 years of owning toaster ovens, this is the worst design I have ever seen. \n  It\u2019s the right size for our kitchen counter in that it holds 4 pieces of toast. Many toasters advertise themselves now as countertop pizza ovens and list the diameter of pizza they will hold. We use this for toast and reheating leftover food. I feared that the single heating element on top and bottom would burn the toast in the center and leave it barely crisp on the edges but I was happy to see that even 4 slices of bread come out very evenly toasted when the rack is in the center position. We love this Mueller toaster and are glad Amazon recommended it due to its high number of 4 and 5 star reviews!\n \n  I've only used this a couple of times so far, but I'm pleased with it. I'd never heard of the brand, but I was looking for a small, inexpensive countertop oven and finally decided to give this one a try. I was tired of firing up the range oven for every little cooking job and heating up the apartment - especially in the summer heat with the A/C already struggling to keep up. It arrived in good shape and has done a great job so far. It even came with a little recipe book and some of the recipes look pretty good - I'm not much of a cook but I might even try a few of them.\n \n  I just received my new toaster oven from Mueller, a brand from Austria.  I didn't hesitate purchasing this oven because I own other kitchen products from the brand and have always been very happy with the construction and durability.  This toaster bakes, broils and has convection.  It came with a rack and baking pan.  The stainless steel provides a wonderful professional look to my kitchen and it shows no finger prints!  The oven is super easy to use and clean.  The instruction book also has some recipes and a option to receive a free julienner peeler as a thank you.  So happy with this purchase because it works wonderfully, thank you Mueller.  *****\n \n  Great little toaster oven!  Good for many uses and the features are wonderful! Oven temperature control, built in timer, and even a broil feature!  All the amenities of a big oven appliance but without heating the entire kitchen for a small amount of food.  Good price too!\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size for small kitchen. It is user friendly and bonus it comes with a mini cook book! I\u2019m excited to keep using this product. It has many different setting perfect for baking small items even cookies! You can also toast a broil. This toaster oven so far seems to be perfect for my small family. It\u2019s a great quality appliance and energy efficient! When cooking just for 1 person it has even replaced my oven which is a blessing on summer days! It doesn\u2019t over heat the house like my oven does!\n \n  Pros: \n  This toaster oven had only one element across the top in the middle and only one across the bottom in the middle.  Wonder how it could toast or bake at the very front or back of the oven.  The broiler/baking tray did not have deep enough grooves for the juices to drain away when broiling which then required that the meat would have to lay in the raw meat juices when the cooked side was turned down to cook the other side.  The tray was not wide enough to fit in the slots at the sides of the oven.  It had to set on the wire rack otherwise the meat could have laid on the rack and dripped down into the broiling pan.\n \n  We purchased this product to essentially sit on our counter and supplement our gas oven. ", "\n  This oven is serving us very well and we liked it even more than we expected. There is only one this we would change and that's the \"crumb tray\". It is not a pull out crumb tray. It is only hinged at the back and you have to tilt the unit backwards on a \"peg\" that is made to do so, but it only opens up and it quite difficult to really get it clean. Also the tray is made from fairly thin metal that does buckle a little with the heat. If they would just improve this bottom tray a little (make it pull out and make it from a stronger metal) this would really be an A+++ product.\n \n  Great little toaster oven! With summer here I hate to use the oven and add all that heat to our house, this solves that issue for so many items. My kids bake crescent rolls for breakfast, pizza rolls at lunch, and s'mores pies for after dinner. We have had this about a week and it has gotten plenty of use both as a toaster and to bake. Temperatures are accurate and the timer is nice and loud so it can be heard without being tied to the kitchen. \n  I love this oven! I initially was looking for a toaster oven and came across this multi-function oven and decided to get this so I didn\u2019t have to use my large oven for smaller dishes, and to not have to use my large oven during summer months as it releases a lot of heat.  I\u2019ve used the bake, broil, and toast settings so far and they\u2019ve all worked just as I hoped, with speed and to perfection! Completely worth every penny!\n \n  I reached out to the seller when I found my toaster oven to be defective.  They are sending a new one to me free of charge.  I am very pleased with their response to this issue.  I am hoping the new one will be perfect.  They assured me that if it doesn't meet with my satisfaction, they will refund my money.  I highly recommend.  The oven itself is beautiful, and fits in my small kitchen space perfectly.  The cord is also long enough to reach the outlet where other brands were not.\n \n  The first one I received started smoking from on of the knobs when I turned it on. I reached out to the manufacturer and they were easy to deal with and sent me a new replacement unit and told me to discard the \u201cdefective\u201d one. That\u2019s really the only reason I would give this 2 stars instead of 1. \n  This is my first toaster oven and I've had it for a month now. While I enjoy having a toaster oven, I am already running into some issues with the appliance. The crumb tray (which is not removable) curves up when heated, so part of it ends up touching the piece of metal underneath the bottom heating element. It looks like it's slowly burning through the crumb tray (marks on both inside and outside of the tray from this), and I can imagine it will only get worse. Maybe because of this (or could just be the appliance), there is a weird smell whenever I use the toaster oven. Additionally, the heating elements just stopped working while making toast this morning and I could not get them to turn back on for several hours. It seems to be working again now, but never a good sign when something stops working after only a few weeks. Unfortunately, the return window closed yesterday, otherwise I would return for a different toaster oven. I regret not returning sooner.\n \n  my parents toaster oven is old and in need of replacement so i bought this and it looked so much better and worked almost the same just look better. this broke within a month or so and apparently didn't work anymore and they threw it away. also had bad heat control sometimes the timer would get stuck and continuing cooking so you would have no idea that you're 15 minute timer was stuck at 10 minutes for 30 minutes and everything is burnt. never cooks the bottom as fast as the top\n \n  This machine isn\u2019t meant for people that cannot read small print. The controls print is so small I have to have my reading glasses on to operate. On top of that the elements are very odd and it\u2019s a very SMALL unit.  I sent this back after one use.\n \n  I bought this for my travel trailer since it doesn't have an oven. I love this purchase! Doesnt take up too much room and adds to our food menu. One more awesome thing about it is that it comes with a grippy bottom so it doesnt slide off the counter even when we drive. Definitely recommend!\n \n  OMG... What a disappointment. Pay $50 for a nice toaster oven, and this is what you get:  First of all, I read my electric meter every day. The 20 minutes the toaster oven was on , burning my food, my revolutions on my meter went up from 4.95 revolutions to 5.19... This thing is NOT energy efficient. Second. I put 4 hot dogs in for dinner for 10 minutes. The heat was sooooo hot, it Burnt the bottoms of the hot dogs, yet, did not \"cook\" them. after 10 more minutes... I had crusty, burnt hot dogs which were still raw. It is NOT heat distributed nor temperature controlled.  My Oster was really nice, but, after 3 months the TIMER went \"whacko\" and I could not set the timer to cook my food...\n ", "\n  We will need to return the toaster.  The actual oven is truly tiny.  The recipe booklet that came with the toaster must be for a larger toaster. We had hoped to use the oven to bake two personal pot pies, but the second pie was not even close to fitting due to insufficient depth and width.  In addition, the top element is situated in such a way that it reduces the available height of the oven.  Can you recommend a model that has a larger functional oven space?\n \n  We finally used the oven today.  Toast in the morning with no problem following instruction booklet then reheated frozen smoked pizza; oven was perfect for both, just watch your toast.  We left rack at lowest position so flipped toast after checking for doneness.  Pizza was in tray at lowest position for 13 min and thawed pizza was perfectly crusty and melted.  Hope it continues to perform, oh and it didn't heat the kitchen!  We bought it to use in our sticks and bricks home but ultimately is to use in our Airstream during hot summer camping trips for cookies, etc and at only 1100 amps, that can be handled easily by our stock inverter!!\n \n  I read so many positive reviews, I thought I was getting a toaster oven to end all toaster ovens. \n  I mostly bought the Mueller 1100w Ultratemp Toaster Oven because it is advertised as being \"specially designed for even toasting of up to 4 slices of bread\", and I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, I have found the toaster function to be extremely inferior to other toaster ovens by other manufacturers (most of which are not great to begin with). The instructions with the Mueller oven do not even recommend a temperature setting for toast, so I experimented at between 350 - 450 degrees (most often recommended by other manufacturers). The \"light\", \"medium\" and \"dark\" settings on the \"Time\" dial are useless and have no relevance to the way the bread will actually toast.  The \"Broil\" and \"Bake\" functions seem to be reasonably good, but certainly no better than many basic models that are less expensive than this one.\n \n  I was excited to obtain this toaster as it was the right color and price point for what I will want to do with it, which is mostly toast.  it seems that my family and I go through a toaster oven every few years and because of that, we didn't want to spend a lot.  I like the simplicity of this model as well as its size- it fits nicely on our countertop and won't collect crumbs all over the place like ordinary toasters do.  it's important, I suppose, to make sure that you follow their directions before you use it for the first time- I have done that and all was easy to touch and use- timer, toast and it clearly conducted heat from both top and bottom coils. I am excited to use this toaster oven and if anything changes, I will certainly post.\n \n  *UPDATE AS OF 7/29/2020* \n  I was glad to see the small size since I didn't want a big appliance taking up more room than I wanted.  It has just one rack which is fine, and holds 4 slices of bread or a 9\" pizza.  I can do a small pan of brownies or cake.  It looks well built, so I am hopeful it will last.  One problem is the small type at the knobs, but I am getting used to where to set them.  Very happy with my purchase (even though UPS delivered it to my neighbor, but he brought it to me!).\n \n  After trying at least three other brands over the years, I have finally found a winner!! This toaster oven is power packed and is very well built as well as looks great on my counter. It arrived on time and well packaged. I also appreciated the easy to read manual and recipe book that came with this oven. I also love that I can warm up a couple slices of pizza or some turnovers and can do it quickly and without having to heat up my entire kitchen to do it! (I never use the microwave) I\u2019m very satisfied with this purchase!\n \n  I normally trust the reviews from Amazon customers. This time I feel that they got it wrong. This toaster is not cheap. We use our toaster over a lot because we do not have a microwave.so it is an important purchase. The bottom tray does not come out so you can clean it. It toasts on the bottom only and hardly the top. Crumbs continually fall out on my counter from the inside. I am keeping it because in the grand scheme of things, it does the job. This is my first world problem. My suggestion is get another one. :)\n \n  Bought this for our  Airbnb casita and it fits the bill perfectly because of it's compact exterior size.  All the  while still holding as much as the previous toaster oven we had which was at least 30% larger exterior.  And it looks sharp too.\n ", "\n  This is an unsafe and really terrible toaster over.  The top end of the glass door has metal that gets hot and will burn your knuckle if it touches as you open the door, I did day one.  If you want to toast something you have to set the temp, no idea why and they don\u2019t tell you what temp to set toaster had to check other review on Amazon.  Bake function is terrible, want to cook a pizza good luck melting the cheese, it just cools the bottom.  This is such a terrible product\n \n  I was shocked when I got this toaster. I had searched for a toaster oven that would hold 4 slices of bread and had a clean out tray. It did not have either of these options. It was an Amazon \"recommended\" item. I will truthfully say I never used it so I can't really rate the 3 areas of use, but I had to choose something. It is going back and I have ordered a different brand that I have to wait weeks for. The strange thing was when I searched again, after receiving the toaster for the model I bought, it was no longer available!\n \n  Well, I was looking for a compact toaster oven that I could use to bake and toast.  This oven has a couple of problems, one it isn\u2019t east to clean (no removable tray at the bottom) and if not cleaned after each use it smokes, setting off my fire alarm.  Two it does not toast evenly which surprised me, as most toaster ovens do at least toast more than one strip.\n \n  This cooks pretty easily, and doesn't cook the house the way the main oven does. It can be a little hard to adapt recipes to use it, though. Not everything cooks the way it does in a normal oven. \n  total waste of money, the thermostat does cut on/off ok, although the temperature control is way off .. gets ~ 30F hotter than the dial setting... (use a quality interior oven thermometer to set this thing.. I had it set 325F-350F, it was getting to 400F inside).. but WORST, the OUTSIDE gets so ridiculous HOT that will start a fire on your countertop..  you cannot touch the top, sides, or even the front of this hunk of junk, and the countertop underneath gets hot too.. I pity the family with children who puts this junk in the kitchen,, it will scorch or set to fire most thing people might set on top of it without realizing how DANGEROUS this thing is.. BEWARE\n \n  I really wanted to like this toaster oven, based on all the reviews, but I use the toast feature most often and the light medium and dark settings just didn't work, so I've been forced to stand and watch it make toast so it doesn't burn. During my busy mornings, that doesn't work for me. I do like the oven features, but refuse to buy a toaster oven and a toaster. Kind of defeats the purpose of a toaster oven, toaster and oven all in one. If it doesn't make toast as well as the oven features, it shouldn't be labeled a toaster oven. Unfortunately I am returning it.\n \n  A well-designed timer that allows you to precisely time your meal or you can just choose to leave the toaster oven on without using the timing device. Heating elements are not exposed. The best part about it is that it is extremely easy to clean it!!! My kids love the cookies that I made in this toaster oven and I can tell that baking cookies was never easier. This toaster oven fits perfectly in our small kitchen and looks very good in it. Overall, I think this is a good quality toaster oven, great value. I simply enjoy it. Great buy.\n \n  Bought this toaster oven to replace my 4 slice toaster that is on its way out. It arrived today well packed with a great manual and a recipe book. Cleaned it as instructed and ran empty for the first time. Has bake, broil, and toast features as well as a timer and adjustable temp control from 150 to 450 degrees. Well built with a clean look. Has an easy access crumb tray for cleaning. Very happy with this purchase.\n \n  The oven is lightweight and I had doubts about its efficiency, but it works great for toasting muffins, much better than the stove broiler.  I like the range of temperature settings and the rotary timer is superb.  I prefer the analog controls to digital ones.  It is better than heating up the entire kitchen with the stove.  It's also great for melting cheese on sandwiches.\n \n  This is an amazing little toaster oven! What\u2019s not to love?? It shipped quickly and arrived very well packaged. The size is perfect for us. It toasts 4 slices of bread evenly & to perfection. It cooks personal sized pizzas (9 inches or less). Clean up is easy and the crumb tray is a great help. It\u2019s very sleek & stylish looking. The price point is more than reasonable, in fact, it\u2019s a great deal! I would absolutely recommend this product!\n ", "\n  I have needed a new toaster oven for a while now. My old (big brand) one has started making weird noises and the timer stopped working. After researching different brands and reading reviews I went with this one. May I say, I am glad I did. Its super sleek design and compact size sits great on my kitchen counter top. So far I have made toast and pizza on a tortilla. Both came out with great results! It definitely runs a lot smoother than my old one too.  I am excited to use this on a daily basis.\n \n  2nd UPDATE: The company honored their warranty it\u2019s no questions ask. They were very apologetic and communicative, which I appreciate. (Not always the case.) They replaced this item with no additional fees. It\u2019s nice to do business with a smaller company that values their clients. \n  This is a small oven, good if you have limited space. What I like about this oven is that the heating elements have a metal guard to shield from melted cheese and crumbs landing on them. This oven toasts quickly so you will have to watch it and experiment with the temperature settings. For me, this is not a problem. This little oven heats up fast. So far, I've only used it for toast and heating up leftover pizza. The crumb tray doesn't come out. There is a knob on the bottom which opens up but stays attached to the appliance. You may have to tilt the toaster up to clean it properly.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. My old Waring Pro died after 8 years and I could not find one that was exactly like it. When I found this one, I thought I\u2019d give it a try. It exceeds expectations. It looks great in my kitchen and operates easily. So far everything I\u2019ve made in it, dinners, reheating, toasting, has been perfect. I live in Florida, and use my large oven only a few times a year! This oven is large enough to fit even my Corning wear baking dishes.\n \n  I don't like leaving a negative comment but this oven's temperature control is unreliable.  The heating coils never turn off even after correct temp has been reached which results in overdone/burned bottom.  I would return but the time has expired to do that.  The interior is a nice size so that gets the one star but I am very sorry to have made this my choice.\n \n  This toaster is awesome!!!  The European design is really awesome and this toaster works very well.  It is very easy to use and you have a lot of control over all the settings.  The bell that dings after the timer is finished is loud enough to hear across the average size house.  I bought, of all things, a french press from the same company a while back and it has also performed flawlessly so I thought I would take a chance on a toaster oven and so far I am impressed with the build and quality of both.  I recommend this toaster to anyone looking for a toaster in this class. I hope you enjoy.\n \n  I\u2019ve been looking for a small toaster oven for a short while and narrowed in over Mueller. Arrived timely and packed well. Started with toasting bread to try out the heat settings and distribution which came out well. Next up was a pizza and it very well lived up to my expectation. So far I\u2019ve enjoyed using it and seems to doing the job well. It is light body and fits pretty much anywhere in the kitchen. Heats up quickly too so two thumbs up for this toaster oven.\n \n  I've had this oven for about a year and its worked well for general toasting. \n  my toaster over which i had for years finally gave up.  I searched and searched, and finally found the one i wanted.  it is the perfect size, affordable, and seems very well made.  I have used it a couple of times so far, from everything to toast, to cooking some fish - no issues at all.  I am in the housewares business, and have heard about this brand for a long time, and now happy I tried them out!\n \n  I ordered Vegetable Slicer and was surprised by the quality of this brand, so I ordered this oven toaster one week ago. Finally I got it today. The size is not so big (4-slides), the design has good taste. Unfortunately, the heating element was broken, so sad, have to return it.\n ", "\n  There are no clear instructions. For toasting you set a temperature, select toast, and select time to toast. The timer doesn't always stop at off. The crumb tray does not come completely out. I prefer being able to shake out tray directly into the trash can. Looks really nice. Overall it seems to be a good toaster over. I like the tray provided for baking.  I have not had any issues with the door not staying closed as posted in other reviews.\n \n  I have only used this about 6 times now and the door hinge that keeps the door closed, pulls it shut, is malfunctioning. The overall appearance and simplicity is nice, but on bake, when doing brown n serve rolls, the bottoms burn before the tops brown, so the heat distribution must not be proper. I like the size but am disappointed with the door hinge and heating distribution.\n \n  Terrible , just got this for 3 weeks , oven door ruined, hinge not keeping door up. \n  I live alone and do not like to heat up my big oven to heat up the small meals I buy.  This toaster oven is ideal for my needs. It fits nicely on my counter, heats up in minutes and cooks evenly. The package was perfect and survived shipping. \n  I've only had this oven for about a week, and might not have as of yet figured out all the controls.  But I have used it for Toast, English muffins, Chicken Shake n Bake and Pork Shake n Bake.  All have come out fine, except the English were a little under cooked, and I could not figure a way to extend the time.  All and all, good results which I expect will get better with time as I get things figured out. \n  What I didn\u2019t like is you can\u2019t line with aluminum foil so terrible to clean as no tray to pull out. No top heating elements either.\n \n  A very small volume, which does not allow you to cook more overall than a couple of pieces of bread. A very rough time setting, an error of + -3 minutes, which makes you stand on duty at the toaster, if you need to fry the bread. The smoke coming from under the control knobs is extremely annoying (with numerous regular openings). Lack of tray to remove crumbs.\n \n  I like my purchase of this toaster oven! It is a little bigger than I expected, but it's worth it because of all that it does. My normal microwave is broken and annoying, so that is why I bought this so it can replace my toaster and also can double as an oven, making it easier on me. Super happy with my decision!\n \n  I needed a toaster oven without spending over $100, NOT made in China...while this toaster fit both of those requirements, it failed nearly every other point. \n  I was thrilled to receive this little toaster oven in such a timely manner. It was packaged well, no chance of damage. Because of the extremely hot weather in my area, I have not used the oven, just plugged it in to see if it works. The controls are easy to figure out, and it passed the plug-in test. It looks to be a good substitution for my electric stove's oven, which is off-putting because of the electricity it requires. I'll write more after I've used it, but I'm very pleased so far.\n ", "\n  This toaster oven is a smaller version of the one I currently have. It is definitely big enough to do any sort of toaster oven needs. The settings are all similar in terms of the options, temperatures, and timer. The tray is a bit flimsy but I don't think there is really a need for it to be any sturdier. You can also place your item straight on the rack. I do think this is a better option because of versatility than a standard toaster.\n \n  Love it! It\u2019s compact enough to fit in my tiny kitchen which is a struggle. Though it\u2019s compact it still has enough space to cook a decent amount of things. It works great and it\u2019s super simple to use. I\u2019m forgetful and tend to burn things in my oven so this toaster oven is great because it has a timer! Never again will i destroy my mozzarella sticks! Also they include a recipe book with what seems to be some yummy recipes, I\u2019m excited to try them out.\n \n  We can't see why this has such positive reviews. To toast something you first have to set a temperature, then select toast, then set a timer but the timer for toasting is just a small section of a much longer timer so you really are just guessing and must watch your item to make sure it doesn't burn. The difference between light and dark is miniscule. Our old cuisinart toaster oven was much easier to use.\n \n  I purchased this because I needed a small oven so I didn\u2019t have to keep using the big oven for every little thing.  This takes up little space and doesn\u2019t look bulky at all.  I have other mueller products and I expected this to be the same - it did not disappoint.  I haven\u2019t used it all that much but for the ones I have, the outcome was great!\n \n  The toaster seems ok, but I hate being lied to. Made in PRC is the company way of hiding the fact the unit is made in China. They just need to tell the truth. Therefore the one star rating. Muller just tell the truth\n \n  We purchased this oven to replace another that had died. Everything was great, until we turned it on and the unit heated up. The way the handle is placed, when you open the front door the top metal piece running horizontally across the top of the gass, hits the top of your fingers and knuckles, AND IT IS HOT HOT HOT! One pretty bad burn later... Unfortunately we are requesting a return & refund for this item.\n \n  Three major/minor observation.... \n  Very attractive toaster oven with the right price...it cooks and toasts fairly well. Has mechanisms that make cleaning easy. \n  Can't regulate toasting or cooking.  Toast is eather burned or not toasted on one side. \n  The first one did not work. Sent it back and received a replacement. The second one lasted a year and a half. Smoke started coming out of the control panel so I threw out. When oven is on it only heats from the bottom so the bottom of everything is burned and the top is cold. It takes forever to toast anything. Bottom tray does not slide out so you have to hold the entire oven over the garbage to empty it.\n ", "\n  Our Zojirushi toaster oven stopped working after eight years and we decided to give this model a try after reading good reviews.  It has an appealing modern design and heats up very quickly.  It takes about the same footprint as our last toaster but surprisingly it has a larger capacity.  Choice of rack height is also a plus.  We love it and hope it will last long.\n \n  I got this a while back ago. I am just now doing the review because I wanted to use it for a while so my review actually count for something. Is being a while over 3 months and the whole time this toaster oven has been great. Is very practical, easy to clean and it fits just fine on my kitchen counter. I recommend it, is a great oven.\n \n  I received my oven and it does not work at all. The heat element does not work. We have tried everything. It took forever to get here and now I am having to send this one back and wait for the new one.\n \n  Good interior space; good insulation. \n  This thing is smaller than a shoe box.  I bought it because of the great reviews but I was very disappointed when I got it.  The box looked tiny and after I removed it from the packing I couldn't believe how small it was.  My old toaster wasn't huge but it had way more room on the inside. \n  It works great for bagels, slices of pizza, etc. Heats up very quickly. Just be careful to not store anything on / around it. \n  We had a bigger counter top over when the kids still lived at home, but now have found this one to be perfect for the just the 2 of us.  The timer feature is really great, as mine larger one had that as well, and it is a great feature.  The only the negative thing I have to say is that the tray is shallow and it has been hard to find a large enough one that is deeper.  But, not necessarily a deal-breaker, I use a cake pan and make it work.\n \n  This toaster is great. I have one major problem. When it was assembled the wiring between the Broil/Bake mode got reversed. So basically... broil setting is actually bake(lower element turns on)  and Bake settings is actually Broil(upper element)  Normally I would have returned it, but I can remember to use the proper setting for now.  I might open it up someday and switch the wire so that  the unit responds according to the correct knob selection .\n \n  Excellent product - sturdy and well made.  Makes great toast and has a good range of temperature settings.  I like the fact that there is are separate temperature, timer, and setting controls.  Also large enough for smaller baking pans so there are numerous uses for this toaster oven.  Would definitely recommend this item.\n \n  Not only does this oven look good, it's incredibly easy to setup and learn how to use. Excellent instructions! Had it ready to go in less than 20 minutes (and that included a thorough washing of the components). Heats up fast too. Especially like the large window, makes  it easy to watch the progress without letting out heat. The size is great too because it doesn't take up lots of counter space but holds relatively large items. And it's light weight. Love it!\n ", "\n  I just received it yesterday so 3 stars is all I can give until I use it for awhile. \n  I've bought other Mueller products before and have been pleased with the quality and workmanship. This one is no exception. I'm very pleased with my purchase.\n \n  This toaster oven may be small, but it works very well!  I like the compact size since I have very little counter space, and it doesn't get super hot on the outside like some toaster ovens I've had in the past.  All the foods I've made in it so far have come out perfectly and it seems to heat evenly.  My only complaint is that the knobs can be hard to read accurately.  I ended up drawing a line down the side with a marker so I can better see what setting I'm actually on.\n \n  My family uses toaster oven's for making toast a lot.  There's no dedicated timer knob for the toast functionality, so it's *real* difficult to set the timer to the right length for toasting.  And then after a couple weeks of use whatever spring or latch used to hold the door closed disappeared, so now something has to be wedged against the outside of the door while in use to keep it closed.  I'd recommend shopping for something else (as I'm about to do now).\n \n  We ordered this and the door broke within 2 weeks. We had the unit replaced and the new one had a crooked door right out of the box. Not sure that's it's worth trying a 3rd one. I'll be calling the company.\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size for my space! I found it to be easy to operate and works well! I had a little trouble at first with the toasting feature: you have to set it to toast and then pick a temperature before it begins toasting. I was not aware of this at first, but if you crank the temperature knob all the way up and then move the other knob to toast - it works great!\n \n  I love this toaster oven!! It is so lightweight and smaller than the average microwave. I did not expect it to heat up so fast, if you have kids I would suggest keep out of reach because the outside of the toaster oven does heat up. It has a timer feature so you don\u2019t have to worry about missing the time and it keeps your food warm if you put it on the setting. I can see myself taking this for Airbnb travels that do not have stoves.\n \n  I used my new Mueller toaster oven toay and it toasts so quickly, I was delighted and surprised.  So far...so good!I \n  Worst crap ever. We just needed  a reliable \"toaster\" oven. Stay away. It dosen't work as stated at all. If you simply want \"toast\" you have to flip your bread. Ours is listed on Mercari for $10 if anyone is interested. Would have returned it but I'm a nurse and haven't had much time to post reviewsor pay attention to time lately. Anyone want it for free? Disgusting. DO NOT BUY!\n \n  Have had the Mueller less than 1 1/2 yrs & absolutely loved it. However, started having problems with the door when it was less than 1 yr old. It was slightly ajar when cooking. Today the door hinge just fell apart & it\u2019s no longer useable. It\u2019s very disappointing considering my last one (a different brand), lasted close to 10 yrs. I rarely used this Mueller (less than 1 x week) & expected it to last at least a couple of years. It\u2019s really not worth the $ when there are cheaper brands out there that don\u2019t fall apart so easily.\n ", "\n  This toaster oven was exactly what I was looking for. I have limited counter space and was replacing a regular toaster. While this is slightly bigger than my toaster it does not eat up a lot of space and works great!!! I can do many more things in here than a regular toaster and it did not break the budget!\n \n  This toaster oven doesn\u2019t have a removable crumb tray to clean out. It\u2019s very difficult to clean.  Did not figure this out until after the return window. Otherwise decent toaster.\n \n  Another purchase for our camper and its size is perfect. It sits on our dinet table right against the wall and doesnt take up any needed space. It also does produce a lot of exterrior heat that would damage our wallpaper and table top (like pur old school toaster did). Highly recommend\n \n  This toaster oven was exactly what we were looking for.  It is lightweight (especially for its size) and has a modern, sleek look - it does not look bulky on the countertop and easily wipes clean.  It is very easy to use the temperature controls to adjust to a uniform toast at the desired amount.  The heat is also distributed evenly and disburses efficiently; we have no issues with the cabinets above the toaster getting hot.  We have mainly used it to toast bread products so far but it has plenty of options to use for other products.  We chose this product based on the overall reviews and definitely feel like we got a great value product, especially for the price.\n \n  Several things about this oven are problematic.  First, several surfaces including the top and door get extremely hot during operation to the point that they will severely burn your hand if touched directly.  Second, the timer is an egg timer so it is very approximate.  Finally, the crumb tray cannot be removed without flipping the whole unit on its back to unlatch the bottom.  I do not recommend this unit especially because of the first point which makes it extremely dangerous to operate.\n \n  I just got it out of the box today but I\u2019m totally psyched.  it\u2019s on the smaller side very cute stainless steel and glass.  has a wire rack with a baking sheet.  And I turned on the timer for heavy toast and the whole thing lit up Orange red all throughout the inside so I know I\u2019m gonna be happy with it!\n \n  The soggy feeling you get when you heat leftovers is a thing of the past when I use the Mueller convection oven to heat those leftovers. I'm able to enjoy them almost as crispy and delicious as they were and the leftovers do end up tasting about the same as they did when they came out of the big oven from the first time. I would recommend it completely for heating leftovers and cooking small stuff that you don't want to get the oven going for\n \n  Little Powerhouse. I'm very please with this oven. Came well packaged, no dings, or scratches. It's been lest than a week since this arrived. I've bake chicken, a cake, and squash in this oven and everything turned out great. Be careful though. It heats up quickly, and coooks relatively fast. You have to either time whatever you're making, or monitor closely, else it will burn. This is a great addition to any kitchen. Easy cleanup, doesn't heat up the house, and doesn't require a large footprint. Thank you Mueller for a great product.\n \n  A great addition to my kitchen. It\u2019s replaced a 4 slice toaster. Couldn\u2019t wait to try it on my frozen blueberry waffles. Worked perfectly. This toaster oven has a small enough footprint that fits on the counter and looks wonderful. I\u2019ve discovered Mueller products are outstanding. Highly recommended\n \n  Be Ready For It!\n ", "\n  Others gave this unit good reviews, and I am glad I listened. It's a beautiful and compact little toaster oven; fits on our narrow countertop. Design is quite nice and love the big window. Heats evenly and effectively, and I love the timer to remind you to check on your cooking. Really a nice product!!\n \n  I would not recommend it ever and never. After four (4) month the handle is broken. \n  Worked fine for about a year and then the BAKE function stopped working.  It's not the bulb because it works fine on the other settings.\n \n  This oven was great for about 6 weeks, then the toaster only worked in the back part of the oven.  Then I had to manually turn the bread over and push toast again at it would only toast on one side.  Then it wasn't worth using as a toaster any more and that is why I bought it.  I really liked the convection oven function, but that didn't last long.  It quit on my this past week, where it doesn't heat at all.  It was a great  idea, but seems like they didn't build it to last long.  I was using the toaster every morning and the oven once or twice a week, so it didn't get burned out from use!!!  Too bad, but don't buy.  It's heading for the trash.\n \n  Need to update my old toaster oven and was very pleased when I saw this one.  I have a guest house with a small kitchen and this toaster over really looks nice on the kitchen counter.  It works really well for toast and reheating leftovers, such as pizza and evening meals.  I like the stainless steel design of it and it is easy to keep clean.  I would recommend this handsome oven for anyone one looking to update and furnish their kitchen.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Broken door after using it for a week\n \n  I purchased this oven for my son who is in college. The compact size fits great on his counter and he can cook small meals without using the large oven.  After being back in school for less than a week he's cooked a calzone, chicken tenders, and of course cookies!  Both he and his roommate love the oven.\n \n  Since I basically only use it for making toast, it is overkill for me.  The control for making toast is too imprecise.  The handle for turning the toaster on is too small, settings are too small to see so I'm basically 'guessing' every time I turn the knob hoping it comes out right.  I'm sure it is fine for more difficult things than making toast.  My fault, I should have researched it better.\n \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven 4 Slice, Multi-function Stainless Steel with Timer - Toast - Bake - Broil Settings, Natural Convection - 1100 Watt --is a great addition to our kitchen. It is much more powerful than our previous entry level \n  Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She is a trucker with one of those trucks that you have a compartment you can live in. She wanted to be able to bake things so I got this for her and she loves it. She baked cookies and other things and it working out very well for her.\n ", "\n  We have had this toaster for about 2 months now and love it! It's a great size, stylish appearance and does a great job toasting and baking! I thought I was not going to like the fact that the tray does not pull out w the door but we are totally used to it...no problems! I wish there was a crumb tray that you could pull out to clean easier but the stylish look, sturdy construction, even cooking and great price make up for it!\n \n  Very pleased with the size of this. My previous toaster was big and clunky but this doesn\u2019t look uneasy on the eyes while it sits on the kitchen counter. Not to mention, it has double the amount of watt power than my old one. Perfect amount of space inside to make a decently sized meal and the increase in watt power cuts cooking time! Very versatile and perfect when you\u2019re baking something small so you won\u2019t need to heat up your whole oven.\n \n  We haven't cooked a whole chicken in this oven yet, but the air fryer Does cook things Quickly, so don't Overcook at a high temp!  My son Loves it!  Good gift for wedding gifts, or young people who have moved away from home, or even for us old folks!  Everybody here Loves it!!!\n \n  Make sure you do a burn threw at first.. Mine smokes a bit. Other then that it works well for the first time... Im happy\n \n  This toaster oven is not one to have in your home.  The settings around the control knobs are pictures too small to see, too tiny to even read up close which is ridiculous.  The rack inside is totally challenging to position.  And sometimes the oven just heated inconsistently.  Our mistake was trying to acclimate to this and not returning it in time.  We learned.  DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN!!\n \n  you definitely have to let the chemical unboxing smell burn out for a while before use because it was a bit overwhelming but after we got rid of that it has worked wonderfully and we love having an easier way to bake small things that doesn\u2019t heat up the entire house!\n \n  This is a great product for our needs. I wanted something to bake in because out little trailer didn\u2019t have an oven. This fits the bill perfectly!\n \n  This toaster oven is not good for people who are getting old and having vision problems. I couldn\u2019t see the baking temperature without turning all the lights on in the kitchen and putting on my reading glasses. The thin black lettering on the stainless steel is probably inadequate for anyone over 20! Even after thinking I\u2019d conquered the temperature I burnt the only thing I tried to bake in it.\n \n  Efficient. Compact and easy to use. Mueller products are always high quality and their customer service seems to be very engaged. My kids use this little toaster everyday with no issues. Not expensive so I don\u2019t worry about what they cook \ud83e\udd23. Happy with my purchase!\n \n  I got this as a replacement for my old toaster oven, and I am very pleased with how nice it looks. I love the chrome finish; it looks like it's made out of high end materials. It also toasts everything perfectly. It took a little to figure out the right times for different things. I don't like my toast to be super dark and I guess it just depends on how toasted you like your food. I love having a warm sandwich with melted cheese in the morning. I am usually rushing out of the house, but at least I can count on a decent meal on my way to work. I just let the oven do its thing while I get ready and after the beep, I'm out the door.\n ", "\n  Pros \n  Love this oven. It\u2019s large enough to make dinner for two without heating up the kitchen. It\u2019s beautifully designed and looks great on the counter. I use it everyday foe everything from brownies to roasts. The temperature is extremely accurate so there is no guessing with baking times. I would highly recommend his toaster oven.\n \n  I've had this oven for almost 2 weeks and I am happy with it thus far.  I needed an oven with a small footprint and this one fits my limited counter space beautifully.  I like the features and it looks great. The only disappointment is there is NOT a crumb tray that slides out for cleaning.  My last two toaster oven's had that feature and it sure made it convenient. The bottom of this oven opens up and can be cleaned fairly easily while open so I'm getting used to being without the removable tray.  I've used the oven several times and it has done a good job, even toast comes out pretty uniform. The oven does get very hot so the warnings to wear gloves should be taken seriously.  All in all I'm happy with my purchase.\n \n  Toaster oven works great. However, I had a problem with the door latch. The company's truly helpful and professional customer service sent me another unit. If you buy the unir, I would recommend not opening the door when in operation. I believe the heat from the lower heating element has a negative impact on the door latch.\n \n  Mueller is a great brand and this is a great toaster oven. The oven itself has a very nice and compact design and is very light. The hearing elements get hot quickly and the food is heated/cooked quickly. I have no complaints and would consider buying other Mueller products in the future.\n \n  After reading the instructions, I did not realize need to set a temperature to make toast.  Other toaster ovens do not require to set a temp for making toast. My suggestion for you ... under the \"tips\" on making toast, you should recommend a temperature setting.  Otherwise this is a good product.\n \n  This one toasts way faster than my old one! Nice even color ... just need to be careful on the dial cause I have burned more taco shells than ever before! \n  This is awesome! Mueller is an awesome company, I\u2019ve been slowly purchasing more and more from them. I love, and prefer this oven over my larger oven because it heats up and seems to cook a lot faster, I can have a mini frozen pizza in about 10 minutes as compared to 25-30 in the larger oven due to preheat times. You can also toast, and broil in here, it\u2019s also very affordable.\n \n  The recipients say they love it and was exactly what they wanted.  They don't have to turn on the oven for small items and heat up the room.  Also lessens the chance of their young child getting burned by the oven because he can't get to the counter top.\n \n  I like that this oven is easy to use.  I don't need a digital panel or touch screen to make toast! ", "\n  It seems week made- no rough edges. Thought it was made in Austria- but not- it\u2019s made in China... so it is pricey for a toaster for just our purpose of primarily just making toast. This is an elaborate toaster that can be used for small pizzas, etc...\n \n  Update: 8/12/2020 \n  I just got it and am in love! We got it for our RV. I have used it more times than I have used the actual oven in the RV. It's the perfect size and easy to clean too. My kids love cheese toast and my husband and I like to roast veggies in it. I am thinking about getting another for our house too. Great price too!\n \n  Heating up yesterday's pizza in the toaster oven is the best. I hate how the microwave makes everything soggy, this oven makes pizza taste even better the next day. I toast all my sandwiches in there now, it makes a big difference in taste when you have melted cheese. Using the regular oven is a huge pain since I often forget my food, or the oven is too powerful when I need to heat up something small. Without using so much electricity this toaster oven does a great job. The best part is the automatic shut off and the little ding when the food is done.\n \n  The bottom knob that selects \u201cStay on\u201d or \u201ctoast timer\u201d is too hard to turn. I have to use a silicone gripper to turn the dial. \n  Absolutely love our new toaster oven. Easy to clean and perfect for almost anything you want to toast, bake and broil.  It\u2019s the perfect size too!  The old toaster oven is not a good as this new toaster oven. It\u2019s evenly distributes heat to make sure you get the perfect toast on each side. I\u2019ve cooked some cookies and potato skins too!. I am happy with this toaster oven and might get one for my mom and dad too!  It\u2019s a definite must buy for anyone!\n \n  So far I am very pleased with the operation of this toaster oven. The three controls are very clear and easy to use.  Although I have yet to use the broiler, the toasting and heating functions work very well. I highly recommend this toaster oven.\n \n  I enjoy this toaster oven so much. It does so many functions and cooks so many different types of foods. I cooked sausage in it, that I usually put in my air fryer, but it came out better in the toaster oven! It's pretty easy to use and I like the wide temperature range. The food I've cooked so far cooks very evenly. The detachable oven bottom makes it easy to clean.\n \n  I have had the same toaster over for almost a decade and it was time to upgrade to a newer and more innovative appliance. The heat on this oven is stronger than in my old beat up one and it takes half of the time to toast my bread in the morning for breakfast. I love how roomie it is and yet it takes the same amount of space on my counter top. Great purchase and you should get one as well!\n \n  claims \u201ceven heating\u201d but only toasts the part that is right above the heating bar. The oven even stopped working mupltiple times while plugged in and ticking. Got rid of the thing in 2 weeks. Went to kohl\u2019s instead\n ", "\n  I love it I love it! Perfect addition to the kitchen, I had been using my oven to bake and broil as I love to cook - but I have been in the market for a toaster for a while and finally decided on this one. It has exceeded my expectations to say the least. Directions were quick and the device is super easy to use - even for those who have trouble with tech like me.  I have been using it to broil my english muffins for breakfast and it is easy to evaluate the best temperature to use and when the food is done. For the price, I am genuinely impressed. Fantastic product.\n \n  Returned never refunded after shipped. It is a pretty little stove but slove to cook or toast  anything. 6-7 minutes just for a slice of toast after many turns and settings. Get a toaster only, this oven is probably good if you don\u2019t have an oven.\n \n  Uneven heating on all settings. Made garlic toast, some were soft and some were burnt to a crisp. All toast needs to be flipped on toast settings. Barely used and had for just under 3 months, one of the most terrible purchases I ever made. Way past return date:( \n  I hate turning on my actual oven since it usually makes my entire apartment super hot and wanted to get a toaster oven that I could actually use to cook food in and not just warm up leftovers and this one fits the bill. I can cook my personal pizza and also toast and other things that I don't want to waste my time with the oven. I also tried it to cook potatoes and it worked great for that too!\n \n  This toaster oven makes perfect toast.  I love that I can reheat single serving left overs quickly and much better than in the microwave or needing to wait for the kitchen oven to come to temperature.  It looks great on my counter top too!\n \n  Loved how quickly is was shipped!! Also there are options to pick toast, broil, and bake.\n \n  Great toaster oven! Small enough for our small counter, easy to unpack, very sleek looking and we already made cookies in it! Plus my 11 year old can make mini frozen pizzas without heating up the whole kitchen in summer using the oven!\n \n  Looks good, cleans easily but I still haven\u2019t worked out the setting I need to put it on so I don\u2019t burn my rolls or biscuits on the bottom. That\u2019s a sticking point with me. The company I bought it from was great and I received it in a timely manner. I might not order this particular item again but I would buy from the company.\n \n  This toaster oven is the perfect size, it doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter.  We cook English muffins in the oven, it takes 10 minutes @ 350 degrees, they are perfectly cooked.  We will cook many other foods, we have had for about a week.\n \n  It is very small. Doesn\u2019t heat evenly. To clean  Bottom comes off with a struggle. And it\u2019s made with very thin metal slices my fingers every time. Deep too.  Not happy\n ", "\n  If you want to use this toaster oven to toast toast, this is not the toaster oven for you. This is more for a small oven on the countertop use. \n  A bit flimsy. If you try and remove something like a chicken breast with a fork the rack will collapse and fall down to the bottom under the pressure of a simple fork. Natural convection?!  Ha!  By their definition, every toaster oven has \"Natural convection\". There is no fan in it it's just heat rising. The two-element design makes it hard to toast bread without a streak through the bread where the element is above.  It is not easy to clean and the bottom is hard to keep in. I would buy something else.\n \n  The onion shopper pro was to easy for used I opened clean and used for the breakfast  rigth now, and have more carriots for the super. The toaster oven, really make a great dark toasted and medium farm, italian bread and muffins english\n \n  Copy your review here: Great toaster oven. Looks nice & toasted well. Arrived on time and packaged well!  Better quality than what was available in our local stores.  Definitely recommend this if your considering it as a purchase.\n \n  As far as normal operations for the price you can't beat this.  I had to dock a star because the handle broke less than 2 months after we purchased so now only one side is attached and I have to constantly try to glue the other side.  For the price I guess that's what you get.\n \n  Once I learned how to convert oven instructions to toaster oven instructions, using the toaster oven became easy. It replaces me having to start up my oven for small things like reheating food. My whole family uses it now and we don\u2019t heat up the whole kitchen just to warm up a slice a pizza. This beats microwaving which results in soggy food.\n \n  I just luv my little toaster oven so far! I find it easy to program and the size is perfect for my needs! I've made pizza, bacon, and toast so far and it turned out great! I recommend this for anyone who wants a nice basic toaster oven.\n \n  I absolutely love this toaster oven. It\u2019s just the right size to not take up too much room but big enough to get the job done! Everything is coming out just right so I will definitely purchase from Mueller again!!! The oven is well made and sturdy and matches my kitchen appliances perfectly. If you are on the fence about this product, don\u2019t be, you\u2019ll be more than happy with this toaster oven.\n \n  Nice little toaster oven for those with not a lot of counter space. it comfortably holds a frozen pizza or 2 pieces of toast or 3 English muffins. I've also roasted veggies in it. Good small machine but can do what you need and more. toasting, baking, broiling, etc. i use it almost everyday and it warms up very fast!\n \n  I have never owned a toaster oven and thought this would help with energy costs this winter.  I used to cook for a living and thought this toaster oven would take forever to warm up, but it is fast!  I also liked the cook book that is included.  The few things that annoy me is first off, the timer makes a loud clicking noise until it goes off, like an old alarm clock.  The other thing is the crumb tray is hard to remove, it doesn't just slide out.  No big deal though.  I highly recommend this toaster oven.  It looks nice on my counter.\n ", "\n  So far I like the toaster. What I don\u2019t care for, and why only 4 starts, is how long it takes to toast a piece of bread and how it\u2019s still uneven. I ended up putting the rack on the top slot so the bread wouldn\u2019t  burn. The dial is wrong as well as for toasting light, medium, or dark. I have to do past dark every time, even with the temp all the way up to 450 just for a normal toast. And it still takes almost 5 minutes just to toast a piece of bread.\n \n  It is smaller than my old one but it's ok for a single person pursuing a minimal life. I just want to have one more pan for putting it under a baking rack so that I can have grill marks on my salmon or meat and greasy oil would be dripped onto the pan. However, while writing this review, I had brainstorm. I went to the kitchen and wrapped a rack underneath with aluminum foil. Voila!\n \n  There is no way to clean this oven Because the trade does not slide out it is attached to the toaster oven and I was not expecting that. The temperature is not accurate and it is smaller than I thought it would be But I should\u2019ve looked better at the size of the description.\n \n  This toaster oven has a very nice compact design and works great to toast and warm my foods.  I love it!  The window on the front of the toaster oven is clear and it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on with the food inside.  The controls are easy to use and understand too.\n \n  I set to put the crumb catcher down, but it doesn't go on the bottom!  There is no removable crumb catcher and the heating unit blocks the rear of the unit.  I packed it back up and sent it back!\n \n  We've just begun using our Mueller toaster oven.  Initial reactions from the household are positive.  It's a little smaller than the one we replaced but doesn't seem to affect our usage.  We miss having a crumb tray but like the cleaning door on the bottom.  The controls work well and are easy to learn.  The oven heats up quickly.  Perhaps the nicest surprise is that it actually toasts bread!  Several of its predecessors weren't very good at that.  Overall we're pretty pleased after a week of use.\n \n  Smart looking, and more than adequate for my needs. No point in a bigger unit that would duplicate what already available in a standard oven. Great especially for reheating leftovers or for heating hunks of bread or rolls that wouldn\u2019t fit in a standard toaster. Only minor complaint: the instruction manual says the crumb tray is removable for cleaning. It is not, though it is accessible for cleaning by turning the toaster oven on its back (it\u2019s very light).\n \n  This toaster oven is perfect. I hated my previous one, it always took too long to cook simple food, would get dirty and disgusting really easily and burn half of my toast and the other half would be cold, but this one can even broil food correctly. I live alone, so this makes it easier to cook for myself and keep my electricity bill low, which always helps!\n \n  Exactly as advertised. Very sturdy and well made. Works flawlessly.\n \n  The first and only time I used it (to make toast), the unit\u2019s burner element caught fire from crumbs that had fallen upon it. I glanced over and saw flames.\n ", "\n  The toaster worked fine for the first two months but 2 weeks after that, the door handle broke. I am quite disappointed. The door will no longer stay closed I have to prop it up with something to continue using it. I kept it in the same spot on my counter, cleaned and maintained it regularly, and used it per standard functionality. I also cannot reattach the hinge myself.\n \n  I purchased this toaster oven after reading it's reviews... Although, it does work great & I've been very satisfied with it for the past month since I've had it.. The door will not stay closed, at first I thought there was a magnet somewhere holding it closed, but there isn't! I guess it's just a \"latch\" a the lower left side of the door which looks like it's not connecting to where it's supposed to.  I was going to attempt fixing it myself but am scared I will break it! Needless to say, it does still work & I've been using duct tape to hold it closed...\n \n  Our old Cuisinart toaster oven died and we thought we'd take a chance on a brand we've never used before, and I'm glad we did.  It works perfectly... at first almost too well, as this unit heats up much more quickly than our old one.  We've gotten used to this powerful little oven now, and we're very happy with it!\n \n  cheaply made in china, badly written instructions and cookbook. smells awful for the first two hours despite careful following of instructions and cleaning. the promised free slicer: two sms numbers provided, neither one responsive nor to the email sent to customer service \n  The Mueller Toaster Oven Model MT-175 is a sleek stainless steel treasure! \n  For the price there this is a tremendous value. Why? the difference was the OUTSTANDING technical support I received when I couldn't figure out how to use the timer dial. Yes, I am technically challenged - I admit it! I called the 800 number expecting an automated menu without human contact. However, I was really pleasantly surprised when, within a few rings, a nice man answered the phone with a German or Austrian accent (I think). He was so kind, patient, understanding and thorough.  He emphasized a few times that the product was under warranty and if there was ever and issue to call back and he would help again. I am very pleased to have bought this wonderful Mueller unit and look forward to using it!\n \n  Great small oven for the price. Works just fine for our needs. We have limited counter space and a double oven range, wanted a smaller counter top oven for toast and reheating small quantities of food. This oven works very good. Took me about a week to get the toast to come out just right, now that I have that figured out toast is perfect. Good Buy.\n \n  I gave it a one star for cleaning because I cut myself! I opened the door and was trying to clean the bread crumbs out and accidentally my fingers slid on the metal part of the door and i cut my finger!\n \n  Since we bought this toaster oven, we have used it everyday. It is just my husband and I, so we don't cook a ton of food.  We have made toast, pizza, eggplant parmesan, chicken, etc in this toaster oven.\n \n  This thing works just like a mini oven, you can make pizzas, chicken, shrimp, steak, and you can toast! ", "\n  I like that it is smaller than my previous toaster oven, but it holds the same amount of food. The timer/heat dials are great. Easy to see and set. The heat temperature is accurate. Only downside is cleaning the crumb tray. But that's easy to deal with considering all the positives. Would buy from this seller again!\n \n  After 10 years, my old toaster oven died.  I looked at various ones on-line and saw this one.  Before purchasing it, I went to Kohl's and looked at a few other brands.  Either the ones they had on display were not in stock or the ones in stock, were not on display.  Completely disgusted, I order the Mueller taster over and it arrived in 2 days.  I've used it on frozen pizza and toasted some bread.  It simple to use and heats up quickly.  I've had it less than a week and look forward to many years of toasting and small baking!!\n \n  This is the worst,cheapest, garbage out there. I've had it for 15 minutes and I'm so disappointed !!!  Gonna drive an hour to Walmart to get a \"ReaL\" toaster oven. This says a lot as I try not to buy from Walmart...Can some American companies please start building stuff again, I pay the extra $20.\n \n  So great! We tossed on the microwave in our house because we don't want to be exposed to any EMF radiation from it anymore (yuck)! So we bought this instead and it does the job even better than our microwave did. Love it, would buy again and definitely recommend to a friend\n \n  Terrific little toaster over.  Easy to read instructions and good looking. Takes up little space but you can cut and cook a two pound chicken for example. Heat distribution is excellent and visibility is great.\n \n  This product is well designed and has knob controls for making your selections, easy to use, no electronics or push buttons.  It comes with 2 trays (wired and solid).  It's a great product made in Austria.\n \n  I am from Europe and I usually look for European made products. \n  This oven is smaller than what i expected.  I find that I need to keep on eye on my food when heating since it does tend to  get very hot and burns food quickly.\n \n  Temperature knob is hard to turn (on/off) compared to my previous Black and Decker.  Also toast settings are too hard to predict accurately as the knob is a problem.  The heat distribution on the toast is not even as it browns in some spots more than others.  Cleaning is not as easy as the tray does not slide out.  You have to lift the toaster and unhook the bottom tray which is a pain.  Going back to my Black and Decker so I hope this burns out quickly!\n \n  I did not see any instructions on the proper use of the toaster. I didn't know that you have to put the temperature on to at least 200 degrees to get the Toaster working. Our old Oster Toaster - did not need that. It automatically turned on the Toaster at the desired time. Also, the bread at the end toasted darker that the two on the front.\n ", "\n  Perfect size to sit on my ancient stove in my rental. This little oven works so well and I don\u2019t have to heat up my tiny rental kitchen for just one person. It\u2019s great! Shipping was quick and well packed. Thank you!\n \n  This toaster is compact and takes only minutes to preheat. Simple and perfect for toasting bread, reheating fried chicken, and pizza. The size is also perfect for 1-2 person household.\n \n  Toaster oven is on the smallish side, not sure output is even on upper and lower heating elements as toast gets burned on underside majority of the time. Will have to use more to get used to it.\n \n  This oven is very compact but found it was much too small for us. My husband tried to bake a couple of biscuits but they cooked too fast and burnt.  He said he had read and followed the directions and he was completely angry about his burnt biscuits!\n \n  I read the reviews prior to ordering however ordered one anyway.  Called distributor and was told by person on phone they will correct the issue of ... 'the tray is not wide enough too fit into the side slots.'  This would add greatly for selling purposes.\n \n  I\u2019ve only had it a day but I love that I can cook smaller food items without having to heat up my large electric stove. This little oven cooks great (broiled some hotdogs)! I\u2019m hoping to see a great savings in my electric bill. I\u2019ll keep you posted!\n \n  Compact, simple and heats up quickly.  Does not toast without a selecting a temperature, toast feature and time. \n  To use the Toast function you have to use all 3 dials.  It requires you to pick an oven temperature for toast.  I've never had to do that on previous toaster ovens I've owned.  The writing for each function is very small so I had a hard time figuring out what setting I needed to be on.  Also, it would be nice if a tray or pan came with it other than just the grill rack.\n \n  Watch food carefully...can burn fast.....Go a little lower in temp.\n \n  The packaging was a bit tattered. There is a small dent on the top front of the toaster oven. This does not affect the working mechanism.  It's taken me a few trial and errors but I am finding this works quite well. I've baked several items, including fish and it has worked out perfectly. It is the perfect size for the area of my counter between the range and the pantry. It is easy to clean.\n ", "\n  It is very difficult to regulate temperature when baking.  I would say it is virtually impossible.  My previous convection oven was wonderful.  This one is mostly a toaster.  Extremely disappointed.  I will be replacing it. Unfortunately I am sure I am am unable to return this.\n \n  This is a very standard almost like an old school over.  It loud when the timer goes off (loud ding, it says multi function but I do not see using this thing for anything other than toasting.\n \n  I love my new Mueller Toaster Oven \n  I recently had my kitchen remodeled, and wanted a nice looking toaster oven for my countertop. His toaster oven looks nice and worked well when I made frozen bagels for breakfast recently.\n \n  All good except for the \u201ctick tick tick tick \u201c while it\u2019s counting down. It\u2019s SO irritating!!! If you have 10 minutes set, it\u2019s ticking away for 10 minutes. The DeLonghi we had before this one didn\u2019t have the ticking.\n \n  Love this toaster oven! We don't have a lot of counter space, so this is perfect - it doesn't take up a lot of room, but it does exactly what we need it to do. Make sure you open the windows when you first fire the oven up and burn off the chemicals. I was very nauseous from the scent of whatever was burning off of it.\n \n  I received this Toaster Oven in quick time and the packaging appeared intact, however the oven never turned on nor did the hearing mechanism work. I have attached a video to display this. \n  Font is very thin and black making it very difficult to read with the glare from the stainless steal ,  cooks very well but the temperature seems to be on the hot side of the control (it will burn things)  you will need to watch your cooking for a  while until you\u2019re used to the adjusted cook times/ temps.\n \n  This is the perfect toaster oven for the price.  It looks and feels well made pulling it out of the box.  The settings and controls are intuitive and easy to understand and the functionality is great.  I have tried many of the traditional \"toaster\" heated foods like toast and frozen waffles and it does a good job.  I checked the oven temperatures with thermometer against the setting temperatures and they were spot on.  I will  be on the look out for other appliances and/or products from this manufacturer and supplier.\n \n  it has been a month and  very satisfying...my previous toaster was burning the bread every time i  keep it a few seconds longer....this one is perfect ..even if i forget the bread slices in the oven, breads are toasted evenly...\n ", "\n  This toaster oven looks amazing in my kitchen, it\u2019s super modern looking! It\u2019s a great size where it does not take up too much space! I love that it has a 2 pan option rather than one! My toast was evenly browned! I also love the keep warm feature!\n \n  Do not buy this item. Mine is 6 months old and the door flops open. \n  Excellent toaster oven! The heat distribution among the food I've put in it so far has been even. So far I've used it for baking, broiling and toasting and it does an effective job. The toaster oven is a good size and it's also easy to clean.\n \n  Toasts evenly..it's great for small items like pizza and mozzarella sticks without using entire oven/wasting energy (and heating house in 96* weather is not an option)..fits on counter perfectly at 10\" deep and even cooks up hamburgers as well and healthier than the stove top.\n \n  No crazy bells and whistles. Just a nice basic toaster oven at a reasonable price. I like being able to cook without heating up the whole house. It's a great addition to my kitchen.\n \n  This unit is a replacement for a 10 year old toaster that finally died.  So far, it works great!  I have only used it for toast and it does a good job,  heat seems to be pretty evenly distributed.  The controls are clearly marked and easy \n  This isn't what I thought , I red others comments on here, I had different brand that was bit bigger and \n  A great choice.  This toaster oven is perfect for our needs.  Doesn't take up too much space on the counter.  It's easy to use.  Seems to heat evenly.  We don't need to heat up the entire kitchen to warm something up.  Highly recommended.\n \n  I have tried not too many toaster ovens before this one, so I can't actually compare it to others toaster ovens, but so far I can tell I am very satisfied with this one. I was a little bit confused about how to use all functions but when I realized it I can say that it is very easy to use every function. It looks magnificent in my kitchen, actually, it looks very expensive. Settings are manual which I really like, the timer goes up to 30 minutes and you can also choose to use it without time control. Size meets my needs.\n \n  Buttons are labeled, but very indistinctly etched on the metal. Toasting temps are not sufficient to brown a slice of bread. The top is darker than the bottom of the slice. ", "\n  I love that this toasts items, I always want my pizza or subs extra well done and this allows me to do so without cooking everything extra long. The tray is easy to clean even with melted cheese and bbq sauce on it. I threw my regular toaster in a cupboard and use this bad boy instead. Kids love that they can cook pizza rolls and bagels in it quickly too. No complaints and I dont see this moving off of my counter anytime soon.\n \n  We love our little toaster oven. We use it everyday for toast, heating up small about of food etc. My kids make grill cheese sandwiches and for the price you can't beat it. We don't need anything fancy but something functional which this toaster is. There isn't a crumb tray so I need to carefully hold it up to clean crumbs but I don't mind.  Unfortunately, the door had a little problem and I call customer services they couldn't have been more helpful. I highly recommend this toaster.\n \n  I was looking for a simple toaster oven (like one that a family friend had when I was a child). Looked at pricier ones, but decided to give this one a try and do not regret that decision! Very pleased with this little toaster oven! Not too big and does everything we need it to do with ease!\n \n  I am very pleased with this purchase. It has been very convenient to toast and warm small portions quickly without having to wait for the big oven to heat up. I really appreciate that it has a timer and temperature control so my food never burns. The kids have a blast making their own personal pizzas and watching through the glass. It makes them feel very accomplished and gives me the peace of mind that they don't run the risk of getting burned in the big oven.\n \n  Nice and compact perfect for supporting my Ketogenic diet....\n \n  The product came in perfect condition and was packaged very well. I like the appearance of the toaster oven and it is easy to use. I look forward to enjoying it in the years to come. Great value for the money!\n \n  Well made and performance meets the needs of my family. I use it mostly for reheating things that don't do well in microwave or when I don't want to bother using my full size oven.\n \n  I went to target and walmart  Because of COVID supply of toaster ovens are down, all the good ones are not available  I am Austrian by descent and have a Mueller French Press so I knew the quality and materials used would be top of the line  I was not diappointed  Tremendous heat capacity and design allows for even toasting  Setting the temp of the toaster to a range of intensities adjusts the quality of the toasting  Great product, better than any of the common chinese made ovens\n \n  In order to remove the crumb tray: \n  I just received my toaster oven yesterday. It looks sleek and has very easy to understand dials/knobs. So far I have only toasted a few pieces of toast, but it works great and toasts evenly. There is plenty of room inside the toaster oven that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to burn my hand as I remove my item. I feel that this will become a a much used item in my kitchen.\n ", "\n  The toast function, which is why I bought it doesn\u2019t work.  It starts and then just stops without completing.  If I set it past toast it will run fully, but very crispy.\n \n  I got this toaster oven for my office since it was compact enough to fit on top of my office mini fridge since I don't prefer heating my lunch in the microwave, so far it works as expected, now I pack my prepared sandwiches and just heat them inside coming all perfect and toasty :)\n \n  I don't like to heat up my oven when I can use a toaster oven.  I have never had one to last very long because I make things like meatloaf in mine.  It is on for an hour. I am still trying to fine one that lasts. I have used Black and Decker and others.\n \n  I have been wanting a toaster oven for quite some time so I finally broke down and bought one and I'm so happy I did! It is amazing! We have used it almost daily. It's perfect for reheating food. We put a little foil in the pan which makes for super easy clean up. Wish I would have bought it sooner!\n \n  Just got this, but was disappointed to find that although the product description and owner's manual said it had a removable crumb tray - it does not.  You have to lift up the toaster oven and open a hinged door to access the crumb tray.  Even though the manual says to soak bad spills, this is impossible.  You need to be able to wipe it off.  Too early to rate the other features.\n \n  I love this Toaster Oven it is sturdy and compact and fits nicely in my small kitchen. I am most pleased with how tightly the door shuts so the oven stays up to temp.\n \n  I got this product to free up the oven for bigger things and to also use in the warmer months without heating up the entire house. This toaster oven helped me achieve all that and also looks quite nice on my counter!\n \n  Really nice, better than I expected! I assumed it was all silver, but it's actually black and silver and it matches all my other appliances, which is awesome. \n  This toaster oven is far better than previous brands I have tried and returned.  While it tends to darken the toast on the under side slightly more than the top ( a common problem with all I have tried) this model is closer to even heating than any others..  It gets the toast done faster than any others too.\n \n  This is a GREAT little toaster oven. Warms up almost instantly and very economical for quick lunches & snacks etc. It's better suited for 2 slices of bread unless they are small slices. Shipping was fast and customer service is even faster! Great price great quality!\n ", "\n  I love this toaster oven.  This is a must have for a small kitchen and I love to use this when I don't want to heat up my house but want to cook something in the oven.\n \n  Just bought the product. Very nice packaging. Overall good quality for the price. A few things that noticed right from the get go. The knobs are plastic and one of them lost the silver coating in a few places on day one. Also the toaster overheats and you can feel a lot of heat being conducted from the top of the toaster. (Had a breville prior and was very cool on the top)\n \n  Does not toast, in my opinion. A toaster oven it is not.\n \n  Good toaster oven great for reheating food I was just disappointed when the hinge came off and the door wouldn\u2019t close anymore after 10 months. contacted customer service they immediately shipped me a new unit without me having to return the old one excellent customer service I will buy from them again!\n \n  Very nice toaster oven and works great.  Nice to find a reliable product that is not a name brand.  Sleek design,easy to read controls, and nice even heating and toasting functions.\n \n  Happy with the quality so far.  Not the best for making toast, but that's to be expected from a toaster oven.  Use the oven to cook chicken breasts and it came out great.  Seems to be built well for being under $50.\n \n  very small, and dials are a bit old fashioned she be simplified hard to take out the try as well but it technically does what a toaster oven is suppose to do.\n \n  This oven doesn't generate enough heat. I often roast vegetables in a toaster oven, and with my previous toaster oven the small cut veggies would take about ten minutes to cook, with this oven it takes a good 30 minutes. There are two baking elements --top and bottom--and only the bottom element heats up in baking mode, which may explain the low heat level \n  I like that is doesn't take up much space on the counter and it is sleek and well built. What I don't like is that the controls have very small print and some are grayed out which makes them very hard to read. I had to bend over and get up close to see them at all when i first got it. Knobs are still and hard to turn and it takes longer than i would expect (from a previous toaster/oven) to toast a piece of bread or muffin. Only used for toasting, no baking yet.\n \n  Good product!  One minor issue: very difficult to read dial print.  Had to get flashlight to read what was printed around dials.\n ", "\n  Easy to clean and operate, but the heat distribution is all over the place. Used every setting possible, but you either burn the top, bottom, or both sides.\n \n  I just bought this toaster oven and I am very, very disappointed with it. I have used it twice..first time was garlic bread and it turned out ok...second time made a meatloaf and the oven started smoking and the top burner started on fire! \n  I have had this for a few months and I love it. It crisps and toast so evenly with no burnt edges. Great for mini pizzas and anything that gets soggy in microwave.It does not take up much counter space which is a plus. Don't hesitate in buying.\n \n  As both an experiment and an effort to make more cookies for a bake sale at school, I figured I'd use this toaster oven to bake some cookies while the large oven was being taken up by another batch. It didn't disappoint in the process and got out some very good looking and crisp cookies. So, whenever I need to use the oven to a small extent, I'm going to instead opt for this toaster oven. That way, I save on gas and have an easier time handling everything.\n \n  We have only had this product for a couple days and we already love it! It does not take up a lot of space but gets the job done. The temperature control and heat distribution are perfect. Would definitely recommend!\n \n  This a a great little oven. Fairly compact, self-explanatory. Clean design. I have only made toast so far but it\u2019s so nice, I\u2019m going to give it to my daughter!\n \n  Bought for our office kitchen. It does the job we need but can\u2019t turn timer off if you finish warming sooner. \n  Cooks well. Do far we have toasted bagels and toast..great. It cooks well also. The only con for me is that the whole unit heats up. I wish there was a cool/neutral spot on the outside that doesn't get hot. Otherwise great!\n \n  Makes my daily breakfast routine way less of a chore! I'm not dreading getting up and having to toil in the kitchen for a couple of slices of toast, a bit of bacon, and coffee which does admittedly come out nicely. Instead, I can use this super versatile tool to get myself up on the right foot. The oven does all of the work for me. I just sit back and relax after having put most of what I needed breakfast in this toaster oven and get on with the rest of my morning routine.\n \n  It works! Word of caution: the outside of the door along the base gets insanely hot. I gave myself a decent 2nd degree burn because I brushed my hand up against it.\n ", "\n  Needed a toaster because I hate turning on the oven for bread and small things. I was supposed to get a free julienne peeler with it but it never arrived.\n \n  I love Mueller products!  They are great craftsmanship.  I have not had a problem with anything I've purchased.  This little oven has not disappointed!  Thanks so much for the great product!\n \n  Very satisfied with this good quality toaster oven. One person household, perfect size for small kitchen countertop. The temperature heats up quickly. Purchased for small cooking jobs like tuna melts and crisping foods. The only complaint I have is that the numbers on the dials are hard to read, used the instruction manual as a guide until I became familiar with the settings.\n \n  This oven is quite small.  The thing that bothers me the most is that it is almost impossible to read the controls.  The letters are sooooo small.  I wouldn't buy this again.\n \n  Disappointed in this product.  It can't even cook one pork chop.  If I could, I would have returned it, but it's been used.  Would not recommend it.\n \n  For the price, it's a good looking and durable toaster oven that will stay with you for years. The insides and outside are easy to clean and keep clean, and the toaster itself heats up fairly quickly when set to any temperature between 100 - 450 degrees. The convection feature makes it that every piece of food you have no matter on what tray position it's in is cooked well through and is depending on what mode you use it one, either crispy or not.\n \n  I love it. Does not take up too much space on the countertop. Cooks evenly the timer control is very handy Kitchen stays cooler. GREAT product. would buy it again. Great seller. A+++\n \n  I have had this oven for 2 months, and I use it every day. I no longer need my microwave for anything but popping popcorn. I prefer heating up leftovers in the mini oven, my sandwiches come out toasted and with melted cheese inside. It's a real game changer. My mornings have been so much better ever since I started heating up my sandwiches in it while I get ready for work. Having a warm meal every morning is the best thing to prep me for the day.\n \n  When I moved to my new apartment, I realized I needed a new toaster oven. This one is so nice and matches the rest of my kitchen appliances. It doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter, but it does the job of a huge oven. I love the fact that I don't need to waste energy to heat up the big oven or accidentally burning my food. Once the food is done, the timer goes off and it keeps the food warm until I am ready to get it out. Perfect for my on the go lifestyle.\n \n  We needed a new toaster at work so I figured I would buy this and give it a try! I love how it\u2019s spacious inside but doesn\u2019t take up a ton of counter space (smaller footprint than our OLD one, but more room inside) and it works great! Everyone at my store is super happy with my purchase and I\u2019m happy to have this quality toaster around for many years to come!\n ", "\n  I used it to make oatmeal cookies and it was super fast and easy process!! Will sure come in handy for future use. I will say it does steam the higher the heat and heat distribution could be better (hotter at the back) but other than that. It was great.\n \n  How can this be listed as convection?  There is no fan and it is not marked as a convection oven.  There is nothing in the instructions referring to convection.\n \n  Lo amo!!!! I set it up and use it the same day I received it. My wife and I are totally satisfied with this oven. I know visitors are going to ask about it.\n \n  I just got this toaster oven and am really happy with how well made it is. The controls seem easy to use. It heats up very quickly. It\u2019s a good size also.\n \n  Why this toaster oven does have a good amount of functionality for the price point, it's not fancy and won't be doing a bunch of crazy things besides baking, broiling, toasting, and keeping food warm, which are more than adequate. It takes longer than an actual oven to cook things in here since there isn't as much insulation as a larger oven but it's only a ten-minute difference which is negligible if you plan right.\n \n  For a smaller toaster oven, color me impressed. The trays are sturdy while not too stain or residue resistant as I'd like but that can be taken care of with a bit of aluminum foil each time I use it. The heating elements also do a good just at heating the toaster oven evenly throughout and willie I don't understand the concept of convection, I think it's cool.  my food is much more evenly cooked than with my old toaster.\n None None None \n  \u00a0Burn away the assumed electronics insulation that wants to burn first 3 minutes off use, then it will be good from there.\n \n  The rack or grate does not fit snugly into the grooves and will collapse when used in the bottom position.  The knobs are slick and round, and if your fingers are wet or oily, it's hard to get enough traction to turn them.  The toasting degree indicator is unreliable; you have to keep an eye on the toast and keep adjusting.  I go through a lot of toaster ovens.  I think I'll go back to Black & Decker.\n \n  controls work great-compact size with 1100 watts cooks fast- not easy to clean-can't remove crumb tray- door hinge is fragile ( not for heavy use)- unfortunately the door hinges broke within 6 months and I had to toss in the garbage\n \n  The oven heats up quickly and evenly. It is stylish and fits nicely on the counter; not too big. Knobs are responsive and the tray is a good size.\n ", "\n  So far this product is great. Bought it as a replacement for my grandma whose home is the center of our family with 12 children 36 grandchildren 10 + great grand children and one great great grandchild.  We very one in the family of a constantly using the toaster oven when they visit so it really needs to be sturdy so far works great.\n \n  I like the small size; it does not take up much room on the counter.  That's the good.  What i don't like is that while there is a toast setting, there is no guidance on the temperature required to toast.  Pretty simple thing that should be included in the instructions.  Other than that , it's pretty good.  I'm still trying to get the right setting.\n \n  I bought this as a gift for a new homeowner, and she tells me she is really pleased with it, thinks it's an excellent choice.  Sorry no more details at this point.\n \n  I love the ease of operation, it\u2019s simplicity and it\u2019s attractiveness. I use it for all kinds of things - toast, veggie sausage, small pizzas.\n \n  I can't figure out all the great reviews.  We have had this for 2 weeks and it consistently burns the toast on the bottom.  I have adjusted the temperature setting and the toast setting.  We also tried heating up and broiling chicken nuggets.  After that when we used it there was a lot of smoke.  This never happened with our previous toaster.  We are disappointed and unfortunately will be returning.\n \n  This was bought as a christmas gift.  I bought it because the tebiews i went thru indicated it was a better brand than the one I considered.\n \n  Very slick, easy to use , I've been putting it to work everyday since I got it as the cafeteria at my work is still closed. Breakfast and lunch each day - saving money and eating healthier!\n \n  Product information as described.  Shipping packing was exceptional. \n  I love this little oven! I wished it was bigger though. I thought it would be big enough to put a 12\u201d pizza in but unfortunately no. \n  Do not like having to tilt up the oven to clean out the crumb tray.  This way the crumbs fall out onto the counter.  It would be better to have a slide-out crumb tray.\n ", "\n  I like the toaster, and the features it offers. The bake, broil and toast...with 2 different levels to place the bake rack for prefered height especially when broiling since the heat is on top.\n \n  In my delivery, I got a nice little toaster oven that I'm actively coming up with more and more creative meals to make with. This is a good toaster oven for those of you who are alone as of now and don't feel like doubling your monthly gas bill by using the oven for just one person. The food comes out well cooked but since it takes a little longer than normal ovens to heat up, I would adjust prep and expected cook time appropriately.\n \n  Love this product came in big handy did not have a regular oven kitchen was getting remodeled so I cook all meals out of the toaster oven\n \n  Solid construction, heats quickly. Slightly slower than a toaster but once you learn the settings makes toast the same every time. Plus its useful for heating up or even cooking smaller items.\n \n  After looking for a new toaster oven I decided to go with this one it seemed to have good reviews. So far I\u2019m loving it. It\u2019s not so big but has plenty space inside. Fits nice on my small counter. And very easy to clean. I would recomend\n \n  It has a good size to put a pizza in it but the drip pan in it not as my expectation but yeah if they do have a drip pan that is really removable it will be better the cord too it's not too long but overall great buy for the price of it ^_^\n \n  I like that this is such a compact size, but still able to fit enough items in for serving sizes. It has allowed me to have more Much needed counter space!\n \n  The unit never heated, has complicated settings and made using a toaster oven a headache for the first time in my life.  I have owned many different brands over more than 50 years of marriage and this one was so unfriendly, I returned it the next day.  I shouldn\u2019t have to spend days trying to figure out how to make it work.\n \n  The toaster oven seems fine, but I \n  I had to return this toaster because it did not fit my 9\" pizza pan, but the description said it would.  It did look like a good product though for those with different needs.\n ", "\n  I haven't found anything yet that I dislike about the product. Price was reasonable, performs well.  I really have enjoyed my problem free addition to our kitchen!!\n \n  This was a great addition to my kitchen counter. The design is modern and with the brushed chrome, it matches the rest of my appliances. I am happy that it feels well made and not cheap like previous ovens I have had. I am excited to begin enjoying a warm breakfast even when I am in a rush in the morning to get to work. I like the convenience of the timer that turns off and keeps my food warm until I am ready to get it out.\n \n  I like this toaster oven it works great and I recommended to anyone my only complaint is the size I was used to the one I had before which was a little bit bigger if you have a family of 3 or more people I will recommend the one where you can accommodate 6 slices of bread but everything else is good. I\u2019m very satisfied with the product.\n \n  So far I am loving how easy and convenient this toaster oven is. I was able to cook a personal pan pizza in it and tasted great, thoroughly cooked. It's only my husband and me at home, so using the big oven seems like such a waste. I made a loaf of banana bread in it too. I think it's even better than using the regular oven since I can set the timer and temp, it turns off when done and lets me know with a loud enough peep.\n \n  I ordered this to replace an old toaster oven. I love the compact size of it. It is also very lightweight but well made. The appearance is professional looking. It is easy to clean and operate. Price is well worth it.\n \n  I like everything about this toaster oven, except the crumb tray....for some reason they made it so it non removable, so you have to lift the oven, open crumb tray and brush crumbs out, a bit of a pain...other than that everything's great !!\n \n  I love how it is compact enough for my small counters but yet is still able to cook many number of meals for my family of 3. And I can cook several bagels and waffles at a time. It\u2019s very versatile\n \n  Works well, wish it had a bagel setting for one side but put on broil same thing last oven had the setting. Happy with it performs well.\n \n  I'm confused why this product is so highly-reviewed and remains an \"Amazon's Choice\" \n  Love this oven. Very fast to heat up, even heat. Toasted bread great without drying out the bread.\n ", "\n  I ordered this toaster oven for my new apartment. I needed something small, minimal and stylish yet affordable and this seem to fit my objectives. I'm surprised to learn of this European brand. I just used the toaster today and I really liked how it worked. The no-fuss manual dials are great vs. something digital.\n \n  Very pleased with this toaster oven.  The size is great,  Heats up fast and the outside of the oven is not hot, which is very important when children are around.  Great value for the money!  I recommend it.\n \n  Not the worlds best toaster. Toasting takes a long time and isn\u2019t terribly even. The oven function works great but if you\u2019re looking for a toaster this is not it.\n \n  The control knobs of this toaster oven are easy enough to set to what you want and the timer's ticking isn't loud enough to bother you. It shuts off when it's set to. The material is stainless except for the sides which do make it a little less stylish but it's not a deal-breaker and they did have to make some concessions in an effort to add other more useful features like convection and four different cooking modes.\n \n  Always wanted to purchase a toaster oven but had no great knowledge of them. so I thought I would try this one.and I fell in love. I use it all the time.\n \n  I  I did not like the knobs on the toaster plus the toaster was  too small and I did not like anything about the toaster oven . I called the number that was in the book  that came with  The toaster oven and the name is Home universe and they told me that Amazon would refund my money and I did not have to send it back very much like to hear from you about the situation I have the number from Home universe if you would like it my email is  BROGAN 55@comcast.net thank you very much  Mary and Kane\n \n  Didn't want to spend to much for toaster oven to toast bagels & bread. This was perfect price for me. A little bigger than I would like, but works well.\n \n  I have had a Cuisinart Toaster Oven for 10 years.  When it finally died I was uncertain whether to buy one again or try a new brand.  After reading all the reviews I decided to buy the Mueller brand.  When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  Half the price with all of the same features.  It is an excellent choice.\n \n  This is by far the best toaster oven I have ever owned! It toasts anything I want extremely well and evenly. The temperature setting is perfect and it looks so sleek and clean in my kitchen. I like that it is spacious and can hold more than two things at once. I love that it is stainless steel, too. It makes for a better quality oven. I am very happy with this purchase and I know that it will last me years to come.\n \n  The instructions do not give a temperature setting for toast.  How am I supposed to know how hot/cold to set it for toast????\n ", "\n  This toaster oven is small, but mighty, cooks faster then your oven so you need to keep an eye out. I roasted a cut up chicken and it came out really good. Toasts bread, bagals and English muffins evenly. Easy to clean, with a pull out tray. This is a sturdy unit that does not take up a large amount of space on your counter. Great for heating up leftovers and avoiding using the oven. I love this little powerhouse?\n \n  Beautiful stainless steel toaster oven- fits perfectly in our small office kitchenette.  Now finally, we can bring raw foods/ good from home and get a more \u201clike home\u201d baking and broiling experience, without the constant \u201cmicrowaveable experience\u201d. Love it!!\n \n  This is very clean looking in detail and sits on the counter top nicely without taking up a bunch of room. I have already cooked a few different things in it and am happy with its performance\n \n  The bad thing about buying things sight unseen on the internet is that the details of operating a small appliance like this are unknown until you open the box. The timer on this machine is terrible. There is no preset for toasting, just a knob that you turn to a very \u201capproximate\u201d setting- so every time out, it\u2019s a crapshoot.  I\u2019ll be returning this and buying something like I had before, which has a preset time & temp for toasting.\n \n  Love this toaster oven. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space and it\u2019s super easy to use. Also Mueller gives a percentage of your purchase to help those in crisis situations get back on their feet and they help troubled youth via the Youth Opportunity Center. Love companies that give back.\n \n  Toasted perfect set at 450. It\u2019s the perfect size, for what I wanted. Didn\u2019t get crazy hot on the outside like other brands. So far so good.\n \n  When we 1st received, this toaster oven operated fairly well. Now, less than 5 months later, the top element is shot and the bottom element burns everything!  Do not buy!\n \n  I have not been disappointed by the Mueller brand yet and this toaster is nothing to differ. This works as well as my previous mini oven that was twice as expensive as this. The old toaster oven's element broke and forced me to get this one which I'm in hindsight happy about. The analog clock limits setting the time always being good but it's still effective and a couple of seconds here and there is no problem.\n \n  The Mueller toaster oven is fairly large on the inside while also having a sleek and compact signature that won't get in the way of the rest of your kitchen by taking up too much space. It's sleek and well designed and on a happy coincidental note is the same color as my dishwasher, fridge, and toaster so it looks at home in my kitchen even more. I'm really happy with this toaster's ease of use and versatility.\n \n  The title of that review makes it sound like it's scorchingly negative but I mean that in a positive way. What you're getting isn't a flimsy and cheap feeling toaster oven but a toaster oven that will last through a couple of drops that are inevitable and still work great! It's a sturdy design that has a bunch of features, nothing crazy difficult to figure, that don't come with other ovens at this price point.\n ", "\n  my oven quit working....during the pandemic. so i ordered this on  Amazon. works great and i don't have to heat my oven.\n \n  The toaster oven does even more than I was expecting. It also bakes, broils & roasts. The size is perfect. It is on the smaller side which is what I was looking for. The design is stylish & modern. It is easy to use all of the functions.\n \n  Love everything about this toaster oven!  Perfect countertop size. Sturdy construction. \n  My toast gets toasted on the underneath side but not the top. This oven smokes when I make toast. Very scary\n \n  Happy with the toaster. I had not had such a good toaster for a long time.\n \n  I love the looks because It looks fancy! Oven is a perfect size for a small kitchen. It heats the food fast and the heat is well distributed.\n \n  I dont like it. Does not cook food evenly.\n \n  Items arrived in timely manner.  Small but powerful machine and also fits perfectly on kitchen counter.  One improvement is a power off button or dial added.\n \n  I love the compact size, fits on my counter and i also love the different ways to heat,  toast and bake. Very well put together also. I would definitely recommend this item.\n \n  It's a nice and nifty tool to have if you're like me and just want to heat yourself up to something when working from home and don't need the extra hassle but can appreciate a nice looking appliance that your wife isn't totally against you having a hand in buying. It looks good in the kitchen, matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen and works well enough to become a staple in my family's food routine.\n ", "\n  This is a great little toaster oven. The controls are simple, the size is perfect, it\u2019s short enough to be under cabinets, it\u2019s deep enough to hold 4 slices. All good.\n \n  Very small for the price. Half the size I was expecting.  Ok for toast I guess, but not much space for anything else.\n \n  It was difficult to set any kind of temperature and time to cook toast which was the most basic of options. Because that would be the most frequent use,  I could not move past that issue.  I did not try any other settings and returned it. \n  What a great little gadget this is. It does everything a regular oven does and more. I am thrilled that I can get the perfect grilled cheese sandwich in only minutes. My kids are into melted cheese in their sandwiches as of late. I am happy I can throw some in the over while I get them ready for school. It gives me the peace of mind that they have a good breakfast on their way to school every morning.\n \n  After only having it for about 2 years, my last mini toaster died and I needed a more reliable replacement. So far this has been an amazing replacement. Works great and heats up food in a jiffy. I can heat up just about anything, which is convenient since I hate using the microwave. I actually use it to heat up my personal frozen pizza better than the regular oven. It is so much easier and I love it!!\n \n  I wanted something that I could place a Pizza in, something big enough so that i would not have to use my over.  My fault, bad buy\n \n  Finally, a toaster oven that doesn\u2019t take up a huge chunk of real estate on the kitchen counter! Great, good looking, toaster oven that has easy to use controls. Just what I was looking for!\n \n  Very nice design!!  It cooks evenly and is very easy to operate.  Comes nicely packaged, all you have to do is plug it in!!\n \n  Looks big in pic, the woman in this house says size really does matter, she could not see getting any satisfaction from the small maching\n \n  This is really lightweight and just okay. Was expecting more from a European toaster oven. It\u2019s OK but I wouldn\u2019t order it again not give it as a gift.\n ", "\n  I've used a lot of toasters from college to now, and each one broke before. My last toaster's door suddenly stopped closing all the way. This time, I bought a Mueller toaster and it functions incredibly well. There are 3 knobs to control bake, broil, and toast, and having these 3 settings all separated is very convenient. The design is sleek and clean. I like it a lot and will be ordering a second one for my office.\n \n  We are a small family and using the big oven is a kind of energy waste when we bake a small amount of food. I did some research and found out this one. It looks very space saving and the design looks very simple and elegant. After I received and used it for a couple of times, I really like it! It is very easy to use, and the heating up is very fast. It meets most of our baking needs! Energy saving and space saving\u2019\n \n  It is almost impossible to read the logos on the dial or the temperatures, etc.  It works like a toaster oven should, once you can figure out the symbols.  VERY BAD design defect!\n \n  Our old one died I love that the controls are manual less that can go wrong. Use it all the time probably our most used appliance. Easy to clean.\n \n  It fits my small counter space perfectly- see width measurement in photo. When baking French fries or anything we want crispy, we use the \u201ctoasting\u201d setting so the heat elements for top and bottom are both on. \n  My best lil gadget in my kitchen. The cooking area is actually not that big, but its perfect for me. It heats up in like 3 minutes up to 400\u00b0 but my kitchen never heats up. It has a timer, so you dont need to watch it ever second. I'm very happy with this teeny oven. Toast, burgers, steak, chicken, sausages, what ever you need...as long as it can fit inside.\n \n  Smaller than what you imagine.  1 light bulb burner in the bottom and 1 on top.  The door very flimsy and doesnt have anything to stop when you close it so it closes hard and noisy.  Needed some sort of rubber stop.  Also be careful, it gets hot but I think that's with all smaller ovens as ive experience in the past.\n \n  I\u2019ve owned two other airfryers this by far is the best. The fact that I can turn it up so it doesn\u2019t take up all the counter space is a huge plus! Love the larger tray. I\u2019ve cooked 9 chicken breast at one time! Love all the different options! Way to go. I would recommend to others.\n \n  I used it for the first time today and I think it is an excellent toaster oven. Very well manufactured and heats super fast. It has the advantage of being a convection oven that greatly reduces energy consumption.\n \n  This toaster oven has been a great help in my kitchen. I love having reheated pizza in it, nothing like a soggy pizza from the microwave. It's super easy to make any type of sandwich and have the surprise of melted cheese inside. I like that I can set the temperature and time so that my food never burns. The only downside is that It only fits 3 sandwiches if you squish them. I wish it fit 4.\n ", "\n  Very pleased and satisfied with the product Muller Toaster Oven including performance (fast) , size and stainless steel sleek look. \n  This is a great toaster oven!  Beautifully designed, the top doesn't get super hot while cooking and easy to use!\n \n  The door on this toaster oven has broken several times since we purchased it. First, the spring that holds the door closed slipped off the pin it's hooked to several times. Now the bracket that attaches that spring to the door slips off the door nearly every time the door is opened. I've taken the cover off to fix it at least 8 times. It's now going in the trash. Other than that, it worked fine.\n \n  Fits our need for a basic toaster. Relatively compact and simple controls. The timer is an old school analog counter with a bell at the end.\n \n  We have been very dissatisfied with this toaster oven.  the knobs are very difficult to read (ie, toast vs. bake) and it heats very unevenly.  you have to watch anything you put in it constantly to prevent burning.  we will replace it soon.\n \n  Disappointed at best...I found the knobs were not as descriptive of the settings as they should have been. When looking to toast, I could not tell what setting I was on because it is a large square with no indicator or arrow. So I either got very light toast or burnt. There is always a plume of smoke when I toast.  I am very leery of baking and/or broiling. I wouldn't know what to expect.\n \n  We thought this would be better than the old 2 or 4 slice toaster but it\u2019s not. It takes a long time to cook anything.  Might as well throw it in the oven. Doesn\u2019t heat evenly either. Thanks\n \n  i like the overall look and design of this Austrian unit.. It is not cheap looking like things mfg'd. in the states. It costs a bit more than a toaster oven would here (in US) but if you don't want to replace your appliances every year you'll love this \n  Bought two of these toasters as gifts so I can't comment on features. I bought this particular toaster oven because of it size.\n \n  There are a lot of people out there with the creativity to do very interesting things with their toaster ovens and make truly unique meals but me, I just use this for the usual breakfast stuff and it works wonderfully in that arena. I get my toast browned evenly throughout and don't need to turn it over and risk burning my hands. The handle's fairly well insulated and it heats up quick.\n ", "\n  I bought this to add to my morning routine (and pizza baking). It takes up a lot of space on the counter, but makes up in functionality. I burned a grilled cheese on the first day, but it was easy to clean. The oven heats up really fast. Useful and convenient, but make sure you have enough counter space.\n \n  Great little toaster oven. I like the extra height inside this one. And the 2 tray levels. Using it on my boat!\n \n  Larger capacity than other toaster ovens. The big glass door allows you to see all your food while it's cooking.  Easy to remove the crumb catcher too. Great product!\n \n  I love that this is entirely stainless steel! It\u2019s a nice upgrade from my half plastic, half stainless steel one. This is roomy and looks nice just leaving on my counter top. These are  a must for the kitchen. I love this company too! They give a free gift with every product.\n \n  I just got it so haven\u2019t really been able to see the cooking results with temperature control and ease of cleaning  but really enjoy the Function settings.... particularly that the toast option heats Top and bottom. I like that the exterior is compact so saves counter top space and appears that the inside is not compromised. I didn\u2019t see a drop pan so  suggestion for the future models.\n \n  It took a few tries to get used to this toaster oven. The toaster oven gets really hot and I'm finding that I need a lower temperature or less cooking time than what cooking instructions recommend to avoid burning my food. It is still super convenient and beats having to pre-heat a full sized oven. The broil function does a good job melting cheeses or adding a slight crunch to my food.\n \n  I liked the fact that the unit heated up quickly.  It was very powerful and took a few times to get the temp right.\n \n  Knowing a toaster oven can range from 25 bucks to over 100, I figured I would go with something in the middle. No regrets! It's a great unit with lots of adjustments. Replaces my 20 year-old proctor silex whose cable was getting too hot during operation. \n  Simple, basic, no frills, uncomplicated. Compact design with small footprint allows use in limited space. Still haven't figured out how to remove crumb tray for cleaning.\n \n  Leftovers are easy enough to heat up evenly and thoroughly with the help of this toaster oven. You get a good amount of heat coming off of this toaster oven which isn't too great since heat loss makes it heat up much more slowly but it still gets up there in temperature in a good amount of time. The handle does get hot but not too hot that you'd burn yourself ever even when the thermostat is set at 400.\n ", "\n  This is your basic easy to use a convection toaster oven that has a lot of capacity (Can heat half a pizza at the same time). The timer shuts off when it should and is easy enough to set and the knobs aren't wobbly. The temperature goes up to 450 degrees so there is a lot that can be cooked in this. It has been a lot more convenient than needing to turn on the big oven for small meals\n \n  This is a great toaster oven. Perfectly toasts 4 slices of bread. Easy to read and use control knobs. Compact and does not take up too much space on countertop!!\n \n  Easy to use, ample space inside. Stylish. Much better than my last toaster oven. A positive upgrade!\n \n  Works perfect, was a little concerned with the knobs getting the temperature correct but is not an issue at all. Love the tiers and the ability to have multiple trays. For the price, this couldn\u2019t be better. Thank you!\n \n  As this was a gift, I don't have much feedback other than she liked the size for her small apartment.\n \n  This Toaster Oven is Beautiful and it heats up very quickly which makes my life a lot easier. I am super pleased with it so far and excited to try cooking some of the bigger items I couldn\u2019t cook in my other Toaster Oven because it took forever to heat up and didn\u2019t cook evenly.\n \n  This is a feature-rich and sleek looking oven that is at home in any house with a modern motif. I can toast, bake, and broil to my liking with this oven and I'm really happy that I went through with the purchase. The two rows of racks let you position what you're heating up or cooking so that it's either away or near the source of heat so you actually get to decide which side is the more crispy side\n \n  Had to send back. Arrived with a misaligned door, would not close properly\n \n  I had never heard of Mueller until this purchase . Will definitely try more products by this company\n \n  Good oven, not much to it. It looks great in my kitchen and I save tons since I barely use my big oven. As a single guy, I barely cook but anytime I want to heat something up, I use it. The color is great as well and it is durable. Honestly my favorite thing to make is pizza, and I can get me a nice personal size pizza made in 20 minutes. Came with a few cool recopies that I will eventually get to.\n ", "\n  The toaster oven was a gift for my daughter.  We open the box and turned the toaster on. It smoked but I think its just that new first time turning on. The size was perfect.  She really liked it.\n \n  Sturdy but lightweight. Easy to use, heats up quickly and cools down quickly, too. Very efficient.\n \n  The appliance functions as described in product description, all features work and the appliance fits perfectly on my countertop. The appliance looks nice in my modern kitchen also. Shipping was fast and met the Christmas deadline.\n \n  Going to return. Cannot back or toast without the bottom burning.  I've tried using lower temperature  and does the same.  Yesterday was the last straw.  The bottom burner caught on fire.\n \n  The nicest toaster oven I've seen in a long time. I like the compact size, my kitchen is small and it does not take up a lot of cabnet space. I like the dial better than the digital. The only thing I would change is the symbols are small and hard to read. Have to get real close to see them, other than that it's a very nice product. I would buy again.\n \n  When I used it there was a burned plastic smell that I thought was going to go away but it didn't. It does not cook evenly and every time I try to bake something the bottom get burned and the top is left uncooked. Also when I tried using the broiling function smoke started coming out.\n \n  Alot smaller than I actually thought it would be. Overall it's a good unit, but I am disappointed with the amount of cooking space.\n \n  Smaller footprint than our old toaster oven, leaving more counter space. Toasts quickly for a toaster oven. There are reveiwea that it's hard to use the toast function but its not difficult and is basically the same as our previous toaster oven in terms of how it works. Not unusual or hard to use\n \n  it's smaller than i expected, but will still do what i need it to do, which is toast bread and small baking jobs. i'm still getting used to the buttons. but i like the oven.\n \n  I finally got my oven and followed the \"before first use\" instructions -TO THE LETTER- but within 5 minutes on the toast function the heating element stopped working and wouldnt turn back on. Total waste of money.\n ", "\n  It\u2019s small and light weight but it heats fast and doesn\u2019t radiate the heat I thought it would\n \n  I love how fast my new toaster oven heats up but also has variable settings to keep things from burning which is why I don\u2019t use my main kitchen oven.\n \n  I bought this for my Mother in law and she loves it. It does everything she needs and looks great on her countertop.\n \n  We were looking for a smaller toaster over that would not take-up a lot of counter space and this was the perfect fit! Instructions easy to follow, heated before first use and no smoke, slight odor. Has multi-use options but we've only used the toast option as of now. Would have preferred a slide-out crumb tray but was not a deal-breaker for me. Very happy with this purchase.\n \n  NIce tall toaster oven that I found others did not provide. \n  It evenly cooked foods.\n \n  Good little oven but if they offer a $10 gift card for a review it won\u2019t come to fruition\n \n  This product - regardless of description - DOES NOT HAVE A REMOVABLE CRUMB TRAY.  On top of all that, the middle rack doesn't have a \"stop\" so it comes flying out with your food and is a floor and foot hazard.  Heats unevenly...Buns not toasted on top, burnt on the bottom.  Price may be attractive but this is NOT the toaster oven for you if you need it to be functional.\n \n  Absolutely loved how it toasted my French bread to perfection. \n  Ordered due to space limitations. Very pleased with the size, weight and functionality of this toaster oven, works very well and the most important part is My Wife\u2019s Approves \ud83d\ude00\n ", "\n  Great toaster oven. Impressive fit and finish; adequate functions; clean design: compact and perfect for the counter. Toasting and baking well controlled with good results. Fine product for the price.\n \n  It works fine and it's not too bad to clean. Please note...if you turn the timer knob too far, you can't turn it back very easily, so you have to be very careful when setting the timer.\n \n  I\u2019ve had my toaster oven a few months now and I love it. It\u2019s very user friendly and with the way I work I\u2019m not able to cook much so its definitely helping me in that area. Thanks so much stay blessed and be safe. \n  This is a stylish oven and it has a study feel to it. It works well and is quite nice for the money\u2014a good buy.\n \n  It seems like a very nice toaster oven but it didn\u2019t fit our space so had to return it.\n \n  I am usually only cooking for myself and using my oven is a pain, so I decided to purchase this toaster oven for my small, individual meals. So far, it has worked amazingly. All of my meals come out tasting like it was cooked in a real oven whether it is pizza or chicken. It fits perfectly in my kitchen and isn't too bulky, but powerful enough to heat up my food in an efficient manner.\n \n  Descent size over toaster for everyday use. Its stainless steel and LED light make it look like a premium product in your kitchen. I used it used about everyday mostly for breakfast and lunch. Put a few slices of bread in the morning to heat them up and for lunch I use it to warm up pasta, rice, and mixed vegetables. Very satisfied with the product!\n \n  Only used it a couple times so far but it was easy to set up and use. So far it\u2019s been exactly what I wanted and I\u2019m excited to try some of the recipes  that it came with. \n  Definitely good value for money. I thought it will be a little bit big for my kitchen because it's a small kitchen, but it fits perfectly. Good value for money. I love this multi-function idea! A great addition to my kitchen. All functions works  well and it's very easy to clean it up. I am very satisfied with this toaster oven, it is very functional. Heats up fast.\n \n  Been in the market for a stainless steel toaster oven to match my kitchen and for the size and price point this one is perfect! Heats food great and is an amazing addition to my kitchen.\n ", "\n  Only had this for two days, but so far impressed with the quality and even toasting, both better than the Black and Decker Toast R Oven we had for years (although the Mueller is more expensive).  Toasting is generally the weak link for toaster ovens, so that is good.  The controls are just fine, in contrast to other reviews, and it looks pretty good on the countertop.\n \n  I have not had this over long enough to know. \n  Great smaller toaster oven for a rental I have- nice compact design.  When the door latch broke after I had it over a year,  I called customer service and they sent me a new unit immediately.  Now that is good service!\n None None None \n  \u00a0I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It looks very sturdy and like it would hold up well.  She began using it on 1/2/2020 and on 1/10/2020 this happened, see video.  Very dissappointed.  Trying to fugure out how to return it.\n \n  This oven surpasses my wildest thoughts.  It is easier to use because it has a timer. \n  I was looking for a regular toaster that I could use for reheating breads and making pizza. I don\u2019t understand much about the technology behind it, I just needed something sturdy that will serve me for many years. It works well so far, but again, I only use it to make bread toasts. Hope this helps!\n \n  My last toaster oven was such a pain, I could never use it for toast because I would have one side toasted way too much. I ended up buying a toaster for bread, which cluttered my kitchen. After I bought this toaster oven, I can make toast and not have to worry about flipping it.  Cooks everything else really well and tastes better than using the microwave for me.\n \n  I love this toaster oven so much! It has so many features that other ovens do not have and it does everything very well. The temperature settings are great and allow me to toast or bake many food items. I also really appreciate the fact that it is not obnoxiously large so it fits well in my kitchen. All in all, this toaster oven is small, powerful, and effective.\n \n  A very well made and easy to use oven that comes with two trays, one that is meant to catch crumbs and one that can hold your food. The toaster is pretty easy to clean as well not only because of the crumb tray but also because of the fingerprint-resistant exterior and the interior that makes it pretty hard for food stuff to get stuck to the sides and the inside.\n \n  This appliance is great.  I saved me time and energy.  Very easy to operate and clean. I love it!\n ", "\n  Have only made one thing in it so far so can't give it a higher rating , but the instructions do not tell you where or how the crumb tray is supposed to be used. Took lots of turning the oven around to figure out that there was a crumb tray included. It seems like it will not be easy to empty it.\n \n  The dials are impossible to read, the oven didn\u2019t work, I called customer service and they sent me a return label.\n \n  Works fine just takes a bit long to heat up and smaller than expected. Looks cool.\n \n  Hard to clean.  Crumb tray does not detach.  Hot exterior surfaces will burn you.\n \n  I got this to cook pizzas and chicken nuggets without turning on an oven. Cooks nuggets quickly, and makes them nice and crunchy. I was able to fit half a pizza on the tray. Also doesn\u2019t heat up the whole kitchen.\n \n  Such a great convection oven!  Very easy to use and so much more convenient than using a stove or larger appliance.  It fits under my kitchen cabinets.  I could not be happy for the value!! Would highly recommend!\n \n  Great price and smaller compact size for tight spots. Works incredibly well and easy to clean and use.\n \n  This company was quick to replace the toaster oven that had a hinge break off.  The replacement didn't work AT ALL.  Heater bar would heat up occasionally, no sense to it, but wouldn't ever get  hot enough to toast bread. I would now like a free refund.\n \n  A little smaller than i expected, but works great. Just have to put on my glasses to see the temp settings and such.\n \n  But oven door has broken with moderate use. ", "\n  THE TOASTER OVEN IS WELL BUILT. IT HAS GREAT HEAT DISTRIBUTION. A LITTLE SMALL.\n \n  This is a great product. It's small and doesn't take up much space yet it does so much. Great to make toast or beagles they dont get stuck . Heats up left over pizza and its not soggy. And i don't need to turn the big oven on.\n \n  Its compact and easy to operate. Like any good tool you have to get familiar with the operation. The instructions should emphasize this more.\n \n  I totally love this item!! Compact and sturdy!! Lots of functionality!!! Thanks\n \n  Heats up fast, toast evenly. I like the bell signal when my food is done.  Looks like  better construction than the last toaster. \n  I was looking for a suitable toaster oven to replace my old one and after much research, I decided on this one. My old toaster oven had finally died on me after only 2 years of owning it. I had barely even used it on top of that! I've been using this new Mueller toaster oven for about a month and I'm very pleased with my purchase. Cooks food perfectly and just as I like it.\n \n  We are so happy with this product!!!! Easy to use, lots of options.... great for our busy family!!!\n \n  Waited a couple months to leave a review. This is a great unit for the price. Although some may think it\u2019s a bit small it works for small families.\n \n  I love the design of the product and it fits on my counter perfectly without taking up too much space. It is super easy to use with its 3 knobs controlling the temperature, type of cooking, and a timer. It\u2019s great for cooking when you don\u2019t want to use your oven and it\u2019s supper convenient for reheating foods. I love the product and would highly recommend!\n \n  Very easy to use for cooking fish, harsh brown and toast! I like the temparature switch since it shows fahrenheit and celsius so when I read recipes in different units I don't need to convert.\n ", "\n  Easy to use and gets the job done! I made brownies, toast, heat up pizza, etc.\n \n  I like that the size of the inside of the oven is just about the size of the entire oven, keeping it small, but maximizing space for cooking. I like the three separate disks for time, temperature, and functions. It\u2019s nice that you can select toaster, baking, or broil. Oven is labeled clearly. Easy to read and understand.\n \n  Heats real well.  Hard to judge temperature without a magnifying glass.  Numbers on dials are really small.  Other than that it's ok\n \n  The setup was easy, very simple to use and the best part is quick cleaning.\n \n  Sleek design .  Ez to operate .  Roasts nicely and overall a nice countertop  oven .\n \n  I like how this toaster oven does not emit a burning smell. It cooks food evenly and quick.I haven\u2019t cooked a large piece of meat in it.  I bought to toast waffles and heat up frozen chicken tenders/pizzas\n \n  First of all, I love it because it's much more powerful than the oven I had before. Stainless Steel looks very good in my kitchen, and it's very easy to clean it. Very easy to use all functions, which wasn't cased with my previous toaster oven. It's very easy to make a toast which  also wasn't case with my previous oven. Well designed timer.  I simply love it.\n \n  This is what I use in the mornings to get my breakfast started smoothly. I just plop the bacon onto the tray which I cover with aluminum, because they're going to eventually stain if I don't, and set the timer and get on with the rest of the preparations. They also toast bread really well but I just enjoy the sound of toast popping out in the mornings\n \n  This is a great toaster oven. Its easy to use and it bakes, broils, and toasts beautifully & evenly plus Its not bulky.\n \n  This toaster oven works so well for my kitchen. My biggest thing for my kitchen is that it looks beautiful and doesn't have any bulky, ugly appliances and this toaster oven makes my kitchen look complete and sleek. It goes perfectly in my kitchen and the best part is that it works amazingly!! My food always comes out tasting great and evenly heated.\n ", "\n  I had an issue with this toaster oven cooking evenly. The seller held true to the 2 yr warranty, offering a replacement and/or refund right away at no charge. Wonderful service!! Thank You!\n \n  So far the product has lived up to my expectations. Can\u2019t wait to get years of service from it!\n \n  The oven is very convenient to use, the removable crumble tray is very convenient to clean the inside and temperature control seems pretty accurate. Would definitely recommend this model.\n \n  I love this toaster oven, great deal at a great price.  Its compact so it doesn't waste alot of space, but plenty of room to cook what we want.  Heats up very fast and easy to use.\n \n  We just received our toaster oven and im so glad we picked this one. It looks great, i love the recipe book it came with and its very intuitive to use. So far so good! Ill update this post after i spend a good month using it! Ill post pics of the recipes i make from the book as well\n \n  Heating elements do not turn off.  Thermostat is poor.  I returned it.\n \n  It is the perfect size for my kitchen, works great, and the price was great.....very pleased.\n \n  Of course it makes great toast, but after baking eggs, cooking pizza, and making quesadillas, I\u2019m excited to have this toaster oven. Easy to clean, light weight, and compact great addition to the kitchen.\n \n  A little small but good. I think I could have gotten a larger oven for less\n \n  I bought this for my daughter who lives in VA and she's very pleased with the way it works.  I have no first-hand knowledge.\n ", "\n  The oven rack is too small and falls out of the track when good is on it\n \n  I love the quality and design. Heats up fast and pretty accurate settings. I hope it lasts a long time.\n \n  A great toaster oven at an attractive price. Well made and compact. Easy to use.\n \n  ......but hard to read numbers on dials.....otherwise, good product\n \n  This toaster oven far exceeded our expectations!  Don't hesitate if you are looking for one like this.\n \n  This is such an awesome upgrade from our old toaster oven. The temperature controls are very accurate, and the different zone settings make it easy to cook a variety of different foods. As with an toaster oven, there are parts that are hard to clean, but that is to be expected. Overall this was a worthwhile purchase that I would recommended highly to anyone.\n \n  Great toaster oven.  Heats items well and very easy to use.  My son uses it to both cook and heat his food.  Size is great and fits on a small table.  Definitely would buy it again.\n \n  This is a bit smaller item than we were expecting in terms of how it compared with our last one.  Because it's small we are having trouble keeping things from burning on the bottom......could be operator error but we are following it's instructions.  This one will find it's way to a thrift shop shortly.\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing! Super sleek and beautiful design and the controls are fool proof! Easy to understand the settings and heats and cleans up quickly! I highly recommend this toaster oven!\n \n  When I use the timer function, the toaster shuts off without dinging before it reaches the \u201cOff\u201d tick. This is extremely disappointing as I was attracted to the product design and I like how it looks on my counter, but it just doesn\u2019t function as it should and is so frustrating to use. I would like to know how I can get a replacement that works correctly.\n ", "\n  I bought this to use for my smaller cakes I cook for my coworkers and family members and it's worked great so far. I actually use it for more than just my cakes now, which is something I wasn't expecting and is super convenient. I can cook food for myself very easily and not have to use the kitchen oven.  I just wish it had a longer timer than 30 minutes.\n \n  I was skeptical when I opened this and saw how small it is. But then I plugged it in and gave it a shot... Talk about pleasantly surprised! Not only is this nice and compact on your counter, it does a fantastic job making anything you can fit into it. I've done pizzas, casadilla's, roasted peppers, grilled cheese, chicken... All came out great!\n \n  I am glad I purchased this it works great and does a great job.\n \n  This was a gift from my kids.  Out old toaster oven had been needing replacement for a while.  This was a great surprise.  The oven is the perfect size... not too small but not taking all the counter space.  Appears to work well on all the settings.  Have to remember to set the temperature on the toast setting to get the best results.  All-in-all a great toaster oven.\n \n  I needed a new counter top toaster oven to replace my old one that died a few months ago. I\u2019ve looked at probably every one they make online and settled on this one because it doesn\u2019t take up much space in my kitchen and it\u2019s good quality for the price. I tested it right out of the box and it cooked my pizza slices like a pro, way better than my old one.\n \n  Love this little machine!  Small in size but it does exactly what you need it to.  Priced right and looks sleek.  Love it!\n \n  Just got it and used for the first time. The size is perfect, not taking up much counter space. Controls are easy to read and use. Made perfect toast on the first try.\n \n  Works as  advertised... \n  I like that it's stainless steel and the select knob has an off position. I fixed a 9\" pizza and it cooked it perfectly.\n \n  I use this unit every morning for my toast and peanut butter.\n ", "\n  Like other toasters/ovens there are hot spots on different areas but we are satisfied with the unit.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n \n  I am so happy with th ou s toaster oven. It is super lightweight and small enough where it does not take up a lot of counter space. I have had this for about a week and have cooked several dinners in it, heats up fast and cooks great. No more having turn to turn on my oven to cook meals\n \n  It arrived  early Sunday afternoon. I read through the leaflet, set up was easy and made a grilled cheese sandwich. I don't have a toaster so this comes in very handy. Happy with my purchase.\n \n  We also have an air fryer so this thing isn't getting as much use as it should, but it's perfect for warming up a couple pieces of pizza or whatever we need. I haven't had a problem with it yet.\n \n  Perfect size for our countertop, I like the way it heats and toasts,  I highly recommend!\n \n  Very badly designed. There is one precarious hinge, and when it comes loose, as happened after two uses, there is no way to reattach it. I would return to Amazon but it isn't worth the trouble.

It is not bulky, fits easily on the kitchen top, and is easy to use. It heats up quickly and does most of the job conveniently. Easy to clean as well with the removable bottom tray. It is a fine looking 5 stars oven! Loving it!\n \n  after 15 minutes of making toast I had warm bread.  took 22 minutes to make 2 light brown pcs.  NOT REAL HAPPY, I'm sending it back and will stick to a brand name I know!!!\n \n  I liked my Mueller toaster oven because I can toast bread in a jiffy, bake my personal sized pizzas and heat up my lasagana in a snap.

Even bought my friend one for Xmas.\n ", "\n  It works great and is a nice addition to the kitchen and works great.\n \n  This toaster is smaller than anticipated but works well. It is nice for an office for one person occasional use, but probably not the best option for a family. The only thing to watch is if you set the timer for too long, you can\u2019t adjust it or turn it off early.\n \n  My toaster dies, thought why not combine an appliance... Works well for small jobs to avoid heating the house from the oven. Food with a specific time and temperature works quite well. But I have yet to figure out the settings for normal toast - pale and dry to burnt beyond.\n \n  Could not use it. Turned it on several times for hours and it kept smoking and had a burnt smell. Cleaned inside and kept trying with same problem. Had to return it.\n \n  I finally have a toaster of my own! I love the three functions instead of having one function such as toasting.

Disappointed. They contacted me and said would refund me and not send it back - have not heard anymore from them and no refund.\n \n  This is a lovely, basic toaster oven. So far, I used it in oven mode (highest temperature) to bake frozen rolls, and in toast mode for bread (highest temperature, dark timer setting). I like the understandable control knobs, and also it takes up less counter space than some other models.\n ", "\n  Love this toaster oven! The design is very elegant and easy to use, and the size of the toaster oven is not overwhelming even though it can accommodate a lot of items.

I don't like that the crumb tray is not removable.\n \n  Works well. Had a problem with door staying open but customer service was fantastic, took care of it with no questions asked!\n \n  This product is a great appliance that I use often!

Additionally, It takes up the very little space on my countertop. I'm very satisfied with this product.\n \n  Compact and stylish.

Timer doesn't shut it off, temperature is all over the place. It's clunky and impossible to clean. Buy anything else.\n \n  This  is the third toaster oven I purchase and so far the best.

Packaged well. \n  Good\n \n  The toaster oven came nicely packed and no damage at all has a cook book and detailed directions and so far is working great\n \n  Great toaster oven and even better service from the seller, KN Direct.

Highly recommended!\n \n  I really like the toaster oven I received from m\u00fceller so far it works far better than others I\u2019ve tried and has a nice simple design while still feeling like it is a high quality appliance. I\u2019d give it 5/5 stars. It also unlike a microwave doesn\u2019t ruin your food when it\u2019s reheated.\n \n  Bought this oven for my husband since he is a truck driver and travels for work constantly. He has been complaining how he doesn\u2019t like how microwave food taste so I decided to get him this over. He loves it, always talks about how good the food tastes now and how much he loves it .\n \n  Too new to comment - has different procedures\n ", "\n  I finally have a toaster oven.  This is so convenient and my kids love it.  We can toast waffles, bread, bagels quickly and with ease.  We love it so far!!!  Plus, it is very reasonably priced!\n \n  El horno se mancha cuando pones a hacer algo que no sea pan, y a la hora de limpiar es muy mala, se decolora cuando lo limpias, muy mala calidad\n None \n  ok\n \n  bien\n None \n  Small in size but works phenomenal\n \n  I love it, it\u2019s just what I needed.

German engineering\n \n  I love! Perfect for a quick warm up.\n \n  Love the toaster oven, we even made cookies, baked potatoes and spaghetti squash in it! That was especially helpful since the weather has been so hot. Looks great in the counter also. Had a small issue that was quickly fixed by the seller! Amazing customer service!\n \n  I so far have only used this for toasting bread and making grilled cheese sandwiches and it does those perfectly. The oven did come with a recipe book however and some of those meals look awesome so I'm definitely gonna try a few of them eventually.\n ", "\n  This is a great product. It is the perfect size to fit on my kitchen counter but still is spacious inside for all my toasting, broiling, baking, or re-heating needs.  This toaster oven heats up quickly and evenly distributes heat.  There are also many great settings to choose from as well as a range of cooking temperatures. This oven is easy to operate and is a perfect addition to my kitchen.\n \n  As expected great\n \n  Well I threw it out after a few months ,  didn\u2019t work for toast very uneven  .  Could not read the directions on the dials .  You get what you pay for , on this one\n \n  With my last toaster oven I never baked in it, I only used it for like toast and bagels, but with this one, I decided to give it a try and I am really impressed. I've baked cookies, brownies, casserole and so much more in this toaster oven. Very yummy every time.\n \n  The three modes are something new that I didn't see before. Would love to try it.\n \n  I really love this toaster oven however, the one caveat is that the ticking timer can become extremely annoying. I'm not sure if that is normal with toaster ovens in general because this is the first one I've owned. Other than that it works great!\n \n  Only made toast, but it came out perfectly. The oven doesn\u2019t take up much counter space. Good design.\n \n  This is great toaster oven. Very simple controls that do exactly what they are supposed to do.

A+++\n \n  Unit works well\n \n  This is a great size toaster oven with all the features I was looking for. We use ours for reheating leftovers, cooking for one or two and toasted bread. It takes a little practice to know how long to set the timer to get desired results with toasting. Overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.\n \n  Great oven. The size is perfect!\n \n  It works no better than my old, cheaper toaster oven. The write-up said it would hold 4 slices of bread - wrong!! The numbers on the dials are so small and dim that you have to tip the unit up to see.\n \n  I love this product! Great toaster oven and perfect size not to big!\n \n  At first I really liked this toaster, until the door handle broke. Making so the latch was not holding the door shut while cooking. I ended up returning to Amazon and bought a new different brand toaster at costco\n \n  Bought this to replace my old Black & Decker. Price was good. Fits perfectly under my counter. Not a combo air fryer which leaves your food Frozen in the middle. Timer button is a little hard to turn, but considering it's brand new I'm sure it will loosen up.\n \n  JUNK.  I was excited to purchase this to replace a $10 toaster that lasted 15 years.  It lasted less than 2 weeks - probably 6 uses - before the spring attached to the the glass door failed and then detached enirely. It is now useless and I am about to contact amazon to arrange a return.  I am so disappointed.\n ", "\n  nice size not too big\n \n  Great\n \n  As long as it works well I'm willing to give this 4/3.5 stars but cleaning it can be a pain (see headline). On the first use the tray showed burn outlines even though I've cleaned it several times.\n \n  Great small toaster oven from Mueller--heats fast and evenly, controls easy to use, plenty of room inside for meals for 1-2, sleek design is attractive. Glad I bought it, excellent value for money.\n \n  The quality is good, heats up good, but if you want toast, put the bread in when you enter the kitchen, by the time you have made your breakfast your toast might be done,,takes twice as long as a normal toaster.\n \n  I like the quality of this--BUT it's really small to be used for anything but the basics\n \n  Does just what is described.  Nice construction.  Bakes & Toasts very well\n \n  It is the perfect size, it's compact without taking away from the oven size. It works perfectly and all my food is delicious\n \n  Toasts nixel6\n \n  Great gift\n ", "\n  I bought this to replace our Cuisenart that made an ear splitting noise when toasting was complete. The Mueller is compact, looks nice and most importantly, has a nice comforting ding at the end of toasting. Not inaudible and not ear splitting, just right!\n \n  This is our second olster oven. My wife loves it\n \n  The oven arrived when promised, food heats quickly & evenly. Great temp control\n \n  Just got the toaster oven today - it fits perfectly in our kitchen. Can\u2019t wait to fire it up. Will update soon!\n \n  Perfect size and great function for small, fast meals. A little slow to heat up but no problems. Walls and top do not get too hot. Makes good toast. Love not turning on the stove for small items.\n \n  This toaster oven is amazing. It actually toasts bagels and bread. I use this daily and I'm very happy.\n \n  I like the simplicity of the toaster oven and the additional features. Also, the footprint is not too big as it is being used in an apartment.  I also like the large viewing window.\n \n  Love this toaster oven.  Size is perfect in my small kitchen. The directions for each setting are clear and easy to follow.

Our teenagers can easily use the toaster oven to make a snack after school and in the evenings. It\u2019s been great for quick meals for our busy schedules.\n \n  Can cook a lot of things,better half loves it\n \n  It works well for grilling meat and  I just made a berry cobbler using it. The toaster works great but all three controls on the oven must be used. We like using it in place of our large oven as we live in a hot climate.\n \n  Great little toaster oven so far. Love the temp features and the ability to bake/roast in the summer time without having to heat up my oven.\n \n  The oven is smaller than I anticipated...I don\u2019t think I could get a small casserole inside...and the heat for baking does not create even heat throughout the oven.\n ", "\n  I bought it for the office break room.\n \n  Toast well but other features non existent love \u2764\ufe0f\n \n  Worked fine but door is broken after 5 months. \n  This toaster was not a convection oven.

The temperature isn\u2019t true, it ALWAYS burns the bottom of the food & the timer is off. Too much trouble to box up and ship back so it just sits\n \n  Great toaster oven for the price.\n \n  Size was important since counter space is at a premium. Plus I now have a way to toast delicate breads that are gluten free and no more fishing in toaster slots!\n \n  Bought this for my mom. She says it\u2019s a great size and fits perfectly on the counter. It toasts for breakfast pastries, cooks for great lunch frozen pizzas and bakes chicken perfectly. Great appliance.\n \n  Smaller than I expected, but works great\n \n  Very satisfied with my purchase, much better then a regular toaster. Can't wait to try out the recipe book that came with it.

It fits nicely in my kitchen\n \n  The product looks pretty nice, just like how it described online and easy to use.\n \n  I wanted to find a toaster oven that wasn\u2019t cheaply made and could last time a long time. This product is sturdy and well-made and I trust this brand to deliver a quality product. It does the job and at a great price. Thank you!\n \n  Worked well, like options to control temperature, allow bake toast or broil, and timer. Dislike that when flat tray pulls out, the grid also comes out. Wish tray would come out easier. We\u2019ll see how long it lasts.\n \n  It has decent capacity and doesn\u2019t take up too much room. I prefer not using a microwave, so this is a great alternative to heating food without heating the whole house in the middle of a heat wave.\n \n  I bought this toaster oven because of all the great reviews I read.  I needed something that made great toast,  hopefully I will be as satisfied as others are.  I am very excited about my new Mueller!

My daughter made some small pastries in it and they came out all evenly cooked and , also the toaster oven is very easy to clean ! I would 100% recommend anyone to buy this product!\n \n  Everything great, with the exception of having to flip it to open a latch in order to remove the pan after it cools down to clean it.  Also have to be careful when you pull out tray so that you don\u2019t damage wire.  Everything else is great.\n \n  christmas gift for nyc dweller\n \n  Did not have the tray or rack. Nice quality control job.\n \n  Bought this for my daughter who is on grad school. Visited her recently and learn that the wire shelf inside constantly falls down because it\u2019s too short to fit properly.  This whatever she\u2019s cooking falls, too.\n \n  Not exactly what I expected.  No way to easily turn off the toaster function if toast is getting too dark.  Instructions aren't terribly clear.  However, I am adjusting.\n \n  It heats food thoroughly and quickly.  The cleaning part is never fun, but I really enjoy the toaster oven.\n \n  Overall this is a good toaster over. Heats leftovers well. But the toast control is hard to use, you think that you've put it on medium, but it only toasts for about 15 seconds. The settings are just very small to read.\n \n  Heats very unevenly, temp dial very difficult to set accurately, and the door broke on mine after less than a year of use. Don't be fooled by European make!\n \n  If you need a toaster oven this one is a great item to add to your home. It works great Anna cleans up easily.\n ", "\n  I've been wanting a toaster oven for a while now and this one is great! Affordable and easy to use/clean.\n \n  Perfect size for a small kitchen.

Excellent quality, sharp looking, compact toaster with a wide range of user friendly settings.\n \n  The heating coils are intermittent and the toaster function is not working at all. I expected much better quality from a Mueller, especially for the cost.\n \n  I love how quiet the oven is when cooking.  I have had many that are very noisy.  This one heats up very quickly, which is a plus!\n ", "\n  Smaller item perfect to save counter space, heats quickly and evenly, and like all the heating options. \n  Wonderful product.  Just the right size for me.  Toasts bread perfectly.\n \n  We are very pleased with our new Mueller toaster oven. It is very high quality and seems very durable. The knob controls work very well and seem sturdy. The toaster is lightweight and sleek. It heats evenly. Very well made.\n \n  I love this toaster.  It looks great on my counter!  Toast perfectly bread, bagels and garlic bread. I have used it to cook hash browns and French fries and did it in less time then in my oven, without all the heat.  It does everything I wanted it to do.\n \n  I'm not new at cooking and baking in a toaster oven but I have not been able to regulate it so that it doesn't burn on the bottom of anything I have baked or toasted.\n \n  I would not recommend this to anyone.. Letting on the dials. To small and dim to read, not good at all for making toast. Very cheaply made. Just very dissatisfied with it.\n \n  Unfortunately it was smaller then I thought and the bottom of what I put in there gets cooked fast then the top \"/ my pizza comes out burnt on the bottom and the cheese isn't even melted on top\n \n  Smaller than expected.\n \n  one issue is the toasting option....a little more involved than previous toaster ovens i have had.  The temperature knob has to be turned to a temp in order to toast\n \n  Gets way hotter than it's supposed to and cooks very unevenly. Basically half of whatever I put in is burned while the other half is undercooked. It even melted my oven mitt when I tried to take the pan out\n ", "\n  Excellent Value\n \n  Perfect little toaster oven! Looks nice, works good, perfect size for those small package meals!\n \n  The toaster oven door hinge broke about 32 days.  I have experiencing difficulty getting a replacement .\n \n  It is great for chicken wings reheating things to stay crisp. Extremely easy to clean timer is very accurate for the price this is a wonderful product.\n \n  This is a great toaster, especially for this price point. It looks sleek and has very easy to use knobs. I also really like the fact that you can move the toasting grate to different levels.\n \n  The toaster function doesn\u2019t appear to work. There is a dial to set for darkness and it doesn\u2019t heat up when the dial is on that setting. Unhappy with product and would return it if I could.\n \n  Bought this toaster less than a year ago. Worked ok until last week when the door broke. The door is on the crappiest hinge I could imagine and there's only one hinge. So now it's useless unless I want to stand there holding the door closed. While it was functioning it was only ok. Now I've learned you get what you pay for\n \n  While its called a toaster oven, it has bake and broil features. I subscribe to online meal delivery kits and most of their recipes require an oven. This proved to be a good replacement for an oven for a short term stay in another city.\n \n  Delivered with broken handle!\n \n  There is no convection feature to this and it is half the size advertised. This is my first deception sild on amazon. Do not buy it!\n ", "\n  This was a gift. Recipient was highly satisfied.\n \n  The toaster handle gets so hot it will burn you.

It does get Very hot if at the highest temp for a while, but not a big surprise, just beware.\n \n  The timer is a little noisy with the beeping and the sound of time up is very loud.\n \n  This toaster oven cooks really well, wether just toasting bread or cooking a small amount of meat or veggies for 2 people. I end up using the toaster oven more often than the main oven for small meals such as kabobs or 12oz of fish.\n \n  Do not buy this product.  Toaster oven doesn\u2019t have a pre-heat option so food burns.  I\u2019ve had it less than two months and the toaster control shuts off mid-cycle.  Too late by 4 days to return so I\u2019m stuck with an inferior product.\n \n  I\u2019ve used it a few times & enjoyed it.  I like the size.  I know you can\u2019t go wrong.\n \n  I am very unhappy with this purchase. The heat distribution is not even and because of where the rack can be placed, the food is either burnt on top and undercooked on the bottom or vice verse. I would not recommend.\n \n  I ordered this item for our office and it's a great little oven.  It has 4 features, bake, broil, toast and convection and the price is right.

Forget having to throw them in the washing machine, just rinse them under some warm water and they are as clean as new. Excellent product!\n \n  I find these a little hard to hang onto. I didn\u2019t get rid of the cloth hot pads for that reason. I love the look and the gloves are awesome I pulled pizza at 475 degrees out of the oven and felt nothing with them  the square ones are good to put on the table to set a hot dish on  Mine found a home  When my boys cook they always grab these verses the cloth ones\n \n  This is my second set of these.  The last ones met an untimely death after being left too near the gas burner - yikes!  Until then, they were great.  I like that they're thin so that I have better control.  When I found these, I threw out all the bulky ones. These are far safer for the various cooks around here. The little square potholders work well as trivets too.  Great product.\n \n  I have the glove ones that fit over each finger, I love the control of grabbing things but they didn\u2019t hold up to heat very well and I had to move quickly. \n  I'm terrified of heat and burns. These are thin and scare me. I have not gotten burned or any real reason besides anxiety to worry but can feel the heat unlike the thick cotton ones. Especially between the thumb and pointer fingers. I just move REALLY fast and do not test it. The squares however work perfect to protect the counters and table from plates.\n \n  Oh my goodness these are nice...I finally replaced my old one that were over 10 years old, they were at the point that you had to tilt your hand at a certain angle and grab fast. These are so luxurious lol! I was seasoning my cast iron Dutch oven that sat in the over for an hour at 400 degrees, I couldn\u2019t even feel the heat when I pulled it out! \n  I love this set of oven mitts. \n  I prefer an oven mitt that extends up the arm as that is where I have burned myself before.  For my use, they could even be longer for long reaches into the oven.  I put the black rubber trivet on the stove-top and place my hot casserole on it and it takes the heat just fine.  The honeycomb pattern is a little hard to wash & dry but I am pleased with this set still.  The mitts are thick and have a rubber palm and rubber back, either mitt is both left and right-handed, and definitely protects you from burns; but I wish they were even longer.\n \n  These oven mitts are the best I've had so far.  Good heat resistence, easy to clean with the silicone hand area (just rinse under the faucet) and the lining is material and comfortable as opposed to all silicone gloves.  They look nice too if you were to give them as a gift. \n  We were looking to replace our old cloth style oven mits we had for 15-20 years.  I did not know that the silicone mits existed until searching on Amazon!  With a little reluctance, we went ahead and purchased them. After a month or so of use, I can honestly say the silicone mits work great!  The silicone  its are easily rinsed off, you can use them to open jars, and of course, pull hot items out of the oven.\n ", "\n  This is a great set. And maybe others out there that are just as good or better but I'm happy with these. I've been trying to find some oven mitts that actually keep my hands from burning. I must have seven or eight different pairs and all they're good for is cleaning windows. I got these in WoW! They actually work! No matter what I take out of the oven it doesn't burn my hand. I also like to use them when I open jars. Helps me get a better grip and they can open much easier. Great product great price recommend\n \n  After looking through the reviews, I decided to buy the mitts and trivets. I had them in 2 days with Prime and I'm really impressed with the quality. The mitts are a bit oversized for my hands, but I'm not complaining. I'm a guy and have large hands, so if you have smaller hands, just consider this. Plus, I think their customer service is excellent as well. I sent them an email as directed to register the product for warranty purposes as directed, told them I really liked their product. Within 24 hours or so, they responded with this: \n  Sadly I can\u2019t recommend these oven mitts. They look nice and handle hot pans nicely, but after a week of regular use, one split as shown in photo. Wish they were made better.\n \n  My wife should have got a pair of these long time ago. She was a late starter to cooking in her 30s and despite common sense to use pot-holders she didn't have a pair.  I noticed she would always use dish cloths or something to pickup hot items from stove or oven. I saw these on amazon somehow one day and said problem solved. Now she uses them every time, they pack in to a kitchen drawer well and have sturdy rubber gripping on both sides to get a better grip. Handy for slick cookware like a greasy pan or pizza tray\n \n  Let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all accidentally caught a potholder on fire or atleast toasted one near our stove we forgot was on. These oven mitts are dang near indestructible and I love them! I bought them as a last attempt to prevent my mom and I from ruining all our fancy cloth ones and they\u2019ve held up great! You can easily use the mittens to grab heavy dishes from the stove while the small squares are great to rest hot pots on or to grab a cookie sheet. They\u2019re also very easy to clean which is and added bonus all through sometimes those little holes need a thorough scrubbing. Over all a really great product\n \n  After years of using fabric/cotton oven mitts that ALWAYS looked dirty, dingy and stained, I saw these at a friend's house. I was skeptical and afraid that I would burn myself because they were so thin and flexible. Be Not Afraid! These are awesome! These look great, work great, clean up perfectly and will provide years of happy baking!\n \n  These are great! The mitts aren't too big or small, they have a comfortable lining, and provide a great grip when lifting hot pans, etc. I used my heavy cast iron skillet in a 400 degree oven and had no problem handling it. The potholders are also very handy when you need a trivet to put a hot pot or casserole on the counter or table. \n  Great deal for the money. These look like decent quality mitts. I will say that my first use was seasoning my new cast iron pan. When taking it out of the oven I was able to feel heat through the mitts, but the pan was also 500 degrees so I wouldn't expect anything to be able to hold that for long. I'm really surprised at the quality of the pot holders that came with.\n \n  These are seem to be very high quality mitts, they are very comfortable inside and you cant even feel any warmth coming in. \n  The difference in the color of the fabric and silicone is off-putting and stark. Also the silicone on the gloves felt cheap and had a sticky rubber-like texture. I did not attempt to use these, just returned them.\n ", "\n  This is a chemical rubber mitt which can withstand being on the surface of the sun yet ... it is wrapped in a plastic bag. Why? Hatred for the ecosystem? Hatred for biology? Hatred for all life forms? \n  Good looking and I like the length of for protection, but that\u2019s about it. Not sure why others are saying they insulate from heat well, it\u2019s minimal. I used them to pull a pan out of the oven and as I was removing the contents I could feel my hand heating up fast. I finished up quickly, but will not use these again for that purpose. Seems like they would be better as the picture shows, maybe holding a pan handle to stabilize a pan. Please don\u2019t depend on these!\n \n  They are not as heat resistant as they should be. With the glove on you still feel a small burn.\n \n  Having arthritis it is difficult to bend my hands and these mitts add  a bunch of resistance.  The potholders do not do a very good job of protecting hands from heat.  I wish I had looked a little harder and got some old fashioned ones.  I will have to say they are easy to clean. \n  Use these to take my cast iron pans out of the oven.  You immediately feel the heat through these.  Not enough to burn you, but you definitely want to put the pan down quickly.  Not unhappy, but not thrilled. They will suffice.\n \n  The gloves are long enough to protect your arms from steam and heat \n  The mitts themselves are too bulky .The square pot holders are not very heat resistant and the material is extremely slippery.\n \n  I got it originally for my husband as a present, since he does not like to buy anything for himself to enjoy life. My husband loves cooking, he cooks for fun every day and keeps it as a hobby. He always complained about burning himself in the past and actually on average every third day he burnt himself. Since we have this he can hold a heavy cast iron for a long time and never feels anything. I already washed the product once for him in a washing machine, I have no idea if they recommend this to be washed in a washing machine but it is extremely durable. We have it for over two months now and the product is amazing. If you want a good quality product that will also protect you from the oven burns or cast iron burns, it is worth it. The gloves look also really elegant in the kitchen.\n \n  Overall, these are great mitts. I was disappointed that it didn't resist heat as much as you'd suppose it would. I could feel quite a bit more heat than I wanted when I pulled a pizza stone out of the oven at 550 degrees. I almost burned my hands. \n  These are great oven mitts.  They have good arm length so you dont have to worrk about anything burning your arms either. ", "\n  The hand potholder is great, but the square rubber potholders are not flexible enough to be called potholders...more like something to set a hot pot on. I thought this was a poor deal for me.\n \n  They were quality made oven mitts. I have large hands and they fit perfect as well as goes partially up my arm making a comfortable fit. The only thing is one of my loop hangers came undone but I grabbed a needle and thread and easily fixed it. No need to return because the style, function, comfortable fit and durability outweighed the glitch of a stitch coming out. I would definitely recommend as well buy again. Thank you for making a quality oven mitt that will surely get many uses for a long time.\n \n  These are by far the best oven mits and hot pad. They have a great grip that makes transferring dishes in and out if the oven really easy and I\u2019m never worried about placing my pots and pans on top of my counter or table with the pads underneath. I\u2019ve had other oven kits where holes have burned through the finger tips on the mit but these ones seem to be heat resistant and are just really well made. So happy with my purchase.\n \n  Shipped super quick. Very durable. Love that you can wash things right off of them. Couldn't feel any heat through them holding a 400\u00b0 pan for a few moments. I enjoy that they came with silicone pot trivets too. Very nice for the $$$. The blue is a beautiful blue.\n \n  I can safely grab oven sheets out after baking using these. They work perfectly, however, the inner lining of cloth isn't anchored to anything so if you have big hands and remove the glove, the lining gets pulled inside out. The thumbs are a bit awkwardly shaped, but those are really minor complaints.\n \n  It is officially the best kitchen aid I got from Amazon. The color is true to picture.size is perfect for both me and hubby. It does not transfer heat or steam. Some people mentioned the square tiles are too hard to bent and should only be used to rest a pot but you can see in the picture, they are bentable. Loved them thanks for the great product. \n  So far I really like this product! The outer material seems like very durable silicone and the inside of the gloves feels quite nice. I found myself putting them on last night just to feel how soft they were again. \n  I bought this for the bacon lover in my life.  They always cook it in the oven and get grease all over my nice potholders/oven mitts.  I wanted to go with the silicone mitts since I could just wipe the grease off of them!  The mitts have met my expectation in that regard.  I have noticed the potholders are on the thinner side so if you're using them to handle extremely hot items be prepared to sit that item down ASAP (I like to bake and noticed this while trying to rearrange my cookies sheets.). \n  I have burnt my hands a thousand times, until one day I had enough. Boy, did I make the right decision. The mits are light weight and still deflect the heat. \n  Very good set of oven mitts that are not overly large.  I have small hands (these mitts don't fit like a glove)  yet I am able to grab hot pans out of the oven with these mitts.  I love the fabric inside the mitts very soft and flexible.  Great color on these HOMWE mitts.  Also, the 2 little pot holders are handy, they have this honeycomb design that does help you hold onto a smaller plate or soup bowl when removing it from the microwave.  These kitchen supplies  are worth the money!!\n ", "\n  We had this wierd one piece oven mitt, my husband couldn't figure it out. So I got him these and he loves them. Easy to clean, great heat resistance. Love that they came with hot pads too. Happy that my husband has stopped using our dish towels as oven mitts as well.\n \n  My oven mitts were old and clumpy cotton batting and, if they got damp, did absolutely nothing for heat resistance. Adding these to my kitchen has been so nice. They're flexible, comfortable, the right size, and I don't worry at all about burning my fingers through the mitt anymore!\n \n  WISH I WOULD HAVE purchased these sooner! Could have saved myself from getting burnt! Seems to be made very well! When baking Pizza\u2019s set oven to 450 Degree feel no heat at ALL same when pulling out cookie sheets grabbing a hot potato\u2019s from the oven!  No problem for me! I was scared at first thinking the heat would penetrate through but my new gloves/mitts worked well! Even when pulling pots from the oven mitts worked very well! I have not washed or wiped them down to clean them yet.  The bonus rubber squares for opening are always nice to have.\n \n  Love this set. Great material, easy for clean up if I accidentally get some food on it while cooking. I also used it to hold my cast iron as I wash it while it\u2018s hot since the material is water resistant and I have never had a problem with the heat!\n \n  Love the longer glove sleeves for getting items out of the oven.  Mitts grip great with no heat exchange to my arms or hands.\n \n  I love love love these oven mitts! The cheap ones I was using before kept catching on fire and quickly ended up covered in holes and so they no longer did what they were supposed to do. These are SO comfortable, easy to grab things with them on, and very heat resistant. I would buy these again and again.\n \n  I hated to spend this much money on potholders (as compared to the Dollar Store)  but I was down to only one that I really trusted not to get burned with. These are very substantial and I use them with confidence. I'm happy with my purchase.\n \n  These are perfect oven mitts and mats. I have butcher block countertops, so they are easy to mess up if you put something right out of the oven on them. The mats protect my countertops and the grip on the mitts make it super easy to pull things out of the oven.\n \n  I put some stuff in the oven at 500F on a sheet pan and the heat comes through the gloves, albeit a little slowly. It will eventually burn you though, I feel, if you hold it long enough. The pads are too small to use effectively, but you can put them on a counter to prevent scorching.\n \n  These are actually better than expected. They are comfortable, easy to clean and withstand temperatures of 400+ degrees Fahrenheit in my experience. I've also used the pot holders as coasters because the bee comb style surface gathers some liquid before spilling over. I'm happy with the purchase\n ", "\n  I'm using these mittens to handle hot pots and baking sheets, mostly.  The material does a good job protecting my hands from the heat and hot surfaces. \n  Washed beautifully in the washing machine and dried in the dryer. Very well made. Protects the fingers, and top and bottom of the hand with padding and silicone. I am very please with this product\n \n  Bought this moving into my own apartment and could not be disappointed. Can easily grab pans and pots with the mittens without any discomfort or heat. The things you put hot things on are perfect and do not cook the countertop. They all have holes to hang them up on the oven with some hooks. These look, feel, and function perfectly. Extremely happy with this purchase.\n \n  Wanted long gloves to protect my forearms and these work well, but heat did penetrate the gloves when I had to hold my 430 degree Dutch oven. Will keep searching for a glove that can withstand higher steps.\n \n  These gloves are thin and don\u2019t protect your hands at all.  Very specifically, where the thumb meets the rest of the oven mitt is very thin, which caused burns with first use.\n \n  After having the same cloth oven mitts for years, it was finally time to upgrade. I wanted silicone ones for cleanliness but was worried about how heavy, large, and stiff the mitts would be. These are very lightweight and malleable so easy to grab even heavy dishes from the oven. VERY easy to clean. Will never go back to cloth. Everybody Needs these!\n \n  It was a gift that topped them all!! Both of them were walking around the house and across the street wearing them. Fighting over who gets to wear them. Now I'm getting a second set for my wife because she is mad because of how nice they are. Even though we already have drawer full.\n \n  I was looking for a product that was economical, but did not skimp on safety.  Over the Labor Day weekend, we finally had the chance to put these to use at our bar b q.  So far,  the products, which consists of 2 pot holders and 2 good size gloves, seem to be the perfect solution for what I was looking for.  Thank you!\n \n  You do feel the heat if holding the hot pots for long, Grip is not too good for small handles, too bulky, material is not good.\n \n  The pads I use as a place to set pans on bc they're hard to clean if you use them as pot holders and get food on them. They're like mini suction cups lol. The mitts are stiff but very heat resistant.\n ", "\n  I bought the blue color and it is slightly brighter than the picture. When I placed my hand inside it felt very comfy but the material inside heats up causing my hand to sweat. The silicone does it\u2019s job but the inside fabric needs improvement. As for the two pot holders, they have a good thickness to place under hot pots or baking items.\n \n  Having worked in a kitchen before as a cook, I've definitely used a ton of oven mits and place mats.  These are by far my favorite.  They looks great, they're not bulky, and do a great job protecting my hands and counters.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to pick up a set.\n \n  These are really nice oven mitts. They're sturdy, thick, easy to clean, and fit anyone. And I like that both sides of each mitt have the heat resistance so you can use it no matter whether you're right or left handed.n\n \n  Love these oven mitts ! I do wished I wouldn\u2019t have bought them in black for they show up food to easily , but a spin in the washer helps and they come really clean .\n \n  I recommend these, quality and craftsmanship seem good. I've had them for about a month and they're working as expected. Easy to clean as well.\n \n  The silicon squares seem to let the heat through if you hold a certain way for too long and are a little awkward to grip. They all look really nice tho and the color is very vibrant.\n \n  These are excellent oven mitts.  For the price I was expecting something of lesser quality and they seem like a very high quality oven mitt.  They really keep out the heat and the silicone is no slip and makes lifting out dishes very easy to handle.\n \n  Excellent product! The oven mitt is made very well. Thick, washable, heat proof. The two pads for the countertop are also of excellent quality. A great package deal for the price. I bought two more for gifting!\n \n  These are the best oven mitts I've ever used! No heat at all. Great quality ! \n  What can I say but, I love these mitts and pot holders. I was always burning my hands from cloth products.  No more burns now. I highly recommend them!\n ", "\n  I love these Silicone Oven Mitts and Pot Holders. Very heat resistance on my hands and fits like a glove.  Matching pot holder works like it says also I can layed it on my coffee table (solid wood table) and my dining glass table to put hot pot on it. Absolutely no marks or heat  on the table. I choose gray because everything on my house is the similar color theme.\n \n  Great quality, especially for the price. This is my first pack of silicone mitts and potholders, and I\u2019m hooked. They grip super well and are easy to clean. There\u2019s no concern for hot dishes sliding around.\n \n  375\u00b0 pan can be felt through these within 5-10secs.  Except for that I love the grip and easy clean of them\n \n  Very good gloves, good for straight out of the oven pans. These are the best mitts I have ever seen. I have large hands and I have no problem putting these on.\n \n  Much better than the cloth mitts I was using before. This price would be good for the mitts alone - the trivets are a welcome addition and unexpected at this price point\n \n  Love these mittens and love the fact that they didn\u2019t cost a small fortune. Great for pulling things out of the oven even with the temperature on broil. The pot holders keep my counter top or kitchen table from being ruined by a hot pan. Overall, I Would buy again.\n \n  These gloves are long , comfy, have a great grip, and are easy to clean. I have what I'd consider regular-sized hands and they're a little large in the grip, but overall couldn't be happier. They're the only gloves I've come across that work great for both me and my husband. When I reach into the oven I'm confident I won't get a burn, no matter how far in I'm reaching. Love the black color too - easy to clean, and can't tell when they're not clean!\n \n  Absolutely perfect. Nice quality material. Now, I don't have to worry about burning myself on the stove or oven. Really like these.\n \n  Really like this set for my grey and white kitchen and also the quality is very good.  Love the gloves. Nice it includes two. the hot pads work well to insulate my counter top and look trendy.  Good value.\n \n  Fast shipping.  Great quality.  Perfect size.  Work great, if you hold something hot for really long you can feel the heat slightly.\n ", "\n  Could look way better, look kind of cheap. Also doesn't do a great job of keeping the heat off my hands. Expected a lot more.\n \n  These are the best!  I bought one set for a bride to be and one for myself.  I loved the flexibility and light weight of the mitts and the black trivets worked well on my new counter to protect it from hot foods.  I loved these so much,  I bought a set for each of my adult children!  Not only do they work great in the kitchen, but they are handy for grilling, as well,\n \n  Very nice.  They are protective silicone on the outside with fabric in the inside of the mits from about the wrist down.  Comfortable and nice looking.  The trivets will come in handy as well.  I am going to order another set for just about everyone.  Christmas shopping in June.\n \n  I was skeptical of this really working.  I did not burn myself using them, which for me is the most important feature.\n \n  Barely have the time to make a review. I like the product, but the same day this was delivered I used it and the material may be cheap because it ripped immediately. I don\u2019t use it enough to know how poor material is just yet so I can update later, but I\u2019m upset I don\u2019t even have the option to hang these if I wanted.\n \n  Mitts work great. The potholders are fine for trivets but not to grab with; too thin and liable to burn your hands. Also a pain to wash trivets with honeycomb design.\n \n  The gloves are pretty good. The squares are ok if you use them as a non-slip mat to put a hot pan on, not so much holding a hot pan. Heat still radiates right through the thin silicon very quickly. The gloves are ok if you don't hold onto a hot item for too long.\n \n  Im happy with the purchase. Good value for the money. The glove-type workd perfect. The square one gets a little hot at times.\n \n  These things are great and truly feel super high quality. I can't believe the price they're listed at! Very thick sturdy mitts and we use the pot holders for everything here because they're so flexible. I used them just the other day to unscrew a hot light bulb!\n \n  These are perfect for my kitchen. Beautiful set, and dies what it\u2019s supposed to do! Protects my hands from the heat perfectly. Easy to clean.\n ", "\n  These are heat pads/mitts. Don\u2019t have any strenuous jobs. No melting, disfigurement, or discoloring noted yet. \n  Great upgrade from cotton mitts. We found these mitt provide superior steam protection such as when opening a lid. The pads can slide if the surface is wet and smooth such as a stone countertop.\n \n  I have another pair of mits also made of silicon, but these are much better, I don't worry about not being able to hold on to the hot pans, or accidentally dropping them, These are great!\n \n  Love love love these mitts. So tired of burnt fingers with cotton mitts. These work easy to clean Im happy!! THX\n \n  I like the silicone mats but the mitts are not great if you have contact with a pan for more than 30 seconds or so. I cook with cast iron often and these are not as heat protective as I would like.\n \n  Like all silicone gloves they're slick especially when wet. But they keep the heat out, seem to work well so far. Would purchase again if needed.\n \n  Been using these for a month now and have yet to even feel warmth while I\u2019m using the gloves!\n \n  Excellent over the past few months of use.  They cover a considerable part of your arms without being combersome.  You can confidently handle hot things.  Rather nice looking too.\n \n  I\u2019m so glad I bought these! They are so soft on the inside, which wasn\u2019t a quality I was looking for necessarily, but they are perfect in every way.\n \n  My husband bought these for me because my old oven mitts I had were run down! I do love how the silicone is by the fingers because we have a pretty small oven and I often times will get the tips of the fingers in the food. It\u2019s easy clean up and seems to be great quality!\n ", "\n  I did so much research before buying this particular type/ brand and I\u2019m glad I did. I have absolutely no regret. It works great, I never feel the heat and I use my oven a lot. It\u2019s very easy to clean and worth the price.\n \n  Like the silicone mitts for cooking, baking, and trivets. But they\u2019re not as flexible as the cloth mitts.\n \n  We needed to update our pot holders and these were a great buy!  They are nice looking and made of good materials.  They are easy to clean and I can feel any heat through them when I use them with the oven.\n \n  Great mitts! Love the silicone on the hands for added heat protection. Nice soft inside. And the silicone trivets are a nice bonus!\n \n  We had been burning ourselves with old gloves...  And we did not have anything great to our or hot dishes on.  We got 2 for one and we love it.\n \n  I'm very happy with these mits and pads. They really are easy to clean and so nice to use. I'd highly recommend!\n \n  Takes a bit getting used to. They work like a charm. Definitely worth the buy.\n \n  Surprised at the amount of heat these take without feeling it. Mitts start out a little stiff, but become flexible after a couple uses. Hot pads are great as non slip pads for casseroles.\n \n  I really liked this set. The mitts fit great and are very comfortable on this inside. The addition of the two silicone trivets just adds to it. I'd absolutely recommend it. The only issue is that when I put the Right Mitt on, it fuses to my skin and I channel the power of Rand Al Thor, the Dragon Reborn. I am able to summon the one true power and bring down my enemies, dare they challenge me! The Mitt of Despair gives me lightning quick sword skills and I am able to attack with effortless strokes with a painter's precision. Also, the trivets are great at opening stuck jar lids.\n \n  my previous oven mitts BURNED OFF MY HANDS, so this was such a relief to come across. they're not the cutest but they are very thick material, easy to clean (just wipe off excess) and cook with ease. very happy about this purchase\n ", "\n  Just what we were looking for. A gift to give for the kitchen, thank you.\n \n  Nice sized, useful good looking mats. Mittens are slightly big for me, but that's  quiet alright. Only minor irritation is the drying part, water gets deposited in the design. But that is not a big deal. I would  still go for it.\n \n  The silicone is definitely different from the traditional gloves but they work great!\n \n  Gloves are great, they work as advertised if not better. The silicon is great and they do well in the oven, on the stove or over the steamer\n \n  I use these to take stuff out of my oven and and grilling... great to have..\n \n  I love these so much. I dont know what I ever waited so long to ge silicon pot holders. They are far superior than the cloth ones and they dont look gross when you accidentally touch food with them because they easily wipe off\n \n  These work great. My wife and I are very pleased with these. They can handle the heat and are durable.\n \n  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. The gloves and pot holders are a good size,  durable, and easy to clean .\n \n  Received this as a gift.  It\u2019s a great set.  Love that it is silicone.  Works great!\n \n  The oven mitts might look kind of stiff but they actually super flexible and the insides are very soft and comfortable. Great length so it protects your fore arm. Love how it also came with in a set.\n ", "\n  Awesome set, didn\u2019t even realize it came with two pot holders as well. They work great as trivets also. Full gauntlet cuff is great in to the oven or reaching over the grill. \n  You could pay more for similar products, but you wouldn\u2019t get a better outcome. It protects my hands and table excellently.\n \n  They are truly heat resistant but quite slippery so be careful.\n \n  extremely hard to wash.  and since they are black, they always look dirty\n \n  These were purchased for my mother (age 75) and she absolutely loves them. She's so excited that she's no longer getting oven burns from using cheap, or very old alternatives. The silicone is easy to clean, light weight, flexible and she loves them.\n \n  These arrived nicely packaged, and I really like them..they work well, look great..potholder work well, haven't used mitts yet, but I'll use on Thanksgiving..look like they are well made..would recommend!\n \n  Definitely a must buy.

Great purchase!\n \n  Product works well so far\n \n  Zxx\n \n  My second purchase of these after I accidentally left the old ones when I moved. Everyone should have a set. They make a great gift.

The honeycomb pattern is hard to clean and for a kitchen item, that is not a good thing.  They also have gotten cut a number of times.  I would never buy these again. \n  Terribly disappointed. Not heat resistant.\n \n  Received this set for Christmas. We use the mitts when we smoke meats on our Pit Boss (I'm always burning my forearms on the lid). Great for removing foil wrapped food off the grill. We use the pot holders as coasters for our drinks as well as using them for hot pots. By far our favorite gift of the year!!\n \n  These are pretty neat.  They are all fabric inside, which make them comfortable to wear.  And I know with the silicone if I put a wet hand in the glove I won\u2019t end up getting burned.  They can go on either hand and fit small and large hands.  The potholders are light weight but big enough to use without burning yourself accidentally.\n \n  The oven mitts are well made, and do a great job of protecting your hands from heat. They have a good grip to them, so removing glass dishes from the oven is easier than using all-fabric mitts. One small thing that surprised me is how soft these were on the inside. The potholders are large and made from a very flexible silicone with a honeycomb pattern. I've also use them as trivets and to open stubborn jars. Overall a very nice and useful set.\n \n  Gave this as part of a wedding shower gift. It was on their registry and I was impressed with the quality. The bride loved it.\n \n  I normally put a 4-star review because there is always room to grow but I got these mitts for my mom for Christmas. she loves them a lot they are nicely soft and comfortable on the inside and strong and amazing grip on the outside and they are so easy to clean the price is amazing for this quality.\n \n  Unlike cotton mitts theses actually do not get hot while handling hot stuffs. Theses are super easy to clean. The pot holders are very useful. I use them on my dinning table for keeping hot pots. The only thing that I found is a bit to be taken care of that the cotton ling under the silicone material is smaller and will make you feel that you have the hold of the pot when you might not actually have it. So need to be extra careful about that.\n \n  My wife has used many, many different oven mitts and these are preferred to the more expensive ones that she has used. Buy these, they are well worth the money!\n ", "\n  Exactly the gift she wanted and it arrived just in time for holiday baking!\n \n  very nice\n \n  These silicone oven mitts are absolutely must-have kitchen items.  I used them yesterday while baking at 450 degrees, and never felt any heat.  I've now gotten rid of all my cloth mitts and potholders\n \n  Just received it and i love it,it's just like the picture\n \n  Work and feel great.  I am happy with my purchase.\n \n  great cho8ce cones i  handy for my wife\n \n  Awesome product!!\n \n  Man these are awesome. Got them for mother's day for my wife.\n \n  Nice. Sturdy without being too heavy! Going to last a long time! Safe.\n \n  First off, the manufacturer literally is willing to give it to you free all you have to do is say you don't like it, but that's the beauty of it. I love these oven mitts, they're really well made. I threw away that coupon that states how to get a full refund if I disliked them because of how much I liked them. Definitely would buy again if these fall apart within a year. The inside lining is very soft, it's like putting your hand in a soft cloud. The outside material have had absolutely no problem taking my oven meals without burning my hands, I don't even feel a little warmth from holding it and placing it on the stove, again they're very well made. Great product.\n ", "\n  I admit, I'm a klutz. I used to use potholders to take pans out of my oven, which didn't give me a very good grasp, and resulted in burnt knuckles and fingers. I tried other oven mitts but the fabric ones didn't help much and the silicone mitts never quite fit right over my long fingers. \n  Positives: The gloves are effective at blocking heat from small things like the handle of my cast-iron frying pan, and go a good bit of the way up your forearm which is nice if you're reaching into an oven.  They also have a nice texture for gripping when I'm struggling to open a mason jar or something like that. \n  These mitts allow natural hand movement and do not constrict your hand.  (I'm a man with fairly large hands) They are so natural feeling that you don't even notice them on. I forgot I didn't have them on the other day because they feel natural when they are on. Also they withstand the heat much better than many conventional hot pads I have used. Being silicone, they also clean well though I wouldn't advise washing them in a machine.\n \n  Love that these wipe clean.. I\u2019ve ruined so many cute pot holders by getting them dirty and then ruining them by trying to put in washer. These are great!! Plus the square ones are excellent for opening jars and stuff.\n \n  I bought for the pot holders. They are great. Work well to prevent burning my arms when taking things our of the oven. The trivets turned out to also be great, I use them all the time now. Both can easily be washed at the kitchen sink. Cloth potholders have to go through the laundry and then wait to dry. These just hand wash and they are ready to go again and totally block all heat.\n \n  No complaints, only praises! Love this set! Very sturdy, long-lasting quality. My boyfriend and I tried other oven mitts that didn\u2019t last too long or would wear down easily. After buying these, I never had to buy another pair again! I recommended them to my parents to buy for their own house & seems like they love it so far. The silicone truly makes it heat resistant. I never feel the extreme heat and haven\u2019t gotten burnt once with these. Must have investment for the kitchen!\n \n  They are so much easier to use than the normal brand that you get at like Wal Mart.........those are bulky and clumsy to use. These, I can put my hands in and really feel that I've got a grip on the pan that I am pulling out of the oven. My husband spilled some sauce on one and it was so easy to clean! Really liking these. \n  These work way better than expected.  I constantly use cast iron pans in the oven and these negate all the heat even after holding for long periods.  Easy to bed around handles and use to place hot pots on tables.  If they get dirty just wash them in dishwater and let dry.  I did i ever use cloth ones before.  Nice modern look as well.\n \n  I\u2019ve only used the oven mits one time so far, but I really liked how they felt on my hands. I have smaller hands and I didn\u2019t think they were too big, as some reviewers have indicated. They seem to be made really well. I\u2019ve never owned silicone mits, but I sure do wish I purchased them years ago. They are very flexible and I feel much more confident carrying hot glass baking dishes with the silicone mits than with the old cloth mits I had. I\u2019ll update my review if there are any changes the more I use them.\n \n  They are cute, but man they do not protect from heat. Went to grab something out of the hot oven, and my hands felt the heat within seconds.\n ", "\n  After spending a lifetime using cloth pot holders and mits... this is a very poor substitute. The little nooks in the pot holders get filled with grime and are not easy to clean. The mitts are not comfortable to use. I'm retiring these to the grilling area outside.\n \n  Resisted heat when taking pans out of the oven compared to fabric gloves. Love that if you touch a bit of the food in a dish while taking it out, you can simply rinse the glove off without needing to put in the laundry and then wait until you\u2019re ready to do a load.\n \n  These are solid oven mitts. I bought these to match with my kitchen decor and the fact they have the silicone mats too. I was contacted the by the seller and reminded that they have lifetime warranty and if anything is wrong with them to contact them for a replacement or money back; I live that they stand behind their product. Recommend to purchase.\n \n  We love these!!! We always used cotton mitts before and you could feel the heat coming through and eventually we started to get burned. I bought these and couldn\u2019t be happier. The outside is silicon and the inside is cotton and polyester. Super comfy and we did not feel any heat when using. Great product!!\n \n  I finally bit the bullet after getting burned one too many times using fabric mitts with holes all around the fingertips. These have held up amazing, even with the oven on 450 degrees. The silicone has been great at holding up and the potholders are an added bonus. These fit my hands perfectly, as well as my husbands (and he has huge hands!). I would recommend these!\n \n  Stands up to high temps - even use while grilling to grab grill pans off high temp, direct heat.  I wash the silicon parts with dish soap and a cloth...even submerging in dishwater.  So far have had to only spot clean cloth parts.  Highly recommend.\n \n  These are functional, however they don\u2019t feel thick and made with quality in mind. I\u2019ve purchased better quality from stores like Ross or Marshalls. \n  This is just such a barganza deal, everybody order these! Seriously, I've had a succession of crap oven mitts over thirty years, these are keepers. Taking a roasting pan out of the oven, and cookie sheets too, nary a hot spot felt through them. The potholders too, super insulation, far better than previous silicone products, even I K E A ones that seemed to work well. Nope.\n \n  These gloves are super light. They fold easily into a kitchen drawer. They handle the heat great- no issues using to get things out of the oven, using hot cast irons, etc. I like the color black so it doesn't pick up dirt easy. So happy to throw away might old think chunky ones. Great product. Great price. Delivered super fast!\n \n  The small silicon hot pads, suck... They seem thin and will let heat thru from an aluminum cookie sheet of heavens sake!! Crom help you if the small all silicon pads ever get wet... The mits aren't bad but are hot to wear.\n ", "\n  Such a great price for all of them together! The gloves are nice and long so your arms won't accidentally get burned and the squares can also be used as hot pads for pans/cookie sheets. They bend easily and clean easily. They don't scratch my new granite counter. Highly recommend!\n \n  The comfort of cloth meets the functionality of silicone in this perfect oven mitt! BUY THESE!!!!!! Seriously. They are so easy to clean and just feel nice to use! Overall best mitt I have ever owned and I am so SO happy I purchased these.\n \n  These oven mitts work great for me:  my wall oven is fairly high, so the long sleeves protect my wrists and forearms when reaching into hot oven.  I bake a fair amount of no-knead bread, at very high temperatures, and even at 500 degrees, the gloves work just fine, hands and fingers are warm, not hot or burnt, and the glove fingers are flexible.  The potholders are nice extras.  Good choice for bakers.\n \n  These are great. The flexible pads work for all sorts of things, including grabbing a hot pan/sheet. Eventially the heat will go through them if your using them in your hand like that. The mitts are amazing, and the heat never goes through those at all.\n \n  So far so good. Great deal for what you get. I was afraid this material would melt or something when I grabbed the oven rack because I never used it before. So far it has done no such thing. I'm glad I risked trying out a new product that I hadn't before because this seems like it was a great investment at a great deal, and something I'll use and rebuy for a long time. Thanks.\n \n  These potholder are nice and can act as either potholders or trivets.  The silicone oven mitts are quite good at protecting my hands from the heat when moving a cast iron skillet or removing anything from the oven.  These seem to be of high quality and I have had no issues with them.  Most importantly, I haven't been burned due to using them.  My old oven mitt, different story.\n \n  I love these mitts and pot holders. The top part of the mitt is made of silicone and the bottom part is a fabric. Then the inside of the mitt is made of  a fabric that I would like my blankets to be made of, it's so soft and plenty of padding. I used them the very same night they arrived. The potholders are great too. Glad I made this purchase and my make another in the future.\n \n  Love how long the mitts are. They protect your entire hand and forearm. Haven\u2019t had a problem yet. I use these in my cooking and ADL lessons with my special education high school students and they love them as well.\n \n  Awesome oven mitt set. Comes with two mitts and two silicone potholders. You definitely get a bang for your buck with this set. High quality, they look great and very heat resistant. Glad that we purchased them\n \n  Really like the product overall. The grips for the gloves and holders make holding large dishes easy. Have used the holders several times to open jars, which has been really useful. Also, I like the soft material on the inside part of the gloves which is very comfortable.\n ", "\n  Pads are good - they grip the counter, are resistant to sliding around, and provide adequate heat resistance.  But the mitts are very awkward to use.  They are too bulky making it hard to grip items.  I bought Oven Gloves instead.\n \n  No complaints, they shipped and arrived quickly. Nicely packaged, it keeps my wife from burning her hands and as an added bonus, she looks like she has lobster claws when she has em on. Highly recommended!\n \n  Great price and a great product. The only thing I would say is that if you plan on taking a caste iron skillet out of the stove at four hundred degrees, you need to to it in under a minute or you will feel some heat. But two glove and two pads for this price, I would certainly buy it again. I dont think I will need to though, ive had these for months and there is no sign of wear and tear.\n \n  I\u2019ve used them multiple times since buying them and they even stood up to cast iron after broiling steaks in the oven. They got a little warm, but not too bad. Easy to clean!\n \n  I like the gloves but i wished the liner in the glove had been sown inside. Since its loose,it makes it hard to move something heavy with just one hand. I tried to move a cast iron skillet with chicken from inside the oven and it slipped.\n \n  I love these! I didn't think they would work better then my regular mitts but they are better! I can hold onto hot pans longer without feeling the heat. I only wish they had a smaller size for someone with small hands, oven mitts are always so bulky.\n \n  Excellent quality, very easy to clean I actually just throw them in the washing machine. Durable and get the job done at a great price\n \n  These are the best oven mitts! I have small hands and they fit me very well. They also come almost to my elbow which helps to protect my arms. I would give them a 10 if I could!\n \n  Honestly they are thick enough and are comfortable.  I just got them so I don't know how easy they are to clean but I am very pleased with my purchase.\n \n  Better insulation than cloth. I was hesitant to buy silicone for the first time but I really like them.  The cloth ones of slipped in the past, and these don\u2019t\u2026 So I believe they\u2019re safer. A good buy.  Plus they look better\n ", "\n  Looks exactly like in the picture. Since it's silicone it feels nice and the inside of the mitt is soft. The silicone ridges probably help with heat (and slip proof) but that does make it slightly harder to clean.\n \n  Really do a good job keeping me from getting burned!, also seem to \"grab on \" to hot surface and I am confident my meal won't end up on floor, PS my dog hates them!\n \n  These seem like they will last.  I have both other oven mitts and it seems like the heat still comes through but not these.  I like the ones that are square too because they are easy to put in a drawer and then grab it if I need them quickly.  You don\u2019t feel any heat with these ones either.\n \n  I have small hands and they fit me perfectly! Can't feel any heat through them, believe me, I put them to the test! Very sturdy and easy to grip with.\n \n  Can't say if they protect from heat or not.  They are so big and bulky when you try to reach something, the end of the glove pushes it back in the oven.  Too long and too big, not really wearable.\n \n  These are amazing.  No more burning my hands on stuff.  They fit great and the pan pads are excellent.  Got rid of all my old gross mitts because this set is all you need.  Also - super cleanable - got them fairly messy and just rinsed them off with water.  Simply as that...\n \n  These are the most awesome kitchen \"potholders\" i have ever owned! No more oven rack burns! No more cloth holders catching fire on the stove top! Love these!\n \n  The heat penetrates the glove quickly. It makes holding the cookie sheet while transferring the food into a bowl impossible. It insulates just long enough to take the item out of the oven and place it onto the counter.\n \n  These are very protective from high cooking temps. Very easy to clean. Did not know if we would like these, but they are great.\n \n  I have purchased silicone hot pads before but was impressed with the thicken, pliability and quality of the mitt as well as the hot pads.\n ", "\n  good quality I bought this as a gift for my husband who like to cook and grill a lot.  easy to clean and he can grab hot food with the mitten\n \n  Mitts are oversized for easy on/off. Zero heat transfer with hot hot pots. Great grip and safe, easy boiling pot pouring. Best mitts and wish I had \u2018em years ago! Pot holders work well too! I stack my two for real hot pots.\n \n  I seriously don't know why I waited so long to buy, using the old ones that had.byrned through in critical places...\n \n  I love these silicone kitchen musts.  They are a beautiful color, and the heat resistance is just what I need.  I love that they are easy to clean and they don't slip in my hands.\n \n  I really like these oven mitts. I\u2019ve actually received compliments from family about them. My hands and arms survived the holidays from burns thanks to these! We feel barely any heat whatsoever when taking things out of the oven. So happy to have these!\n \n  I bought myself and my daughter a set of these.  Best oven mitts I have ever used and the trivets are great counter savers!  They also come in red if black is not your preference. Very easy to clean as well.\n \n  The mitts are wonderful but pads are not heat resistance. You can feel the heat through the pads. They are good for placing a hot item on but I would recommend using the mitts for handling\n \n  These are just what I was hoping for.  The pot holders are sturdy and easy to use.  The mats are lightweight, and secure on the table--no slipping around. \n  Gave these to my daughter to replace her cloth ones, because she kept burning herself. She said, I feel so professional now!\n \n  Arrived safely, well-packaged, as shown in picture and both mitts and potholders present. Appears to be good quality. Currently stocking for a future apartment, will update once we've actually begun using them in a few months.\n ", "\n  They are a little more rigid than some of the oven mits I have used in the past, as they are made with a high strength/durable silicon... But I have been using them for some time now and they are incredibly good at their job... Keeping me from getting burned!! \n  Got my mitt's today, and used them today Awesome! product I'm very pleased. Definitely, recommend.\n \n  Just received them item last week, and I love it! With my old oven mitts, if I held something for too long I would start to feel the heat from it. With these, the silicone really holds the heat out!\n \n  These work great. Replaced old cloth mitts with these. Can handle much hotter cooking now. Protects my arms when I'm working the grill. Pot holders are excellent too for when you just need to move a hot pot or pan and don't need a full mitt.\n \n  These mitts and mats are perfect! The mitts are very heat resistant and I can use the mats safely on my marble counter top. I highly recommend these products.\n \n  This is a nice set of oven mitts. I have big hands and these fit nicely. The square one are  great for placing under hot pots and are super easy to clean. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.\n \n  We love these! Great color to match all our other kitchen utensils. Durable and should last a long time.\n \n  Not comfortable and overkill for routine kitchen work. I'd rather have the silicone at the finger tips for grip and heat. They are ugly too.\n \n  These are great! They have kept my hands cool. I love having 2 gloves that cover fairly high up my arms. It makes me feel quite safe handling things in the oven. I love how durable they are....no burning holes in the thumbs.\n \n  Don\u2019t have too much to say but it works well and it was a good price. The squares are good pot holders and good for putting hot pots on it. And the mitts work well. No weird smell from the material.\n ", "\n  GREAT set at an unbeatable price!  I can't believe I got all 4 pieces for less than $14.  They are excellent quality too! You would pay the same amount for just the pot holders (and not trivets) in any store.  They are very nice, get the job done, and are easy to clean.\n \n  The oven mitts work well but the square potholders let heat come through. They have a grooved matrix design and the indentation of the grooves are thin so when I used one to pick up the lid on my braising pot I could feel the heat come through, very hot!\n \n  Love these! Great addition to my kitchen. Simple and black and work well!\n \n  These are a pretty nice set. I dont feel any heat coming through when using. I havent tried to clean them yet so not sure how they hold up in that area.\n \n  So the gloves are pretty solid, but the silicone squares do not resist heat very well.\n \n  Great to use and I even used the mat to help me open up a stubborn jar\n \n  Good value and has held up well. Nice temp resistance and very useful\n \n  I have been using these for a few days and great so far! I don't feel the heat with basic use - stovetop and pulling things out the oven with either the mitts or the holders.\n \n  With these mitts I can handle the hottest ovenware with comfort. I can even carry my pizza stone to the counter without risking catastrophe - love these mitts! That said, they are a little large for me, but they never feel like they\u2019re slipping off.\n \n  These seemed great at first but after one use the black silicone rubbed off all over the counters, our hands, the cookware. These are unusable unless you want to wipe down everything they touch including yourself every time you use them.\n ", "\n  I love these mitts. You can put your entire arm in the oven as long as it's covered by the mitts and you will not be burned at all.\n \n  This is a nice set, really sturdy and well made, easy to clean and most of all, no burnt fingers. \n  No more burnt fingers nor dropped trays. The pads work as a trivet too. The mitts cover the forearms and prevent burns. I really like this combo.\n \n  I absolutely  love these! I love them more because since I\u2019m left handed, I need mitts that have protection on both sides. You\u2019d be surprised at the amount of accidents that happen to lefties when using non-lefty tools. Highly recommend!\n \n  Love these. Have not had to clean them yet so I can't speak to that. They are really nice looking. We use them as tactical oven mitts.\n \n  These are fantastic!  Really good value.  Price was great for the four pieces.  I highly recommend.\n \n  Far exceeded my expectations.  I never liked thick mitts.  These are amazingly flexible and comfortable.  Far better than the fabric potholders I've always used.  Can feel the tray or pan but not the heat.  The potholders also work great.  But the mitts have really changed how I feel about opening the hot oven.\n \n  These mittens are awesome.  Unlike cloth type mittens they do NOT get soggy, filthy, they dont burn, and they keep the heat away.\n \n  I have large hands and these mitts fir fine. Very nice set.\n \n  I have needed these for quite awhile! So glad I finally got them!\n ", "\n  I don't burn my hands anymore, \n  Only potholders and oven mitts I've ever used that I didn't get burned through the potholder!\n \n  Bought for my dad he has big hands and loves them. They would be to big for me to use but are perfect for him these are all he will use made well\n \n  These are high quality and set up where it fits lefties and righties.  Love them!\n \n  We were skeptical of the silicone but they\u2019re great! They protect against heat, they are super easy to clean. We love them!\n \n  we like this set. our old ones were getting holes so it was for sure time for new. the plastic seems durable, and they came undamaged. my husband uses them for his BGE and has no issues.\n \n  Amazing! Thin and easy to use. So soft on the inside. I ordered 1 set & liked them so much I threw out all my others & ordered another set. I just wish I could buy extra silicone trivets without the mits.\n \n  our household loves these items! works great\n \n  They are a little bulky I would not re buy these or gift these but in the interim they are ok just really bulky and awkward to use\n \n  I love this product.  They are easy to use and clean.\n ", "\n  I wanted to replace some older oven mitts and was happy with these as a replacement. The silicone seems just as durable as I have previously had.\n \n  Love them! I would by them again & I highly recommend them.\n \n  Silicone outside provides great friction when grabbing things. Soft feel on the inside. Trivets also work great for both grabbing and setting hot items on. About a year in use and no complaints, I think these will last a long time!\n \n  The mits have no insulation so even though the silicone won't melt from the heat, you still get burned. The pot holders still work well as trivets because they are much thicker with a honeycomb pattern..\n \n  I like these a lot I only found one little part of an edge that I felt some heat through. I think this is typical\n \n  Great gift. My sister loves them. No complaints.\n \n  These gloves do their job.  No more burned fingers.  Keep one by the grill and one by the stove.\n \n  Just what the doctor ordered\n \n  Works wonderful and very heat resistant\n \n  These don\u2019t get stained like other hot pads.\n ", "\n  Very effective at heat barrier\n \n  They\u2019re oven mitts, so not much to say, but they do stay cleaner than cloth and protect your hands and/or counters from the heat.\n \n  These are nice quality.  They are thinner than I had expected them to be but that does not affect their performance.  I just pulled a cookie sheet out of a 450\u00b0F oven and felt no heat at all.  My only gripe was that the potholders do not have enough grip to pull a bowl out of a microwave,  but I don't think they were intended to do that so take my assessment for what it is worth.\n \n  They are definitely heat resistant but they are not as easy to use as I had expected. The mitts are adequate the 'pot holders' are better as trivets as they are not as malleable as pot holders should be.\n \n  Great product, exactly what they described.\n \n  My daughter is happy with her gift\n \n  Quality gloves and holders. I don\u2019t think they are huge like some others have said. Would def buy again or as a gift. Work well, clean up a breeze.\n \n  Nice set.  Great value\n \n  nice oven mitts\n \n  Great product!\n ", "\n  Nice looking as well as totally functional. \n  Very nice, very capable product. Does exactly as described and for a good price.\n \n  These are so easy to clean and they stay looking good as well.  I wish I would have gotten a pair a long time ago.\n \n  Exactly as described and comfortable\n \n  Great for cast iron pans.\n \n  Favorite out of the hundreds I have purchased. It\u2019s semi dog proof lol\n \n  Keeps hands protected. great grip (can even use to help open stubborn jars).\n \n  Perfect!\n \n  Seem to be good quality!\n \n  Superb product! I bought two!\n ", "\n  More than expected.\n \n  So far so good just purchased will update\n \n  I love these.  I love that the mitts are a little longer than most.\n \n  Not heat resistant like they said! The heat came right through the mitten!\n \n  I got these for my boyfriend and I love them! They seem huge but when you put them on, they aren't. They are lined on the inside so it's soft and they reach a 450 temp which is awesome!\n \n  Grips pans well and the gloves provide great protection from oven burns.\n \n  Love these!  The size is perfect (one review said it was too big and I have small hands and thought it was perfect), I don't feel the heat and love the feel of the inside. Perfect!\n \n  My husband burned his hand which made my 7 year old cry because he got hurt.  We ordered them to surprise him and they arrived the NEXT DAY.  She was very happy we could chuck the worn mitts he used to have.\n \n  Love how long they are, i can reach all the way in the back of my oven without worrying about burning my forearms\n \n  They are just meh! Nothing amazing but can\u2019t complain\n ", "\n  I have gotten a burn 2x using these. Bought 1 month ago. I\u2019ve dropped the hot food. Really upset and disappointed with these \u201cheat protectant items\u201d . Avoid!!!\n \n  Received oven mitts only.  But no pot holders.  A returned item maybe?  Mitts look good however.\n \n  Bought a set, gave them a strong workout and promptly ordered 2 more sets - one for a gift.  Highly recommend.\n \n  Great mitt set!\n \n  Very flexible and works great\n \n  These look like great quality. I'm giving them to my son and his girlfriend as a Christmas present.\n \n  Bought for family as gifts. They love them as do I since I got one for myself also.\n \n  Works well, good price point for these items.\n \n  I've only had these for a few days but I LOVE everything about them!\n \n  Love! Can't feel any heat and so easy to clean, just wash with the kitchen faucet!\n ", "\n  I found the squared pot holders very clumsy to grasp pots, pans etc.\n \n  I can wash the mitts if stained.  It was a good purchase.\n \n  This is a wonderful purchase for the money.  I like the ease of using the mitts.  I also really like the potholders.  I am happy I made this purchase.\n \n  the hot pads are very difficult to clean\n \n  Mitts are fine but DO NOT use square trivets as potholders!  You will be burned.  I was.  Heat goes right through them.\n \n  Have purchased these gloves countless times. I work on a line where I need grease proof oven gloves. Love these! Highly recommend.\n \n  Good quality. They are a little big for me, but still useful and I've had no problems. For perfectly on my husband.\n \n  Works great. Protects my cute hands from the heat.\n \n  I love these.  I highly recommend them.\n \n  Surprised that I felt heat through these products, happened in under 5 mins of holding a hot pan.\n ", "\n  The mitts are great, but the potholders have a textured surface that captures liquid and makes it difficult to clean and dry.\n \n  These oven mitts are a fantastic quality They are the best oven mitts I have ever owned.\n \n  These are great! Quality oven mitts! Would highly recommend.\n \n  Quality stuff. Quickly received.\n \n  Fit hands well. Easy to grip and lift.  No heat transfer.  The pads are very handy.\n \n  They work great, no complaints, a lil thinner than expected, so need to keep that in mind. But these are so nicer than old fashioned cloth type\n \n  so far no issues\n \n  Great value! Love these! The mits  do a great job of protecting my hands from burns as I take things out of the oven\n \n  Excellent value for the price. I use these when I cook with my cast iron skillet and these shield the heat without issues.\n \n  Just used them today! They are easy to put on and off and worked great. I like that most of the gloves are silicone so easy to wipe off.\n ", "\n  Love these. I have very small hands and they aren\u2019t overly huge or floppy!!! My husband has larger hands and they work for him as well! Super happy with these!\n \n  These mitts are great, very heat resistant and a good price. I like the color too.\n \n  Perfect in our kitchen. Helps to avoid burns. Easy to hold and good grip.\n \n  These are amazing.  Since the lockdown, I've been cooking almost every night.  Absolutely love them!\n \n  I love these. Great product.

Comfortable.\n \n  Great price. Great quality.\n \n  Can handle hot surfaces without a problem\n ", "\n  Great!\n \n  I have extra large hands and I can get them in these and my wife is also happy with the fit, they work great\n \n  These are great! I am extremely sensitive to heat so I have to have think and safe oven mitts like these.\n \n  Look great.  Work great. No complaints\n \n  Bought these as a gift for a friend. She loves them.\n \n  Very good product\n \n  These work great for everything from the oven or grill.\n \n  BEST PRODUCT EVER\n \n  Exactly as doscribed!\n \n  The pot holders are great, but the mitts must be for handling radioactive material(very heavy and bulky)\n ", "\n  These were a gift to my son who is grad school and didn't have oven mitts or potholders.  He was grateful to receive them and pleased with the gift.\n \n  Work very Well\n \n  Work as they should\n \n  Works great and easier to clean than cloth types.\n \n  Theybwork justbturn inside out for wash and dry\n \n  Excellent product  worked exceptionally well , used for my wife\u2019s birthday dinner last night\n \n  great quality.\n \n  Really great quality Love the soft material on the inside.\n \n  Kitchen usage, my sons new apartment. He likes them and they\u2019re heavy duty and seem good quality\n \n  Don\u2019t get hot but are hard to manipulate at times. Also get dirty and not super easy to clean.\n ", "\n  Good quality\n \n  The Oven Mitts do the work and this product is fairly priced as compared to the other products\n \n  I bought these as a gift but I have some and love them.  Great price, too.\n \n  great mits and potholders. Got batter on them washed off and they dry quickly.\n \n  These gloves work great.  Heat resistant and easy to clean.\n \n  Love the quality of these!  They perform as expected.  I can reach my gloved hand into the depths of the 400 degree oven with nary a burn.\n \n  Works great\n \n  This is a great price for the quality.\n \n  Solid product.\n \n  I can still feel some heat coming though the pot holders when I pulled a pan out of a 400 degree oven.\n ", "\n  They're great for a good price.\n \n  These are pretty awesome, and the price is great.\n \n  I\u2019m very happy with the quality and durability of these oven mits.\n \n  Just purchased so far so good we'll come back with a review again in 6 months\n \n  Very durable and great at keeping heat off\n \n  Great product, totally saves me from burning.. these mitts are really a great buy\n \n  Holds up really well.

I have a small hand with petite fingers, so I was delighted these made it easy to grip my pans coming out of the oven. They have a little more of a sleeve going up the arm which helps to protect arms as well. These did protect my hands from getting hot. Nicely insulated. Easy to clean - scrub with soap and water or a quick soak and rinse. \n  I love this set!  I had added it to my Amazon wish list, and I got this as a Christmas gift.  What a great bargain!  The mitts and the pads are top notch quality.  I used them several times the day I received them (holiday cooking), and they were perfect.  The two pads side-by-side were perfect for a hot pan placed directly on the countertop straight out of the oven.\n \n  I got this for my boyfriend as a Valentine\u2019s gift. He has been wanting new potholders but he never got around buying any. So I looked on Amazon and these caught my attention. I was worried too because many commented that the mitts/ gloves were large. These came in today and they fit perfectly. It was not tight but definitely not too loose for my boyfriend\u2019s hands either. They also just look nicer than ones you can get at Target or elsewhere. More protection from heat. Win.\n \n  The inside of the gloves are extremely soft, and the arms are nice and long, so I don't have to worry about burning my forearms. At 450 degree oven temp, these gloves worked great with no burnt fingers, like my old gloves did. I had no trouble gripping the pans and glass dish I used. I'm sure the pads will work just as well when the time comes to use them.\n \n  The mitts work very well and are worth the comparable price to ones from other retailers...the hotpads however should only be used as trivets, not to get pans out of the oven. The silicone separates and allows the hot metal pan to touch your skin.\n \n  These oven products arrived very quickly.  They were a gift for a bride to be and she was very pleased with them.\n \n  Very thick material.  I used these to get the ham out the oven yesterday and no heat bled through.  They are flexible enough that I can maneuver around my pots and pans.\n ", "\n  At this point, have only had for less than a week, and only used once. \n  Love the big mitts but be careful using the hot pads they don't protect well for hot pans and I almost burnt myself.\n \n  made nicely. Heavy duty. better than expected.\n \n  I gave these to my son for Christmas. He loved them. High quality products!\n \n  Love these, work really well\n \n  My daughter loved the gift. I appreciated the quick delivery before Christmas.\n \n  Very nice addition\n "]}}
