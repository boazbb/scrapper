It seemed cloudy out the box but just needed to be washed.\n \n  Both all sides and bottom of the vase is thickened design, compared with ordinary vase more thick and strong, with high quality lead-free crystal glass looks like a gentleman, elegant and stable. Large size. Crystal glass production, the vase is more glaring than general vase, particularly in reflecting light, the vase will be very bright.  Not only for home decoration, restaurant decoration, flower shop decoration, office decoration, sharp corners, bubbles and wrinkles on the glass, safe and beautiful. Worth to buy.\n \n  Very beautiful!\n \n  I have to admit that I prefer the classic styles to the more modern. This vase is beautiful and at this price it can't be beat. It's perfect for what I was looking ... not too tall it makes a real statement on the dining room table. It's so stylish, beautiful and catches so much light. It's a show piece for sure. I am so glad I bought it.\n \n  I didn\u2019t realize how small 8 inches was. It\u2019s very sturdy.\n \n  Good quality for the price. Sits very pretty on my counter!\n \n  Nice crystal cut vase. This is a wonderful size. Big enough for a small bouquet of flowers. Thick sides make it sturdy. Beautiful design is lovely.\n \n  I was throwing away dead flowers from my previous flower vase and the vase slipped out of my hand and shattered all over my floor so I was now in the market for a new one, and the design of this one caught my eye and made me keep going back to it after looking at others so I went ahead and bought it. I'm very pleased with the look of this vase and believe it will serve it's purpose for years to come. My husband brings flowers quite often so it will get lots of use at my house. I would purchase this particular vase again in the future. I had no problem fitting the last bouquet he brought in it, and had room to spare so size is definitely ideal.\n \n  Received item on time smooth and good shape, yes its worth of penny i can say of my own,  Thick crystal glass and good looking  vase. I love it now i can buy a new flowers to put on my vase\n \n  The vase is nice and as expected.  The box containing the vase was quite beat up despite being packed adequately.  It looks old and weathered so seems to be more from either being returned or not handled well during packing.  Looks like the vase has been opened and taken in and out of the box several times.  The edges of the box are worn and it overall looks old.  Wouldn't be a big deal if I purchased for myself but this is intended as a gift and the original box makes it looks like a \"regifting\" situation which is undesired.  As a result, I've had to buy a nicer gift box and shredded paper filling to make it look presentable to give someone.  I would return and ask for one with a better box but I don't have the time to do so before needed.\n ", "\n  very durable heavy weighed vase.  Greta value for the money. will buy again\n \n  this product did not meet the description stated on the website either that or I didn't get the so color box. right now I have a $2.00 dollar flower vase that is dull and definitely does not shoot rays of light around the room. i would not recommend this product\n \n  I mean for the price you can\u2019t go wrong. I give it 5 stars because it\u2019s exactly as described however it\u2019s not too durable. It\u2019s not that thick. It\u2019s not that big or heavy. It worked out well for the bed room but for a heavier traffic area I see this thing falling and breaking into pieces. Good for the price but if your looking for a heavy durable one look elsewhere. If you want an inexpensive decent vase, well this is it\n \n  I only gave 3 stars because it's small not big enough for a whole dozen roses. We are stuck in the house & there isn't enough time for me to order another mother's day gift so I am stuck with this & not happy bout it! What I do like it's pretty and sturdy considering it was shipped on no special packaging & left on my porch so the fact that it wasn't broken still amazes me.\n \n  This vase is kind of heavy, but that adds to the beauty and sturdiness. It's smooth and feels like waves of water swirling around my hand. I haven't gotten flowers yet. But I can't wait to set this up.\n \n  this vase is good for light or medium size bouquet .  If you ave Bouquet  with 25-50 roses, or lilies or long Calla lilies  - this vase would be too small.\n \n  It is neither very big nor too small. Thick and strong. The size is perfect for tea table. I loved it.\n \n  This is a good quality flower vase with a medium size which I expect to be a bit bigger as well its expensive for the price. In the other way around I used it in my living room and just like a perfect fit with the tulip flower that I've ordered. But as I have said, I only give 3 stars as it's too expensive for the price of the item.\n \n  I feel in love with this vase on line and even more so after receiving it. It is much prettier than pictured. Very elegant, beautifully crafted, very sturdy. It is definitely worth the money.\n \n  The vase is a nice design but much smaller than anticipated and the glass itself arrived greasy. No bubble wrap around it either. Wouldn\u2019t recommend, unless you have a very small bouquet and not using as a centerpiece.\n ", "\n  I bought both the 8\u201d and 12\u201d sizes and I am thrilled with them both. Particularly at this price point. They both look just like their pricier \u201ccrystal\u201d competitors. A great buy and bargain!\n \n  I bought the large vase in hopes that it would be larger than the vases we already own.  The claimed opening of 5\" measures only 4-1/8\" at best, and the inside tapers down to 2-1/4\" diameter about 4\" below the rim.  This makes this vase much smaller in terms of usable capacity than I expected.  It's a nice looking and sturdy vase, if you don't mind only having a small bouquet in it.  It's not worth the hassle to return it, but the stated size was misleading for sure.\n \n  Filled with beautiful flowers for my sons girlfriend. I liked the heaviness,overall look of the vase. Very pleased!!  She was also happy with the gift!\n \n  I was not happy with the crystal, it was a bit cloudy looking. The size was lovely and so is the design I just didn't care for the quality of glass.\n \n  It\u2019s heavier then I expected. It\u2019s really pretty will definitely get more of these. I brought it for myself for Mother\u2019s Day\n \n  Llego quebrado\n None \n  I hate the fact that is very small\n \n  It was a gift for a friend-She Loves It!  She has fresh flowers every day!  She put away her other vases and only use this one!\n \n  Love the vase. Better in person than the picture.\n \n  This is the worst product that I have ever purchased on Amazon. It arrived in a box that was not sealed and had clearly been opened. The product itself looked cloudy, dirty, and undoubtably used. The images are very misleading as the vase itself is very small. Please save yourself the $13. I returned it and was refunded but I am still in shock that a product that with relatively good reviews was so terrible.\n ", "\n  Love it! This is a very beautiful thick glass vase. It is heavy and steady. My curious cat loves to study all new bouquets of flowers and I hope that this vase will not fall as easily as the previous ones.\n \n  This is a fairly nice class Bass. The vase seems to be well made and is quite sturdy. I would recommend the surveys to others.\n \n  This is a great flower vase for a center piece on the table.  It is thick and sturdy and does not tip easily.  Very nice.\n \n  Was very disappointed in the height of the vase.  At least an inch shorter than what it shows.  It is very thick and sturdy and the price is very reasonable.\n \n  Way too small. Obvious it wasnt the correct size when I got the box. Not even big enough To be considered a fancy drinking glass\n \n  Are you sure I did not review this before? I absolutely love it, perfect size, perfect weight, looks gorgeous in my bedroom!\n \n  Lovely vase!\n \n  You get what you pay for. I bought these for just on the bookcase but it was cloudy, not clear.\n \n  Looks very nice, made the perfect gift.\n \n  I gave to my friend in Reno. Every time I visit him he always has fresh flowers for me\n ", "\n  The vase itself is fine, but had to rebox as it was a gift and the box looked like it had been run over before being packed.\n \n  Bought as a Christmas gift for a friend.i had bought this vase for my relative as a Christmas gift. She liked the vase.\n \n  Loved the quality of the glass, very pleased. I wish I got the larger size. The 8\u201d does not fit a full bouquet from Publix. Lol very pretty for maybe a few Unique bouquet of flowers.\n \n  Great value for the price. If you are looking for an inexpensive vase, that looks great, I highly recommend this item.\n \n  This product is falsely advertised both the size and the supposed larger size are miniature vases I wouldn\u2019t even hold any flowers falsely advertised don\u2019t waste your money!!!\n \n  Just as expected very happy a sturdy vase with beautiful lines!\n \n  Beautiful and stable heavy glass vase.\n \n  Beautiful vase. Thick lovely scalped glass\n \n  Very pretty\n \n  Beautiful!!! I love to spruce my home with fresh flowers and colored water beads. this is a great addition to any flowers\n ", "\n  mom loved it , my son and I put 2 bouquets of flowers in this vase. Not only did they all fit but weight of the vase was perfectly balanced for that many flowers.\n \n  Very disappointed in size of this vase.\n \n  Very pretty.  Feels and looks expensive\n \n  Nice vase for the price\n \n  I love the vase but it was dusty and have a familiar smell to it, it almost smelt similar to vinegar or the way it does when it has been used before. Wasn't very happy about that but I washed and soaked it to get that beautiful look of newness that it should have had.\n \n  This vase was much smaller than pictured online. Bought as a gift and I am a little embarrassed to give this vase to the person.\n \n  Upon opening this vase today to show my husband before the wedding, he noticed a flaw crack, and we don't feel we can gift it:(\n \n  Needed a vase for my mother day flowers, This is a perfect pick.\n \n  Really nice vase very thick\n \n  I brought this vase and it looked great, however, they did not do a good job with packaging. The vase was broken into small pieces in the box.\n ", "\n  This was a perfect Vase for holding the bouque after the wedding ceremony.\n \n  I really liked the thickness and strength of the glass! Quality is excellent and looks very ornate.\n \n  I received it but too small ,I am going to return it for a bigger size .\n \n  Love it\n \n  Nice for the price\n \n  It's actually less than 8 inch tall vase. \n  I love this vase! Exactly what I was looking for. It\u2019s beautiful!\n \n  I am very happy with this cut glass vase. It is heavy for not being able to turn over & spilling! \n  Smaller than what I thought it\u2019d be, but it worked out great.\n \n  Sturdy as it arrived in a large box just rolling around. Super small- should\u2019ve looked at the size better. Nothing fancier than one you\u2019d find at a dollar store \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n ", "\n  Beautiful and sturdy, I love it.\n \n  Beautiful vase, will give it as a gift, out of the box with some flowers in it.\n \n  Beautiful vase to decorate my room!\n \n  We liked it. Though it says large, but not so large at all. It is just fine. Its pretty heavy though as it should be.\n \n  It is nice and heavy, however mine showed up and has a white spot inside the glass that is visible from several feet away. It works on a utilitarian level but if you\u2019re looking for something to showcase, you may want to look elsewhere.\n \n  Just as promised - a lovely, decorative vase for the etargere.\n \n  Like the vase, would buy again - in fact, this the second one; I dropped the other one!\n \n  This vase has good weight to it and is very sturdy.  I like the thicker glass.  My cut flowers look beautiful in this vase...my new favorite\n \n  Great for small desk to have fresh flowers!\n \n  I love this vase! It\u2019s so elegant looking!

It is the correct size for a fromal table or for any informal setting.\n \n  It's nice\n \n  This item had a nice solid weight to it. Very nice design and not something you'd have to replace as long as you don't drop it on the ground.\n \n  Way too small\n \n  This was not the vase I ordered. I received one that looked like the one I choose, but it was disappointing when I opened the box. It was much plainer than the picture.\n \n  Very sturdy.  Cut glass is very shiny.\n \n  Too small\n \n  Loved tht it came as promised\n \n  Delivered filty. Appeared to have been used\n ", "\n  Product is not the right size and came all filthy. \n  This vase is really 7.5''  x 3.5\", it's good for a small bouquet or a wide mouth bud vase.\n \n  very pretty vase with thick glass, perfect as i expected.\n \n  Decorating\n \n  Such an elgant and beautiful vase! I really love this. It\u2019s very sturdy and heavy. Highly recommended!\n \n  LOOKED LIKE IT WAS BOUGHT AT A DOLLAR STORE.  THREW IT AWAY.\n \n  Arrived in a good condition and I love it!!\n \n  Smart looking\n \n  I bought this to give as a wedding gift.\n \n  Totally loved it. Very strong and nice\n ", "\n  Absolutely love it\n \n  Very Pretty Vase, came in perfect condition.\n \n  I measured it to see that it's no taller than 9 1/8\"\n \n  Love it\n \n  It\u2019s so sturdy and so strong. But I think it\u2019s costlier.\n \n  I love the item but it arrived broken\n \n  I love it\n \n  It la true to size\n \n  Great vase! Does the job!\n \n  Very good\n ", "\n  vases are nice, but more narrow than I thought\n \n  small\n \n  The product was broken in many pieces.\n \n  Product arrived broken, had to drive to the store and purchase another vase because needed it for an event :(\n \n  Very poor quality \n  I'm so disappointed. The vase came shattered in pieces.\n \n  Terrible quality.\n \n  Wayyyyyy small.  Did not know it would be that small, tried to judge it by the measurements but I don't think they are right.  More of a single-rose holder or a few pens and pencils.\n \n  I ordered the large size because I needed a vase 11\u201d-12\u201d.  I got the 8\u201d one. I\u2019ll keep it because I like it, but now I have to buy another vase.  Also, the box that it comes in was put in a box way too big with no padding. It just slid around. It\u2019s amazing it wasn\u2019t broken because the small box it came in had opened and the vase was only partly in it. But like I said. I do like the vase.\n \n  Great size and shape for elegant table centerpieces. Not to tall to be in the way\n ", "\n  Looks elegant without competing with flowers for attention. Love that it's less likely to be overturned due to its wider base.\n \n  Exactly as described. I have a real problem when people write reviews for something harping that \u201cit\u2019s too small!\u201d when the dimensions are clearly advertised. You were a lazy buyer and didn\u2019t measure! With that said, the vase is a medium sized vase to go on a table or something. Not super small but NOT the kind you want to place on the floor. I have some cotton stems in mine which have a bunch of blooms up and down the stems and it holds 6 of them nicely. \n  Very beautiful  vase.  It is not too big so when I buy flowers at the grocery store it works nicely.  Great purchase!\n \n  Do you ever feel the need for a little sunshine in your day? Do you grab a colorful bouquet at the market and then have to dig around for something to put the flowers in? This lovely little vase is so pretty and is the perfect size and shape for those little bundles of joy. No more cheap dollar store vases for me!\n \n  I buy Flowers every week for my Wife she Loves them it makes her Happy when She is Happy I\u2019am Happy\n \n  This is a nice size, well made, thick glass vase perfect for flowers.  Looks great anywhere you put it.  Eye catcher looks!\n \n  This vase is definitely an eye catch and quite a value for the money.  The etched detail and weight are wonderful and enhances the artificial flowers I placed in it.\n \n  Pretty, sturdy , and great quality for the money. I just needed container that was shorter for my roses that I picked off my roses in my patio. I just had the tall or wide containers. This was perfect 8 inches tall\n \n  These are ok-the glass was not really clear but perhaps I need to put them through the dishwasher.  They also were not nearly as big and heavy as I had wanted, but they will serve a purpose\n \n  This vase surpassed my expectations. I think it is crystal, as it is very thick. Great quality, very impressive. Nice large size also.\n ", "\n  Its beautiful and I've been using it since I bought it its strong and easy to clean well worth the money and fairly cheap for the quality\n \n  The top fans out to prevent the flowers from being bunched up. I put latex flowers in mine. Excellent quality vase.\n \n  Looks more expensive than your cost.. Perfect size for many uses.. I have now bought three of these lovely vases...\n \n  Balanced attractive vase in nice gift box !! Nice looking with plenty of room for flowers ! Gave 2 to mom & she loves them ! Have 1 for my dining room & ordered another for my room.  Don't hesitate to purchase as very nice !\n \n  Awesome vase used it for a gift for my wife with roses but I had to cut down the roses to size since the vase is 8inchs while the roses are more than 15inchs but she loves it, so yes the vase is small\n \n  They are very pretty, but I can't find silk flowers to fit them...The are really small. But I will hold on to them..I am not giving up.\n \n  Happy with my purchase!  Good quality....came in perfect condition and on time!\n \n  It's very pretty and sturdy. All you  hope is that no body figures out that is is cheap as chips. And, no bubbles in the glass!\n \n  It is what it is. A glass vase. It looks bigger in the photo but hey, it happens to the best of us. A dollar bill is 6 inches long. The vase is 7.5 inches long. Still, its undamaged.\n \n  This is a nice thick beautiful vase.  Great item for the amount of money spent.  I truly love it.  Thanks.\n ", "\n  I bought this and then I bought a dozen small roses not the big one, small African roses, they cannot fit, they squeezed in the vase, this vase only good for put one roses in, and not tall, so you need to cut rose short to fit.\n \n  This vase is the perfect size for my needs. I got it for the small island in my kitchen. It holds a medium sized bouquet very nicely, and I love the design, with thick crystal and fluted top edges. Good quality, great buy.\n \n  Sturdier and thicker made than I expected considering the size and price. Good quality.\n \n  Looks good. Heavy duty. Bought for office and one for home. It looks great.\n \n  This vase was ok, just a little small for me and I didn't see the shine in it like I was hoping to see.\n \n  It didn't look like a nice crystal vase.  Its quality looks like a cheap Dollar Store vase like glass,  poor quality etching. I was not impressed.  It was a gift for my daughter and I don't think she cared much for it either.\n \n  This is a great looking vase and should last a long time because of how thick the glass is. I would buy it again.\n \n  I got item to replace another I broke that was my mothers!\n \n  This is so bright\n \n  Thick and heavy\n ", "\n  great\n \n  Very small in size\n \n  very small\n \n  so delighted\n \n  Beautiful, heavy and thick!

Now it\u2019s the center piece of my dining room table!\n \n  Looks great with my fake flowers- really is the finishing touch!\n \n  it was ok. .\n \n  Very nice and quality is great!\n \n  Looked cheap. The box was low quality. Didn\u2019t feel like I could give it as a gift, as intended. Returned it.\n \n  Good item\n ", "\n  At first I was not sure about these.  I ordered 3 of them and when I opened one it looked kind of oily.  I washed them and decided they are a good deal after all.\n \n  Purchased for my friend/neighbor and she was happy.\n \n  Very nice smaller base. Good for 12 roses bouquet.\n \n  Great gift item at a reasonable price.  Good quality w/o breaking the bank!\n \n  A lot smaller then I was expecting and not as nice looking as I expected.\n \n  This is small vase! I like the design! Simple but nice!crystal clear glass!\n \n  Sturdy. Looks pretty.\n \n  This was a wedding gift.\n \n  Beautiful nice gift !!\n \n  What a surprise!  Was an impulse buy when ordering other items.

I thought for the price it would be a cheap vase but it is just the opposite! It's thick and heavy and the walls of the vase are thick as well. It won't fall over with the weight of the flowers! I'm very pleased.\n \n  I bought this to replace my darker, fatter vase. I ended up deciding to keep both. This vase looks delicate and elegant, and because it\u2019s clear glass and there are so many options as far as what to fill it up with, it would look good pretty much anywhere regardless of your color palette. It would probably look very cute with a string of waterproof fairly lights suspended inside.\n \n  Product arrived in perfect condition. I could not be more happy that was only thing that made me nervous about ordering this on here. But i couldnt find a vase like this anywhere around town. I needed specifics... tall enough and skinny enough to fit on my shelf and it did ! Im so glad shipping did okay and no marks or scuffs in the glass from manufacturing. This vase is thick also, so it wont shatter or break easy it will also stand up even if you put some heavy flowers in it, I wanted something that wouldn't tip easy either, and this is it. Cant wait to decorate inside it. For reference I got the 16inch high 3inch wide and she fit just perfect on my 3.5 inch wide gallery shelf. \n  I'm a floral & event designer in Lawrenceville GA and I needed additional vases for a large wedding.  The vases were packed very well.  Non were broken.  Good quality glass with very little to no imperfection in the glass.  My only problem is that they are not 14 inches tall.  They are about 13.5 inches tall.  I will keep them and make them work.\n \n  I used these for my wedding center pieces in 3 different sizes.  They looked beautiful!\n \n  I got the vase a week age and as I was putting the flowers into it, I noticed a small cut on the glass. I was afraid that in the future it might crack and break. I contacted Amazon, which sent me a replacement and return label for the first one. I had the new one yesterday. It is perfect. I love the vase and CS. Thanks!\n \n  I mean...it's a vase from Amazon. It holds my flowers and looks very nice. There are no cracks in mine. The material is lightweight and not the best quality but it looks very nice. I had tall flowers and needed a tall vase so I have no issues with this product. I like it. Do not drop it on a hard surface though. That will not end well.\n \n  I ordered a 12 pack of these vases.  They were well packaged and arrived undamaged.  These are what I consider light duty vases.  They are not very heavy glass.  The bottoms are relatively thin compared to other vases I own.  If you don't put at least a quart of water in the vase to add weight there is a risk of the vase tipping over with top heavy flowers.  The quality is very inconsistent.  The thickness of the glass varies from 3.5mm to 6.5 mm in the case of 12.  In addition, there are multiple flaws in the glass.  One vase is chipped.  It appears that it was shipped that way from the factory.  See attached photos.\n \n  Posted a review several days ago thinking this was Acrylic but indeed is glass.  Had a purplish haze to it and felt light in weight to the black ones I had also purchased.  I ordered another one from a different vender was arrived and was definitely glass.  Rechecked this one and is glass.  The cut edge made it appear to be something other than glass...kind of like wine bottles cut down.  Anyway, keeping them all anyway. Quite beautiful!  Use Clear Museum Gel \u201cQuakeHOLD\u201d available on Amazon to adhere without damage to furniture and glass.  Works like a charm!  Enjoy!!\n \n  Exactly what I needed for my dried eucalyptus. I probably could have ordered a size down from 16\u201dH but too lazy to exchange :) I will be ordering more in different sized for other use.\n ", "\n  I purchased this item as a replacement in a candle holder that could  accommodate up to a 3\u201d cylinder or vase.  I was excited to find this one advertised as 3\u201d x 3\u201d.  But it is slightly large than a 3\u201d external diameter, 3 1/8\u201d actually, so it did not fit my application. The internal diameter is 2 7/8\u201d.  It does measure the same at the bottom and the top, so it truly is straight up and down. Also, the vase is a heavy weight glass, 1/8\u201d thick.  There was a bubble in the glass and the interior bottom was uneven, but nothing that impacted its functionality.  Overall a good value for the money, but too large for my candleholder.\n \n  I purchased this vase to use as a decoration for my wedding and am very disappointed.  It arrived with SEVERAL imperfections in the glass, dings, scratches, etc. not to mention extremely dusty/dirty.  The glass was cut unevenly as well so the lip on the top is wider on one side than the other.  It also is not very sturdy and wobbles a bit when you put it on a flat surface.  Needless to say...I will NOT be using this for my wedding.\n \n  This is great value for the money. But not as advertised. It states it's 14x4. But I already had 2 of this size from another company and this one came up short. I measured its not 14 inch tall its 13.5. So now im going to have to buy either shorter or go back to another company. Buyer beware on size difference\n \n  The glass is high quality and fairly thick. It looks great and the size options are exactly what I needed.\n \n  The appearance is nice. The quality is good & it arrived quickly!  What disappointed me is a typical floating candle that fits a 3 inch vase will not fit into this vase. Inside Width is less than 3:15.\n \n  ordered 2 vases at same time \n  Good quality vase, but 3\u201d candles do NOT fit inside them like they do in other 3\u201d vases.\n \n  these are just what was needed for centerpieces, we had only one totally broken in the box. contacted the vendor and they wanted a picture of the broken vase...was afraid to open since it sounded like it was in a million pieces. Offered to mail it back as is but they declined the offer...now out 1 vase.\n \n  Exactly as described, really nice glass. Fits a decorative plant leaf/long candle. Good value.\n \n  It\u2019s pretty stable for being tall. I keep my lit Burch branches in the corner in it. Perfect size. I worried about shipping but it came in one piece via prime 2 day!! Very satisfied for the price.\n ", "\n  Perfect size vase for what I wanted to use it for. I ended up placing it next to my foyer table which i think went well. Its not too heavy and just the tight hight.\n \n  Arrived completely in tact. Some small imperfections in glass, but nothing that couldn't be hidden by having that be the back side\n \n  The glass vase was packaged really well and the box was labeled fragile, handle with care, nice vase for the price.\n \n  The 20\" tall, slender 4\" glass vase arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The walls were just thick enough to give sturdiness and perfect weight and balance. Very well made.  Stacked up all 7 of our various baseballs and it looks dynamic.\n \n  I could get over the fact that the glass looks cheap...like cloudy or not completely smooth.  But the bottom isn't flat and so it sort of rocks.  No excuse for that no matter what the price.\n \n  There are flaws in the glass and if I was going to gift it, I would return it.  But I am using personally and by the time you get some colored water in the vase or some glass marbles, you won't notice them much.  The glass is thick and well made.\n \n  i got this to display this flower for my wife. it has one tiny imperfection as you can see its shadow. the glass is not the same thickness all the way around. these things do not matter to me, it serves its purpose. when the kids knock it over and break it, i will buy another.\n \n  Love these cylinder vases.  I've ordered three and will order more for my mother's 60th birthday.  The spray paint set very well and easy to peel off.  I am very happy with this product.  It's sturdy and very tall as I imagined.\n \n  I ordered 2 cases for my wedding to line the aisle with floating candles, and like another reviewer, these were the best priced for the size and quality. There were no cracked vases, but a couple had some very slight flaws (little bubbles in the glass). However, nothing that you would notice unless you were closely inspecting them.  I soaked the bottoms in an inch of water with a little dish detergent and some Goof Off for a few minutes and the stickers on the bottoms came right off.  They'll also need a swipe of Windex, as they were a little dusty upon arrival.  Would definitely recommend.\n \n  I loved so much that I ordered one more\n ", "\n  I finally found a vase tall enough for my sunflowers. \n  As I expected. Well packaged.\n \n  I was looking for glasses that couldn\u2019t break as easily as glass but looked nice. These actually look like glass, they are very sturdy and so pretty. Definitely recommend!\n \n  I bought this about three weeks ago for $10,  it feel and cracked, I wanted to buy another one, now it's $17. \n  Perfect size for small bouquets\n \n  I was nervous about ordering glassware for my wedding reception online, I wasn't sure what the quality would be like. The vases are much thicker and sturdier than I anticipated and I'm very pleased. They do have some minor bubbles and a couple have some very light scratches but nothing that really detracts from how great they look. I was worried they might not be heavy enough and would be a topple over risk but they are definitely not!\n \n  These are very cheap vases with both of mine being cut at the top at bad angles. They are not flat across the top. The thickness of the glass is off in places, there was residue on the glass on the inside I could not get off. Spend more and get something quality, unless you only plan to use these one time.\n \n  So far this glass vases are the best I had ever purchased. They came on time and very protected. Every vase comes in a box and it's wrapped with tissue paper inside the box , they are very clean and best quality I have ever seen on vases. The centerpieces look adorable!\n \n  Packaging was PERFECTION. I can understand why the shipping charge was a little high, however I would not have it any other way. You pay for quality and the packaging was beyond my expectation. And of course the cylinder glass was perfect as well. This is for my wedding and I cannot wait to use them as my center pieces.\n \n  Simple, pretty cylinder vase that I was looking for. Really like the height. Good product to add a little decor to your home. Exactly what I was wanted.\n ", "\n  Arrived in one piece. Looked beautiful for my daughters sweet 16 party as the main centerpieces. Strong. Durable. Pretty.\n \n  Perfect for my bamboo plant\n \n  The vase was fine....I just failed to order the correct opening size.  I meant to order 4\" this was 3\" which was too small.  I wanted to return it and get the one, I actually needed, but, I was surprised that I was going to have to pay just as much for return shipping as I did for the vase, so, I just kept it.  This is the first time, I've had this issue.\n \n  This is my 2nd vase from this company. My other one I've had many years. It holds my bamboo. I got the 20in. and my amaryllis is going to be so happy.\n \n  Really Cheap and not to good too full of bubbles inside is probably a made cheap in china ! Buy the same  at any store and save money because the return cost the vase \n  The vases are beautiful. They are thick which makes them more sturdy. Important to note that they are 1/2\" shorter than advertised, actual size is 17 1/2\" from outside base to rim, 17\" from interior base to rim. Doesn't make a huge difference in how we are using them, but worth it to note depending on how you are using them. All of them arrived perfectly in tact, great packaging!\n \n  So happy with these glass cylinders for my wedding. This exact size is actually very hard to find. The packaging was great so there was absolutely no damage to the vases. Comes with a cloth to clean the vases. I would recommend.\n \n  This is just the right size for my wedding pieces and to be able to get the product in bulk for a $100 or so, is not bad at all. Other companies are charging triple that!\n \n  This was perfect! It came well packaged, perfect size, texture height. Will definitely order from here again. Very pleased.\n \n  It is exactly what I expected. It is thick and sturdy and just the right size.\n ", "\n  It is nice and solid. Looking forward to lighting candles in it.\n \n  This is a great product. It gets the job done. Thank you!\n \n  These glass vases were beautiful!  I used them as hurricanes and filled them with candles for a fireplace display and it turned out great!  The vases were high quality, well priced and arrived 3 days from purchase.\n \n  I bought this to make smoothies with my little hand blender. It\u2019s great for that and would make a lovely vase.\n \n  I was a little skeptical at first but the vases held up\n \n  Product was broken into SEVERAL pieces. There was two small pieces of bubble wrap around it, not enough to cover the vase. Very unhappy!!\n \n  Beautiful. It will definitely add detail to any flower arrangement.\n \n  Good quality product. Shipped well to protect the glass.\n \n  Just want I needed for my projects.  They are good quality. Thick enough not to break and tall enough for the elegant touch.\n \n  Looked great, simple to set up with wedding decorations. Will use for a long time. Super sturdy\n ", "\n  I thought these were so much bigger but the aren\u2019t . I really have no use for them now because I bought the correct ones now.\n \n  Bought these for my nieces sweet 16 for center piece decorations. They are the cheapest I found and the quality was great..\n \n  We got these for my daughter\u2019s wedding reception.  Not of the vases looked the same.  Some were a very thick glass and some were thin.  Also, some of them were noticeably thicker on one side than the other.  The glass was so thick on some i am not sure you could fit a 2 1/2 I can candle inside.  Also a few has what appeared to be chips in them but were actually flawed glass.\n \n  Fragile like a teenagers emotions....\n \n  I was super nervous about ordering these because there weren\u2019t a lot of reviews and it just seemed to good of a deal. But they are great! They all came in tact not broken thank god! It\u2019s always a risk ordering online but these are perfect exactly what I was looking for at a great price!\n \n  Looking at it alone,it looks like a big glass of water.When you put the beautiful flowers on it,they are really perfect together.They make my home warmer.\n \n  Exactly what I was looking for to use on dinner tables at our son's wedding reception.  They are sturdy and the shipping box and wrapping was exceptional.\n \n  It was delivered quickly and well packed. The vase had a couple of minor defects but that won\u2019t effect what I\u2019m using it for.\n \n  These vases are of low quality, but make sense for a baby shower or public event. Some of these vases were broken and when I contacted the seller about this, nothing was done to replace them.\n \n  Very nice vase. Packaged well and I was pleased that it arrived undamaged.\n ", "\n  Ordered a pack of 6, every single vase has issues. Dollar store has a better quality. So not worth the money. Also, I selected the cheapest shipment option, and they charged me $15.\n \n  Perfect for my wedding centerpieces, great price as I shopped around before getting these ones.\n \n  Excellent\n \n  Nice thick glass. Not too many imperfections. Packaged nicely. Would buy again.\n \n  Got these for my wedding, the glass is thick and they were the perfect height for my centerpieces.\n \n  Nice size. Meet expectation\n \n  Expensive vase, I found one at Target for $2.99\n \n  Great for decorative stems with glass pebbles or tall flowers\n \n  Not what I expected.\n \n  Measurements were NOT accurate\n ", "\n  The glass was uneven at the bottom, but it works fine for what I needed it for.\n \n  Looked amazing very impressive because none were broken when arrived and each one was consistent and all looked the same.\n \n  Ok\n \n  This vase was exactly what I was looking for, I love it!!\n \n  It appears large in the picture but it's small.\n \n  It\u2019s perfect.

Packaged well.\n \n  These were good quality glass, none were broken and they were the perfect height to hold branches for centerpieces!\n \n  Had a crack flaw in the center of it.\n \n  I ordered 36 of these vases not even one came broken. I\u2019m so happy with my purchase I totally recommend\n \n  I used these to make centerpieces for my sister's baby shower and they were great. All arrived undamaged, and I filled them with pink and clear water beads and submersible LED lights and topped it with a pink silk flower arrangement I made. Very good buy.\n \n  Multi use and great for holiday decor\n \n  Great value for money\n \n  Perfect!!!\n ", "\n  They are so elegant, and they were perfect for my little sister\u2019s wedding.\n \n  Both broke the a minor tap. Tall vases need to be taller I had order two more. Simple cylinder is a good design for curly bamboo. Also tip easy but the price is great\n \n  Very pretty! Used for decoration at a wedding reception. Well worth the price.\n \n  Narrow but the floating candle fit in it just fine\n \n  Exactly as described.

Handle Carefully.\n \n  Very good deal for the price and quantity! None came cracked or broken. I think it personally  depends on handling of your ups or delivery man.\n \n  Bought these for my daughters wedding in December......to be used as centerpiece sin the reception hall. They were packed extremely well and arrived earlier than expected! Nice, solid vases.......well worth the price! I would highly recommend these! I am very pleased with them!\n \n  The glass has bubbles and is very thin. At least this one didn't arrive broken, so that's a plus.\n \n  Upset with how small and dirty it was once I received. I will be returning\n \n  Bought this to hold all the sand Ive collected from all my vacations over the years. It looks GREAT! The glass has some thickness to it so I don't worry about it easily breaking. It looks amazing!\n ", "\n  Vases arrived individually boxed (within a larger packing box). None were damaged. Able to use all vases - NO major imperfections requiring any return. Some variation in the thickness of the glass - but not problematic at all. Worked perfectly with 3\" floating candles. Incredible value. Highly recommend.\n \n  Items were packaged very well, none were broken. They arrived exactly during the estimated time as Amazon had stated. I would have given 5 stars but the thickness of the vases was not consistent... 1 could be 1/8\" thick & another 1/4\" thick. With that being said... they are still useable and really not that noticeable, well worth the price.\n \n  I am using these for center pieces for my daughter's wedding. They were exactly what I wanted and at a great price as well!\n \n  Like\n \n  We have now purchased 2 of these and both of them broke very easily. While the top ring shows a wall thickness of say, 1/8\" +/-, the lower walls are almost paper thin.\n \n  Nice\n \n  Definitely seconds.

If you need glass then look else where. It's most likely Acrylic which is a good material and if you like to have the clarity of glass but the strength closer to plastic this this IS your item. I would give it 5 stars if it was labeled correctly.\n ", "\n  I bought this for Valentines. It was too narrow for the big bundle of rose I bought. The flower could not touch the water level unless I\u2019m adding a lot of water. And I don\u2019t want to fill too much water into it because the center of gravity would be too high and it may fall.\n \n  For what this item is, the price point is a little high, you\u2019d be better going to your local arts and crafts store and picking one up for less money. With the dimensions being so tall and narrow, it needs a heavier base to battle the inclination to tip over. It works fine for what I intended it for, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely worth the price.\n \n  Beware!!!  First i bought 2 and the bottom of the vase was different, one had thick glass the other was very thin.  Like a dummy i ordered 1 more to see if i could match one but i didnt measure the glass first. So i did receive a new glass that was thick on the bottom.  That is when i tried to put my candle in them to find out no go.  They say 4\u201d well it isn\u2019t and the opening wasn\u2019t even 3 1/2\u201d.  Will just trash them because getting boxes and shipping would be what they cost. So very  Disappointed .\n \n  I'm a party planner.i order frequently.this order was horrible.the glass was what dented.. nicked in glass making, uneven.and I would send back but my wedding is saturday.and need bling wrapped today to be ready...refund or half money back is needed\n \n  Used on my sweet table. Perfect ! And wrapped with care !\n \n  Seems as if seller made a great effort to ensure no breakage would occur with they way they packaged it. All 12 pieces arrived unharmed. The product was of constant thickness and exactly what the description described and what I imagined. I needed more than 12 but wanted to ensure quality with one order before I ordered a second unit of 12 and I absolutely intend too order more.\n \n  Perfect for my client\u2019s design. As an interior designer you want to make sure that everything is perfect for the reveal!! Great quality\n \n  Longer then I anticipated. But it\u2019s  my fault for not looking at measurements but it still works.\n \n  Chipped on the top and hairline cracks. \n  We needed an extra base because where we originally ordered them one of the vases was broken. Running out of time we took advantage of the 2 day shipping. This case was slighty taller then our other 14inch but it worked perfectly.\n ", "\n  BEAUTIFUL, what an eye catcher in my hallway!! I added white gravel with willow catkin branches and it earns many compliments. If put in a corner it is stable enough to not fall over. Also, the added gravel helps with stability.\n \n  Order 2in floating candies 3 in are too big for these vases. Great quality vases though. Would purchase again\n \n  Vases are exactly what I needed! I still need to check how durable they are because I just got them. They feel light so I am trying to be careful not to break them. I ordered 18 vases and they all got here well pack and in perfect condition.\n \n  Nicely designed and heavy glass will last for a long time. A very nice addition to our home. I would recommend to anyone looking for an item of this nature.\n \n  These are going to be used for candles at a reception.  They are excellent quality came individually boxed, heavy glass.  Will work out perfectly.\n \n  This is the third one I have bought. No fault to the manufacturer though. My dogs keep knocking them off the table. I would recommend the quake hold stuff so that it doesn't tip over.\n \n  Ordered glasses they are two different sizes and obe is thicker than other smh\n \n  I used this vase as a centerpiece for a table, very pleased with the product.\n \n  Items arrived ahead of schedule. Glass cylinder arrived without any damage. The seller and merchandise are highly recommended. Purchased this items 2 times without any problem.\n \n  Looks very nice with a bamboo plant with stones inside. Very sturdy.\n ", "\n  Arrived with no breakage and is sturdy and beautiful.\n \n  Excellent case at a reasonable price! Served its purpose perfectly.\n \n  I would truly give this product no stars! I am not returning this absolutely shattered thing. It's a waste of time but I do want a refund!\n \n  Vases are good quality and great price! They all needed cleaned prior to use as they were \u201ccloudy\u201d looking. They cleaned up perfectly.\n \n  The vase arrived fine but the product itself was not what we thought we'd be getting at all. First, the glass is not cut level. Actually, it doesn't stand level, either. It leans to one side a noticeable amount. The top it cut at an angle about 4mm higher on one side than the other. \n  The inside of this glass cylinder was seriously uneven.  There were several of these in a box of 12.  Won't reorder from them.\n \n  Good clear cheap vases\n \n  I had to immediately bleach this vase as it was super funky when I got it. The quality is pretty good and perfect for what I needed it for.\n \n  This is perfect for tall flowers!\n \n  Cute vase especially for the price.\n ", "\n  Love the glasses!\n \n  Glass has a good thickness to it, not cheap or brittle, and has great clarity, used it for a DIY lighting project with led fairy lights.\n \n  These are 3 and 5/8\" vases not 4\" as advertised. A complete waste of money for me.\n \n  The cylinders arrived on time and packaged very well.  Great quality cylinders - no blemishes or bubbles in the glass.  I love them!\n \n  It\u2019s a great vase.  Very clear, no bubbles.  Sturdy and straight.  Great value for the $$.  The sticker on the bottom is tough to get off.\n \n  Nice piece and good size.

Used both for bamboo collection.\n ", "\n  I wanted to put my Lucky Bamboo in a larger container so I added small black stones to the vase with water. It looks great!\n \n  Comes with imperfections and sits slightly crooked or an evening. Just OK. The price point should be somewhere around five dollars.\n \n  It's a great vase, nothing else to say. I simply wish they were a tad bit cheaper.\n \n  This vase was called at 3\" x 9\". It is NOT 3\" ! More like 3 1/4\" . Going to return it...\n \n  Sturdy vase\n \n  Nice little vase\n \n  The vase arrived with small cracks in it, not from shipping but from its manufacture. But i kept it as I needed a vase stat.\n \n  Perfect for making a Safari theme centerpiece\n \n  Wasn\u2019t exactly the size i was looking for.  I purchased bigger one from home goods for cheaper.\n \n  Like the whole package\n ", "\n  Same as headline\n \n  Well packaged and arrived just as described.\n \n  We used one per table at our wedding (there were three different heights used) and they looked phenomenal.  We used them with a floating candle and submerged flowers.\n \n  Well packaged and as advertised.  Thanks\n \n  Excellent.  All arrived in good shape.  The looked spectacular combined with 24\" vases with tropical florals and water pearls.\n \n  We will be using these for our wedding. They all arrived in tact, no cracks! The only reason for 4 stars would be for the small imperfections in the glass. They aren't very noticeable, but it might bother others. Overall, great price for these vases! I couldn't find anything less than $20 a vase at other stores.\n \n  Item was perfect for my reception. Just as described.\n \n  Good price for the size, but the glass quality in a few of them was poor - lots of bubbles and imperfections. Not bad for my use, but would never use anywhere they could be seen closely.\n \n  Mine has just a minor little flaw in the glass.  Not enough to bother me, just turned it to the back.  The price of $12 was the best i could find.\n \n  WELL MADE .. BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON  AND A GREAT PRICE !

I'm extremely happy, because they were significantly cheaper than buying the same thing at Hobby Lobby or Michael's.\n \n  I love them and they are at a good price when buying by dozen or more.

Will update \u2b50\ufe0f if replacement is better than this. \n  I ordered one. I cut the bottom off of this as I needed it for the tube rather than a vase, and the glass was thick all the way through, not perfection, but dam good compared to most glass products being knocked out today.  Most products are very thin on the bottom sides or overly thick on one side and thin on the other. This vase was pretty thick all the way around. Not perfection but very good considering other things I have cut like this.\n \n  Bueno, bonito y barato dir\u00edan en mi pa\u00eds.

I filled them with boxwood greens and put them on my kitchen counter for the farmhouse look.\n \n  These were so cute and perfect for my living room. I thought they were going to be too small, but they are perfect. Perfect size: not too big, not too small. The bottom of these bottles have small circular felt stickers to prevent the bottles from scratching up any furniture or other surface these are on. I thought that was a nice feature. Although, they do show, but not too much. It is not a  deal breaker for me. I have provided a few pictures, and one with a tissue box for reference in size.\n \n  Very light weight I need to fill them with rocks or something but they work perfect\n \n  Just a heads up...carefully notice the heights of the 3 vases.  I should have used a ruler & \n  Beautiful! Added some faux lavender and it\u2019s a beautiful addition to our bedroom.\n \n  I put one star because it would not let me leave it blank....I normally don't write bad reviews I usually just figure some other use for it.....but when I first purchased these the choice was Priced from 22 45 73 or something like that in sets of 3 I selected the serious sizes expecting 2 small and one med.or large I figured the 45 set of 3 and 73 set of 3 where going to be all quiet large and a little too much for my dresser but for serious sizes I expect at least one descent piece and 2 small as extra accents from the description.....but honestly my 3 are all small I could have gone to Tuesday morning and got more bang for my buck my larger one is smaller than my pepper grinder I would value the set of 3 I got from 10-15 $ and even that's over priced just DISAPPOINTED all around :( and I was really looking forward to them the small 3 in front is what I got I paid less for the larger grey one behind it \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd2f\n \n  Love this set of 3 ceramic bases with a white, crackled glaze.  Looks beautiful with the cotton and lavender sprigs in our decore.\n \n  This is a very pretty trio of crackle vases.  They are a little smaller than I had imagined but with the 3 together, it works nicely on our dresser with yellow and white silk flowers in the taller middle vase with each of the smaller vases on each side as in the photo.  Very happy with my purchase and they coordinate very well with all my other jug vases.\n \n  Perfect pieces for home decor, particularly if you're going for the rustic / \"farmhouse\" look everyone is after theses days. They are so cute, great size, fits flowers or other stems nicely. I definitely recommend.\n \n  I just got my 3 vases and they are very cute. Even nicer in person. Very well packaged too. I'm very happy with them. The only thing was that there was a big chunk of glue that was stuck to the orange vase and to the box and it was a bit difficult getting it removed since it hardened on there. But in 15 minutes I got it off and it now has a mark where the paint peeled from the glue but other than that, they look great.\n ", "\n  These vases come very well packaged. They also resemble the images that are posted. They have a bit of weight to them and a rough texture, so it's not plastic or made cheaply. I really like the simplicity of these vases and I would definitely recommend or buy them as a gift.\n \n  The colors are very close to what's depicted and exactly what I needed to add color to an under-cabinet countertop corner with a 12\" opening in my kitchen.  In my set, the mottling is more subtle, though ... just enough to lend a bit more interest.  Suggest pay close attention to the heights described.  On a surface (like a library table), they really were too small without other, larger pieces dominating.\n \n  These white bottles came quick and without many issues. The only thing I would complain about is the cardboard they came wrapped in when shipped stuck to the top of the medium size bottle and I have yet to be able to remove all of the pieces. It doesn't bother me too much because it is up high enough on a shelf that you don't really notice it until you are right up on it. The coloring was very rustic looking which was great and exactly what I was hoping for. I tied some rustic looking twine around the top of each bottle and now they look even better. Would recommend to others.\n \n  The vases are much smaller than I would have liked.  However, they are nicely crafted and the colors look exactly as shown.  I have no regrets.  My only complaint would be that the vase holders at the bottom could have been placed better so that they do not protrude out past the side of the vase. (See picture).  Other than that great small vases for the price!\n \n  Great looking product, very happy!\n \n  Arrived quickly, great colors, as advertised.  Smaller than expected but perfect for my space as I\u2019m adding other things around it shortly.\n \n  Great accent vases that you're able to make what you need them to be -cute, casually elegant, bold, or subdued.  The accent depends on where and how you arrange them, along with the surrounding palette. The colors are bright, but restrained enough as not to appear cartoonish.  I guess the secret is in the distressed finish.  They look as if you've always had them, slightly faded by time.  I really like them.\n \n  These are honestly one of my favorite purchases from amazon! Beautiful and fit in perfectly with just about any room. I am able to change out the faux plants I put in the vase and change up the look any time. One of them even accidentely fell on the floor the other night and didn't even bduge. Love it!\n \n  I don't usually respond to these review requests but in this case I had to.  For me, they are absolutely perfect.  They are the centerpiece on our kitchen table, catch bright morning light and mix beautifully with the place mats and other elements in the room.  I could not be more pleased.  My husband (not one to notice decorative items too much) said \"these look really nice\".  'Nuff said.  Their color is very true to the photo.  Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.\n \n  I love the colors. A bit smaller than expected but I should have read the sizes more. I'm still in love with them\n ", "\n  I love love love love love these colors! Exactly as advertised. They went perfectly with my color scheme. And they are not too small and not too big. They are the perfect size to draw attention; they're not too dainty and cute, and they're not overwhelming. Came packaged in a box with a lot of foam around them. They have soft little feet on the bottom so you don't scratch the surface you put them on.\n \n  I read the reviews so I was prepared they were smaller than what they seem in the picture. Really cute for smaller accents. I have them in my bathroom in that, \"small, what on earth do I put there\" spot. :)\n \n  Smaller than what I was expecting.  But, it\u2019s clearly what the dimensions list.  I just envisioned something larger.  My fault. \n  These arrived in the mail very quickly. It was packaged with styrofoam and was not damaged when I opened the box. \n  These bottles are stunning!  Works great with our decor.  It has an old crackled look to the paint.  Really beautiful!  Thinking about ordering a second set.\n \n  This gorgeous, handcrafted, decorative set of 3 bottles is absolute perfection.  They all have a lovely cracked-glaze finish.  They look just like the picture.  The design is timeless, and we just love them.  They just have a wonderful, peaceful presence.  Together, they form an elegant balance but are also simply perfect individually.  They also come with tiny, smooth (white rubber, I believe) bumper pads that do not show at all but protect your table!  The large bottle would easily be worth the price for all 3.  I think this is a really great value.  We are so happy with our ASTERGARDENS purchase.\n \n  I originally purchased these for my art niche, but was disappointed with how small they were. They are now on a shelf and they look great! They came in styrofoam for safe shipping! Even though they are smaller than i expected they are still lovely\n \n  I am currently decorating farmhouse style and decided to order this set. I love the way it looks. I wish it they had bigger sizes for statement pieces but it\u2019s still very cute. It doesn\u2019t seem cheaply made and seems sturdy. I would recommend :)\n \n  The colors are nice, however, there were smaller then I expected. One of them was broken due failure of labeling (fragile on the box). So, it will be returned asap.\n \n  Way too small for the price would not recommend at all am thinking of returning these just because they are so small for the price. Very disappointed. Gave two stars for coming well packaged and not damaged.\n ", "\n  The vases themselves are beautiful and amazingly priced. I love the shattered chic look! Only isue is that one of them shipped... super glued to the box and won\u2019t come off at all. I tried soaking it in alcohol and it\u2019s on there for the long haul. Over all, great quality. Not sure what happened to that one vase though..\n \n  I loved these. I got them for a shelf in a cabinet I redid and it brought just the right amount of rustic while being classic as well. They came in great condition.\n \n  Wow These are so perfect for the project I have going. I\u2019m thinking about ordering another set, they are simple, dainty and classy. Would definitely recommend!!!\n \n  I ended up sending this back because it was too little for a fireplace vase. That is what I typed in the search and this popped up so I didn\u2019t even think about looking at dimensions. It was very nicely made just couldn\u2019t find a use for it\n \n  I purchased several new items off Amazon for my new home and this was one of my favorites. It is so worth the price. Exactly as shown in the picture. It was worth the price for sure.\n \n  These were just what I was looking for my shelf decor.  I found them on a blogger's page and decided to pull the trigger on them while we are staying at home and cannot go out and shop.  They are a great price for the quality and came perfectly packaged.  I will definitely order more products from this seller.\n \n  These vases are SMALL. They were way smaller than I thought it would be. They are pretty. I just don't like how the stickers at the bottom of the vases pop out from the side and they are visible.\n \n  Very impressed they are absolutely beautiful would definitely recommend!\n \n  I've had these jars sitting in my \"wish list\" for about a month. I finally got the courage to buy them and I LOVE them. \n  These vases are so wonderful. They are made so well and are so pretty. I have a modern farmhouse home and it\u2019s perfect for my shelving spot! Thanks so much!\n ", "\n  The reviews don't lie they look really nice in my living room and works really well as decoration even without flower. I recommend.\n \n  Well packaged. Arrived on time. Beautiful vases. Exactly as pictured. Striking colors. Put them on my fireplace mantelpiece next to some framed photos. Just gorgeous! Will order some of the other shapes.\n \n  So cute! Came well packaged. I added some jute rope to the tops to better match my mantle decor. Size is what I expected. About 10in, 7in, and 5in. I\u2019d buy again!\n \n  Love these vases! Got the white and two tone grey. Def on the smaller side but they still look fantastic together or separate. I have the white together with no branches or flowers and the grey with flowers and they all look great. The price for these is so good as they look much more expensive! They have a nice luxurious look to the material, not flat white or grey. Highly recommend!\n \n  They look really good. The box the came in is not really a nice presentation, but the vase overall looks great. Excellent option as a gift for newlyweds. They look grate in my living room.\n \n  More cute than I thought. I really like it. Will order more for my patio set. Thank you!!!\n \n  Just as pictured. I was afraid that it would be smaller than the picture made it appear. I definitely recommend.\n \n  So cute and perfect for a shelf! They're light weight, but strudy enough to hold a few flowers or stems.\n \n  Exactly as described! I honestly was looking for something bigger, but that's my fault for not properly reading the description. The vases are petite, but lovely.\n \n  I love the little vases. They look great in my living room next to my new lamps.\n ", "\n  Love the distressed look the shapes and sizes! I put them on my built-in shelf next to my fireplace. \n  The set is everything I hoped it would be, and I know that I will use it in various rooms in our home.\n \n  This three vase set is perfect. The color, the sizes, the quality is so on point. Thank you!!!\n \n  I like the shape and weight of these vases.  I am currently using them for flowers or just simple decoration on shelf.\n \n  One came in pieces and the other two have cracks all over.  Could have been an issue in handling\n \n  These are great! They look nice on my fireplace mantel. Up close they have a nice crackle oldish look to them.\n \n  The bottles are very cute and colorful . They\u2019re also priced right for gift giving . There\u2019s nothing shabby about these three colorful bottles\n \n  They\u2019re very pretty, and very sturdy. Very pleasing to look at and really pulls the room together\n \n  The vases are perfect. Color is nice, neutral.  Nice addition to decor.\n \n  Smaller-than-expected the largest vase only stands 12 in. However the picture is very accurate in the way that it looks. It is very pretty and will be used although not for its original purpose because the vases are small. But the colors are accurate.\n ", "\n  Versatile, a fair price, and good quality. You can use these vase for any season.

No cracks, breaks or chips. They arrived well packaged to protect from any shipping damage. Great pop of color, bright and vivid -  exactly as described and actually nicer looking in person than as pictured. I have been looking at similar vase sets priced much higher and these are every bit as nice and seem to be of high quality.  Little rubber feet on the bottom protect the glass surface where I have them placed. Perfect size, not too small or large. Very happy with this purchase!\n \n  Much smaller than I expected but that\u2019s my fault for not looking at dimensions. The style of these match my decor perfectly & they are made well. They even have little rubber stoppers on the bottom to help keep in place.\n \n  Cute set of vases! Goes perfect with the \"country cottage\" theme I'm trying to achieve in my living room. The vases were packaged very well, my only reason for 4 stars is that they had sort of a sticky feel to them when I took them out of their boxes, and they have brownish rings on them (from the ridges in the cardboard box?!)  A clorox micro scrubber wipe removes it, but it does take some elbow grease. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.\n \n  I love these vases. They exceeded my expectations. The colors are bright without being garish and the three colors live together happily. I never seem to have the right vase for a small bunch of flowers, so I bought these and the white and the dark gray. The brightly colored ones look really great as a display together and the flowers I got yesterday look really good in them too. Winner.\n ", "\n  First and foremost, I would've been 100% satisfied IF THESE WERE ACTUALLY WATERPROOF. The water sweat through the glaze and waterstained my wood desk over night. I am incredibly displeased. I've requested an exchange and will give them another shot and update my review accordingly. \n  Just what I needed. I had bought so many items off amazon at once and was a bit worried some of it wouldn\u2019t be great quality but I\u2019m not disappointed with anything. \n  I had hopes of these vases fitting down into a wooden arrangement I had purchased but they were slightly too big but I was so happy with them otherwise I didn\u2019t care until I put my first flower arrangements in them and 2 of them leak water from the bottom. I\u2019m presently sitting them on plant drain trays. If they didn\u2019t leak, they would be really nice.\n \n  These bottles were perfect to change up the accessories on my mantle. They are narrow enough to place slightly staggered on the shelf and talk enough to add height. While I appreciate the small circular felt circles on the bottom to keep from scratching, they are visible if you are up close.  I also purchased the faux jasmine from Amazon to place in the bottle and add interest.  They came well packaged and in tact.  Great against my dark accent wall. Love the new look!\n \n  These are for decor and not actual flowers, if you have a bouquet they aren\u2019t gonna fit FYI. But it\u2019s super well made and has pads on the bottom. Even the box is very nice looking, it comes with a foam container. I would def gift it to somebody for the holidays. For $34 I can\u2019t complain at all. You don\u2019t get such a 3piece set from Target.\n \n  From the picture, these looked more substantial with a richer look and more depth of color.  I thought they'd be a darker red than they are with a little character to the finish .  They look a little cheap and the color is somewhat flat.  I'll probably return them.\n \n  Pretty and seem to be sturdy but returned immediately upon receipt. The vases are not white, but more of a creamy tan. If you are looking for vases with a more natural tan look, these are perfect, but if you need white, you may want to look elsewhere.\n \n  I kept this on my wish list for  quite some time and it always seemed sold out. When it did come in stock, I bit the bullet and purchased. I am so glad that I bought these, they look great in my kitchen and are well made. I had no issues with shipping and they were delivered without a scratch.  I felt that they were a bit pricey but they work well in my home decor.\n \n  Nice packaging prevents breakage. Sturdy, well made. I like the protective felt pads on the bottom of these cases. Protects wood furniture and mantles. Nice neutral, classic look you can easily change up decor for the seasons.\n \n  These are very vintage looking and just what I wanted to add to my d\u00e9cor. Love the look!\n ", "\n  These are so cute. I have them on a little table by my front door. One thing that is recommended is paying attention to the sizes, they're fairly small, but if that's what you're expecting there aren't any surprises.\n \n  These vases are perfect for my purposes. I bought them to use on my mantle and am delighted at the pop of color they bring to my arrangement. Terrific value for the money\u2014better than expected. They were packaged extremely well and made the journey to Alaska intact. 100% delighted with this purchase!\n \n  Smaller than I anticipated, but the measurements were clearly listed in the description. Nonetheless, I still love them and they look fantastic under my cabinets now that they\u2019re fluffed up with some greenery.\n \n  Just received the vases in perfect condition and they are absolutely, positively beautiful, even more so in person.  The various colors and sizes are just what I was looking for as they compliment our d\u00e9cor.  Received them earlier than expected, love them, very happy with this purchase, and many thanks!\n \n  This set of vases are so cute and very well made!  I purchased the two tone gray and love them!\n \n  I was very surprised when I received this product, as I initially purchased it to place them above the cabinets. They came out to be smaller then expected. Maybe as big as a bottle of 1/2 of coke, and that's me exaggerating. I ended up keeping it, but be sure to check the measurements before purchasing them and make sure you are looking for that size.\n \n  These bottles are so beautiful. I use them on my floating interlocking shelves but with these there are so many possibilities. They can be used on tables, as a Centre peace, separate, together, with flowers or without.\n \n  Gorgeous vases. Put them near my window and they just brighten the whole room up. Really love their kind of rustic feel, and definitely gives some Autumn vibes as well. Love! \n  I love the look at these little faces however two of the rubber things were missing on the bottom and they were unstable so I just took them all off. Maybe just a little bit overpriced but they are cute.\n \n  I bought these for a bookshelf.  They work well.  Good color.  Each piece arrived in-tact.  Nice weight and balance to stand independently. ", "\n  Very cute vases. I added twine at the top of the vases for that rustic look that I\u2019m going for with some plastic greenery. I would definitely buy again if needed.\n \n  I use this to help tighten colors between a master bedroom and bathroom. It gave a nice tropical feel.\n \n  These were well packaged, and arrived in excellent condition.  I love these vases--they are really pretty.  They have kind of a \"dirty/cracked\" finish, which is exactly what I was looking for (a rustic feel).\n \n  Super cute and looks better than the photos. They had a good weight to them so they don\u2019t feel cheap. Love the color and love how cute they can fit in with anything. Very happy with my purchase!\n \n  Very nice set with vibrant colors. Great size for a small grouping. I really enjoy them on my entry hallway table and see them multiple times each day.\n \n  These small vases look very nice, and we're very happy with them.  They are slightly off-white, so be aware of that.\n \n  Just received them yesterday and I love them!!!  So very nice!!!  The color is off white.\n \n  These are very pretty and look exactly as pictured. They come nicely packaged, so would be perfect for a gift.\n \n  I really like the look, but they must be pretty fragile because the medium one was cracked when I received it. The cost is too high for the quality. I'll just use it with cracked side facing the wall and hope it doesn't break more.\n \n  Very nice set. The vases seem sturdy and they have a little weight to them so I don\u2019t fear my bouquets falling over.\n ", "\n  Very sturdy vases.  I had read some reviews that said that the product had arrived broken, but it seemed well packaged to me and the vases came unbroken.  Very nice pieces.\n \n  I love these vases!  They are the perfect size to be placed on a windowsill or a table.  They are well-made and just what I was looking for aesthetically!\n \n  I love these vases! They add just enough color and paired with a vintage candy dish make my coffee table looking amazing!!! They were intended to be a gift, but I decided to keep them!\n \n  Very cute set.  I wasn't expecting them to be this nice but they are a great decorating addition.\n \n  Quite pleased with this product. Well made and came with furniture protection pads on the bottoms.\n \n  Better than I expected... looks like an antique and goes perfectly with my decor\n \n  They are good quality, however they are much smaller than I anticipated.\n \n  Cute farmhouse style. I use it with a little lavender sprigs in it.\n \n  The color goes with any shade and design you have. Looks good on our chest of drawers in the bedroom. Would recommend these items to anyone who is into decorations.\n \n  I love this added addition to my kitchen table\n ", "\n  Very nice quality!  This was my second time ordering them.\n \n  Nice set of smaller vases. Sturdy but pretty\n \n  it looks cute, color is not too bright but not dull either. why a 4-star, it's because it looks so small in my mantle, it really does not stand out. otherwise, nicely package and fasat shipping.\n \n  Very nice, good size and great pop of color.

Just what I needed.\n \n  I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting much from these little vases, but I was wrong! They look and feel like something from a high end home boutique.\n \n  they are a little smaller than expected, but they are very nice I love them. The added little protection on the bottom so they won't scratch the surface they are sitting on is an added bonus. So cute and will add that fixer upper touch I am going for.\n \n  Use days to set up staging and a house for sale I thought they were a nice touch\n \n  These vases were just what I was searching for to place in a particular spot. They are well made and hold greenery just right.\n \n  They are so cute! I love how they look with a bouquet of flowers.\n \n  Thought they were a bit larger but work well as accent pieces for my bedroom. Happy.\n ", "\n  Good size and they look really nice.\n \n  Good quality product. Pretty. Exactly as described. Only issue was the packaging left some glue remnants on the orange vase and the carboard packaging was stuck and if was hard to get off. Really good otherwise!\n \n  Colors true to picture.

It\u2019s just big enough to fit comfortably on a large windowsill. The quality is really sturdy and solid and looks just like the photo. You could put large flowers in this - sunflowers or something that could match its height. I highly recommend.\n \n  Good looking vase, overall good quality.

Looks great In my house, added a eucalyptus and cotton also from amazon.\n \n  Looks just like shown in pictures. Very happy with purchase\n \n  like it.\n \n  The Stone & Beam Emerick Rustic Stoneware Vase is an absolutely beautiful, tall and textured vase. This vase is solid and heavyweight.  It really looks like a much more expensive vase.  It is a very good quality 100% stoneware vase.  I absolutely love it.\n \n  This is a really nice decorative vase. It's fairly big, so it can handle large plants or flowers, or even decorative items. The styling on it is nice enough that it can be used empty, as a piece of its own. We set it on top of our piano just as it is and it looks great. Very nice, good quality.\n \n  This vase looks equally nice ... empty, or with flowers.  It is also heavy and solid, and a nice size.  It looks good with a wide variety of flowers and decor.\n \n  This vase goes so well with another one by the same company. They look wonderful in my master bath. Even my husband had to admit that it was perfect.\n \n  This is a great decorative vase.  The pattern is well done and very even.  It stands well on its own.  It looks great in my space and is very good quality and well made.\n \n  I was buying this as a gift for my sister. Despite many other positive reviews, I found myself very disappointed with the quality of the vase. The patterns are very inconsistent. There are multiple parts where the patterns are either incomplete or messed up. If you want a high quality vase product look somewhere else.\n \n  Nice vase and arrived packaged well (no damage). It was a little larger than anticipated, but looks nice.  There's a light, rough sand texture to the exterior of the vase, which is less pronounced where glazed with the white. The inside is smooth and white glazed. The bottom is level and untextured which is nice - it doesn't seem like it will scratch up the table. Ours only holds fake flowers so no comment on how it handles liquid.\n ", "\n  This Stone & Beam Emerick Rustic Stoneware Vase is strictly decorative but it is attractive. I using these vases in my house staging, especially when taking photos. The vase is attractive and well made. It is heavy and has solid walls on the vase. I like to place one on the mantle and one on the floor by the fireplace. It works well to give an ambiance or feel but if you have small kids or toddlers, be careful as they can knock them over if they are within reach.  This is one of those items where I can't actually describe the best place to locate it but you will know once you put it somewhere whether or not it looks good. It has to be tried in different locations in the house to figure out the right one. The design almost reminds me of Native American or South of the Border if you live in the United States.  It's a nice piece of mainly decorative value.\n \n  In person, this vase looks pretty much identical to its product photos.  The design is really clean and modern looking, and fits perfectly with our mid-century modern decor.  Despite being pretty tall and narrow, it feels pretty stable because of the weight.  We put some fake flowers into ours to keep in the guest bathroom.\n \n  This vase is the perfect mix of clean, modern and rustic. It\u2019s even prettier (and bigger!) in person than it looks online. It has a nice heft to it and seems well-made. \n  I have this in my backyard by the plants and it's a lovely focal point.  Looks classy, with a heavyweight textured finish.  Very tall.

I usually don't like to spend too much money on vases/object d'art around the house, but this is my only fancy vase, and it was absolutely worth it. Since this was for my own home, I purchased a Warehouse Deal, which was better priced than a brand new one. This has served me very well as a beautiful showpiece in the living room. The glass/crystal is stunning and the design is perfectly cut to show-off the incredible sparkle of the thick glass. I'm not sure of the crystal, but the vase does not feel cheap, it is weighty and substantial. \n  I grew up in a house where there had to be fresh flowers in every room all the time. My mother would fill gorgeous crystal vases with flowers cut from the garden or ordered from the florist nearly every day. Of course she had amazing vases in all shapes and sizes, most were Lalique. I grew up admiring her flowers and vase collection. \n  I am sure it must have been beautiful, but when I started to open the box, fine shards started to fall out and I realized it had been shattered.  I did ship it to myself overseas, so I have no idea of where it was when it actually broke, but what I can say is that in the past I have received soap that was wrapped in bubble wrap and surrounded by other packing material inside the box.  This piece was hardly prepared for shipping to an address across the street, let alone overseas.  I will buy this at a store, but will never risk shipping this sort of thing again.\n \n  Beautiful vase that looks amazing with a bouquet. The shape allows the flowers to spread out perfectly. Very heavy crystal and looks very classy, would make for an excellent gift. Super happy with my purchase, worth every penny!!!\n \n  Bought them as Christmas gifts for my sister-n-law and best friend and they both loved the vases. It's  a very pretty vase, I thought.  I would buy again.\n \n  The price is 60% under manufacturer suggested price.  I had seen it on other web sites at full price, but Amazon had the best price by far.  Can be displayed with or without flowers.  I have other Waterford pieces and had expected Sparkle to be more like crystal.  It is a heavy vase and attractively designed, but just does not have the cut crystal edges and quality I had hoped for.\n \n  i attempted to wash the one we had in hot water. It cracked smoothly in half. I had to replace it before my wife found out and when I explained the package at the door and opened it, she cried with joy. She briefly thought she would never see one again.\n \n  You're not going to get the chiseled sharp cuts like a Waterford made vase (you knew that though as they are hundreds of dollars), but the Waterford crystal used in making these is top notch and the pattern is nice.\n \n  Excellent! I Love this vase and the weight and the style. This vase is a perfect night and with of opening on the top. It won\u2019t disappoint.\n \n  Its so nice in shape and really good in price\n ", "\n  Item arrived earlier than promised and in brand new condition\n \n  This has been my go to gift for my parents, in-laws, and grandparents on both sides for two years now. Because is name brand they always think I spent a fortune on the vase. It\u2019s very thick and heavy crystal. The box says it retails for 100$, they can just think you did! Amazon win!\n \n  This is such a beautiful vase, I am really impressed. It feels expensive and very good quality glass. The design is also really nice.\n \n  My sister in law was incredibly pleased to receive this vase at Christmas. I started her collecting Waterford and she loves this new addition.\n \n  Great Wedding gift\n \n  Bought this for a \"big\" birthday of my best friend.  I love Waterford and I know this size vase will hold so many different kinds of flowers during the year.  It's leaded so it's heavy enough to handle heavy-stemmed flowers without tipping. She was delighted!\n \n  This very beautiful vase would compliment any table in your home.  I bought it because it was narrow along the bottom and gradually got wider as you reached the top.  I wanted the flowers to blossom out so they looked fuller.  Keep in mind that's it's heavy because it's a Waterford.\n \n  Quality, thick cut crystal vase for a great price.

I had to ask her after she received it if everything was okay with the delivery. She said it was a beautiful vase and was so happy with the gift.

Her young daughter even mentioned how beautiful it was and thanked me. This was a great gift for my friend. Thank you.\n \n  I sent this vase as a gift to a friend, and it was very well-received.

I recommend it.\n \n  A beautiful more modern pattern for Waterford Marquis.\n \n  This was appreciated by my niece as a very nice Housewarming gift !\n \n  Great value\n ", "\n  Perfect!  Just what I needed and at a good price.\n \n  This is beautiful, and worth the price!!\n \n  Very nice - just as I expected.\n \n  I've always wanted a nice crystal vase.  But, I didn't want to spend $100 on a vase.  I wanted a vase to hold an arrangement of blue & white silk hydrangea in my family room.  I bought higher end silk flowers because I wanted a natural look.  I have a round mahogany drum table.  The top has a leather center w/ about a 2\" wide mahogony rim around that leather.  I put it in a corner that has a window on each side.  The sun hits this vase from one window in the morning & the other window in the afternoon.  Sparkle is the perfect name for this vase.  The light hits the cuts and bounces off, creating little prisms of light on my walls.  The detail in the vase conceals the stems quite well.  Unless you go up close, you can't tell that the arrangement is not made of of real hydrangea.  I really wanted a bit taller vase.  But, with a price of $39.99, I decided to give this a try and I love it.  It is hold 2 large blue hydrangea  with about 10 blooms each & 4 smaller white hydrangea with about 5 blooms each.  The arrangement sits at the perfect height in this vase.  I wouldn't recommend this vase for long stemmed roses.  But, you could pick up a 15 - 20 stem floral arrangement & it would look amazing in this vase.  You might be able to fit more than 20 stems depending on how thick the stems are.  I have perennial gardens & am looking forward to using this vase for my homegrown flowers.  This vase has a nice weight to it.  I don't worry about my curtains blowing with a breese & knocking this off the table.  This vase is sturdy.  I will not be putting this away in my hutch.  This will be used year round.  It washes up beautifully in hot, soapy water.  I used a homemade window cleaner that has water, vinegar, & a bit of baking soda in it.  It's very mild & gave the vase a nice shine.  I really like that this vase has a more modern look to it.  I didn't want anything that looked overly ornate.  This vase is pretty neutral and will go with any decor.  It comes well packed in an attractive grey box making it a ready to go gift.  That grey box was packed inside a shipping box w/ lots of shipping peanuts to protect it.  The seller did an excellent job of packing this to ensure that it arrived unbroken.  I'm never disappointed when I purchase Waterford or Marquis by Waterford.\n \n  I received a smaller Marquis by Waterford vase from a dear friend last Christmas and was amazed at the quality!!!!  This line from Waterford is lead free so it does not have the prismatic qualities of true lead crystal.  BUT, it is just as HEAVY, THICK, AND FINELY CUT!!!!!  I ordered this vase for a wedding present and I know my friend will LOVE it.  I was amazed at the heavy weight and thickness of the crystal.  The beautiful Waterford cuttings in the glass are flawless.  The vase is even etched on the base with the Waterford logo by Marquis.  Only a true Waterford connoisseur could spot the difference!!!  A truly remarkable price for what you receive!!!!\n \n  This case is so elegant! All of my guest when see it swears that it sparkles like a shining  star. I must say that it is placed wear the sun \n  Don't expect the same quality with this *Marquis* product.  This is not the Waterford cut crystal that you are accustomed to seeing for $200 or more.  Pay less, get less.  75% of the people who see it won't know but to anyone with experience the differences are obvious.  Has the feel of *cast* and not *cut* crystal.\n \n  Nice giving it to the wife for her anniversary roses\n \n  I got this for a client's Christmas present this year and was I ever so impressed with the beauty and quality of the vase.  Its so pretty and of great weight!  Its a perfect present.  You wont be sorry.  You might even keep it for yourself!!!!  I got one for me too!!!\n \n  Received today.  Absolutely stunning.

It is a matte black on the outside and shiny on the inside. I love the way it looks on my counter and fits the utensils perfectly! I\u2019m sure a plant would look lovely too.\n \n  Love this vase! Modern & sleek! Beautiful with tulips!\n \n  Very sophisticated look .  Looks great in my contemporary hone\n \n  Received these and absolutely love how they show off anything I put in them...\n \n  Really nice vase. Good quality and is as it appeared in pictures.\n \n  Tiny in person. Didn't like as much as I thought I would. Ended up returning.\n \n  I originally thought I could use it to put in the 2 remote controls of the living room, but I feel bad using it for that, is so pretty on it's own, no need for plants or anything, is a beautiful modern style vase.\n \n  Modern design. Lateral lines add a nice and cool dimeson to this piece. Cool d\u00e9cor, or, could be a practical piece with a plant or flowers. Sturdy and is ceramic. Clean white piece.\n \n  Modern usually means European, and I'd describe this as either.  Looks great, nice quality.\n ", "\n  This Hamilton Macphee & Tonbridge 6.9\" H White Textured Ceramic CORRU Wide Vase is excellent! \n  This one is staying in the house. It\u2019s a awesome little vase and I\u2019m planning to put a orchid in it. The look and feel tell me it\u2019s a quality vase and it\u2019s from a known artist. Four Stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f!!!\n \n  Item is exactly as described and pictured, but it is on the small side.  The shape also is a bit likely to tip when full if item placed in it are top heavy.\n \n  Love it, nice and tall with a simple textured design.\n \n  I've been looking for just this vase for awhile now.  It arrived today in perfect shape and looks fantastic with my decor.  The vase has a matte and textured exterior and a smoothly glazed interior.  The measurements allow it to hold quite a large bunch of flowers, since the top is a wider oval shape.  I like how balanced the vessel is, not top or bottom heavy, so it is nice and stable when filled even with taller stems. \n  Great vase is sturdy and easy to clean. Fits a large bouquet.\n \n  This vase looks great and fits perfectly to our new living room decor. We did some renovation work on our living room over summer, and gray was the color to use. We have rustic antique furniture in light wood and we are still finding small pieces that fit and accent the room. This vase was without a doubt a perfect fit. Its modern uneven oval design with the ribbed texture gave it a look that just sets it apart from the other pieces we have. The darker gray gave the perfect contrast to the light gray walls. The vase size couldn't be better. It fits on our coffee table or commode without overwhelming. It can be decorated with dried flowers, or any type of floral decor as well as faux plants. We are absolutely thrilled with the vase and find it to be very unique. it is a high end and high quality designer vase that deserves to be displayed and enjoyed. It is a great addition to our room, and it is a fantastic value for such a beautiful piece. It gets and deserves 5 stars.\n \n  I want to love this. I love the white color (matte) and I love the organic shape that isn't quite the perfect circle.  I love the vertical lines embossed in it. It looks thoroughly modern and hip. \n  This planter is a beautiful, well made statement piece. I love the look and the matte texture. It's sophisticated. It was lovely to unpack it and find a story about the artist. Highly recommended.\n ", ""]}, "/Decor-Vintage-Decoration-Artwork-Picture/product-review/B07YQW6B3D/ref=sxin_10_sxwds-deals-bau?cv_ct_cx=vase&dchild=1&keywords=vase&pd_rd_i=B07YQW6B3D&pd_rd_r=ccbe9a5b-7ded-4f13-8458-7c113fe4cec1&pd_rd_w=zwcGt&pd_rd_wg=RktVn&pf_rd_p=9b65e83a-b8e3-4a1c-ab20-1ef7610ede99&pf_rd_r=9E2WH5F77V9QT8626A0P&psc=1&qid=1603714075&sr=1-3-3bda29d0-07d0-4eb3-a69d-ba57e1bd0cd8": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["ECO-FRIENDLY:Our canvas wall art decor use waterproof sunfast canvas material and certified eco-friendly paint for stunning quality and lasting durability.", "100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE: We are committed to quality canvas oil painting and your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed.

So light weight to hang ... Love it \ud83d\udc99  Relaxing to look at !\n \n  I have a beach themed bathroom so I needed some beach themed art for one wall. Nothing fancy, just something fun. There are two versions of this painting - the turtles face opposite directions so that seemed perfect to me as I would hang them up facing each other. The other one is great. This one looks like a child painted it. The turtle is a bit of a blobbed mess. It doesn't look like a real turtle it looks like a cartoon or child's rendering of a turtle. I am thinking may be I got a bad one?  Anyway, the canvas does look like plank and I hung the thing up anyway but it irks me everytime I see it. \n  It was a nice surprise that it was exactly what I wanted \ud83d\ude0a  The print on the canvas was so vibrant with violet sage bushel laying next to the 2 candles so real like & candle wicks with a flame !!! canvas was nice, off white violet with a suttle light wood strokes behind the violets & purple candles that look so realistic ..... I had to share this review with anyone wanting what you see ..... Very well made & easy to hang which is attached as well ..... \n  I am an artist. My work is very abstract and within my own system. But this is a great gift or purchase for anyone. The copy is printed on a canvas that is stretched over a 1/2-3/4\u201d wooden frame. So it\u2019s ready to hang. The art also looks like it\u2019s printed on distressed wood. I love seeing art like this available at this price. It allows for a great look and style for the type of price that most might believe that the actual delivered piece.. would somehow be flawed or ??? But this is worth three times the price and what I really like is the casual and cool canvas on wooden frame style that looks better to me than in a frame. I have done this when printing digital art on high resolution specialty printer; and my 48\u201dx48\u201d canvas then stretched on a larger wooden frame. The addition of a frame would waste this look. If the art is replicated or printed on glossy film super large archival paper (or just printed on a smaller glossy film like paper); then a frame would be needed along with the print being attached to foam core or another mounting material. So, I wondered off... this is a super nice addition to any wall!\n \n  This painting is NOTHING like shown in the photos!! It is tiny! I can't imagine the microscopic furniture they used to show the scale. The color is faded looking. Not nearly as rich and saturated as in the representation. I took a picture to show. No where to upload.\n \n  This Sea Turtle print shipped in a very timely manner,I love everything about it! It makes me so relax when I am in bathroom.. I will order a new prints for my bedroom\n \n  Very lovely and serene looking. Perfect for our bathroom renovation theme.\n \n  Really cute and added a splash of color to my beach house bathroom but it was a tad costly for printed canvas with texture, however I would recommend if the colors are right for you!\n \n  Perfect! Good quality! Looks beautiful\n \n  I love this picture so much and wish I would have gotten the larger size! It really adds a nice touch to my guest bedroom. Came in great condition.\n ", "\n  You get what you pay for.\n \n  I bought this picture and two more that have the purple flowers for my bathroom. It's very pretty and makes the room look serene. Great value and the picture is done well.\n \n  Just beautiful, a large size to fit perfect in my bathroom with my white and purple decor, and the price was great deal.\n \n  Super cute product, looks just like the picture (it is a piece of printed canvas stretched over a frame, NOT pieces of painted wood). Made a great addition to our bathroom and has not wavered in quality even being in a steamy room for two months. Great value.\n \n  Its beautiful and one of a kind. I was very satisfied with this product. Wish they made more floral-beachy canvases like this.\n \n  I was pretty disappointed in this print.
