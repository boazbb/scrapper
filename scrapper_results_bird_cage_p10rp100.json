Great size, small enough for me to carry, yet comfortable for my little red face lovebird. The included accessories work, and there is still room for other toys. I do however wish that there was a bottom rack, so that my bird doesnt have to stand in her droppings when she explores the bottom of the cage. I have a strange use for this item but it works perfectly for my needs. I like to grow herbs indoors but my cats love to eat those herbs. Some of those herbs are dangerous to cats so I decided to look for some kind of small cage. This fit what I needed. It's tall and wide enough. There are also several easy to access points. The top comes off easily enough as well as the 2 doors in the front. I have no idea how this is as a bird cage but I imagine having birds in it would be fine. It's sturdy. I might not trust the doors to stay closed if I had an animal inside, though. They kind of click into place but it isn't significant. I think I'd feel safer if I clipped the doors shut somehow. Maybe with some kind of twisty tie or hair clip. This is a tiny cage if for birds as intended. I would only use this for traveling and not as a home. good price, 2 feeding cups, 2 perches plus a swing. it also has a pull out tray so that's a major plus. Um... wow... uh... I wasn't expecting this to be so small. I like this cage because I can hang it on my wall and my parakeet spends quite a bit of time outside of this cage with my other bird so it works perfect for night time for us if you're Bird spends a lot of time in their cage I would not recommend it. Same as every other review, will preface by saying this is not a full-time cage for any bird (hopefully no one is seriously buying this thinking that...) but is a nice size for smaller birds' lightweight travel cage and perfect to take with you out for some sunshine etc. It would make a decent sleep cage as well but my guy does great sleeping in his flight cage so haven't bothered. I didn't have my hopes up very high, I imagined \"its a bird cage how can you mess it up\" but when I got it and put it together I was so happy it was SOO cute and the PERFECT size for my little budge. And I didn't notice it matches her color (bonus).  When I got her inside it really is bigger than it looks from the outside. The bowls fit nicely and don't fall/tip over, and the rods are pretty solid when installed. Shes not too sure about the little swing but I have it in there anyway cause its TOO CUTE.  The only thing its missing which isn't really a drawback necessarily is having a swing open door on the front so you can access the entire cage without having to stick your hand through the sliding doors. If you were handy and had the tools you could probably fashion it to do this but like I said its still fine as is. Would/will buy again. I bought this to be a traveling cage for my one budgie. He has a much larger main cage that I don't mind traveling with, but vet appointments are better with a smaller cage. None Built this traveling bird cage per the instructions. I should have kept reading more reviews regarding the bottom portion... We bought this to take our Birds to the vet to clip their wings, however upon traveling the bottom portion fell off for no apparent reason and we lost one bird save your money and save your birds do not purchase poor quality ", "This cage makes a great travel cage for birds and rodents alike. I use it mainly as a \"playpen\" for my 2 rats; their full time cage is too large to move around so for playtime, i put them in this small cage with the door fixed open and food and a water bottle so they have a place to dart in and out of. It keeps them comfortable during free roam time. I also have used it to transport my rats when moving house, it works great for that too. That being said, this cage is not an appropriate size to be a full time living area for any animal. Not mice or rats or canaries or budgies. It is way too small to be a full time living space. Number one warning to those looking at this cage is this is only a proper cage for travel or temporary housing. I bought this to take my bird to the vet and to ride in the car on camping trips and was so excited to get it because the travel cage I have now is too big. This cage did not clip together. There was nothing to hold the bottom plastic part to the wire part. I have put together many cages but this cage had nothing to secure the bottom to the wire and the roof either. So it's just 3 pieces sitting on top of one another...useless. I don't ever write bad reviews but this would have put my lovebird in danger so... I\u2019m using this cage for two parakeets/budgies as a travel cage and cleaning cage. Don\u2019t use for normal everyday cage!! Included perches, bowls, and swings were great except I only got 3 perch hooks instead of four. Wasn\u2019t the end of the world but would be nice to have all 4. Other than that it arrived in 1 and 1/2 days. Recommend buying. This cage is little over priced for the size. Build quality is good with basic accessories. But please note under any circumstances you should NOT use this cage as main cage for bird of any size. Not even finch or love birds. It is too small for any bird's healthy and happy living. I bought it for occasional travel and for my bird's night sleeping area, in day she spends in a 6 feet cage or free flying around home. I bought this birdcage for my grandsons cockatiel, he looked at the dimensions and said it would be big enough, but when I got it and assembled it it really was a little too small. This cage was a really nice cage and I wish it had been big enough so we could\u2019ve kept it. I had no trouble returning it and I would order from them again. It's cheap and light and I'd keep my hand on the bottom just to be sure.  I used it to move my conure 900 mile by car.  It was big enough for a long one day drive and small enough to sit on the front seat of my car.  It would be fine as a permanent cage for a small bird like a finch, but I'd only recommend for temporary uses. We have a larger cage (same brand) at home, but this cage is perfect for travel. We travel with 2 dog crates & lots of dog \u201cthings,\u201d which doesn\u2019t leave much room for the birds & the cage can\u2019t be next to the dog crates. Fits perfectly in the back of the SUV with the luggage & they get lots of light from the back window. Happy chirping sounds the whole trip. When we get to our destination, the cage hangs easily. This cage is the Betta bowl of bird cages. It is suitable for keeping your bird contained and alive* but you should be actively working on doing better for your pet. I see a lot of people using this cage as a travel cage, I would be terrified to do that. I had to bend wire back into shape to get this cage together and I couldn't use some of my spare toys and perches without distorting it. They make hard sided bird carriers that are not far off from this size and price range. I have two I got at petco. I don't know what people want for $14 but I have to tell I LOVE this cage.  I keep my canary's main cage clean and hate putting him him a small box while I do that.  This is a GREAT cage for going to the vet or as I said a temp cage for when you clean your bird's cage.  Yes it is small up to a parakeet for the things I mentioned but not for a main cage.  Not enough room.  I cleaned his cage today and was not stressed while I took his main cage apart to clean. ", "We use this cage to take our Cockatiel outside with us to get some sun and just hang out. We take the top off and on to put her in as opposed to using the door. I like this brand because I KNOW they use bird safe paint. This cage works for what I need it for: travelling short distances with my small bird.  I would NOT recommend putting ANY animal in a cage this small for long periods of time.  It is far, far to small for that.  It could possibly be used for a sleeper cage, but even then it would have to be a very small bird. I'm used to judging macaw cages, I would say this is a delicate cage that I would be afraid to drop. I needed a rescue/hospital cage for wild birds to recover. One that I could hang if needed, away from the cats. I usually get fallen nest in the spring and can't reach high up. I planned on putting the nestlings in the cage (open door) for parents to takeover in a secure spot. I got this for a \"travel cage\" for my conure.  Very nice cage and can't beat the price! The cage doesn't have a screen on the bottom so the bird stands on its poo. The picture doesn't show this so i'm so disappointed in this purchase. The cage is so tiny i feel bad my bird had to stay in it.  I got rid of it and purchased a larger one as my tiny bird couldn't even fly in it.  It's more of a transport cage if that. It was easy to assemble. I wouldn't recommend it for a bird to live in full time but it's a great size if it's just temporary or for traveling. I got it for my 2 budgies to have some time outside in to get some natural sunlight, warmth and fresh air. and it's perfect for that. I rescued 2 baby lovebirds from the ground beneath our Saguaro tree.  They live 15 years, and I really wanted them to be wild.  After days in shoe box I got this cage.  Perfect to leave outside during day with door tied open. The parents returned and helped raise! After a few weeks they fledged! A happy family. Babes still return to rest inside at cool misters. 100+\u00b0 F here.  Portability and size great for little ones temporary home. Tee shirt covered for coziness. For the price, this is a great cage. I only use it as a travel cage, as it would be too small for a permanent cage for any bird other than maybe a finch or other tiny bird. No problems with the construction, overall very happy, especially for the price! I bought it for a cocktail. The cage is very small and shouldn't not be advertised for birds larger than 5 inches. The bigger birds will be under stress in such a small bird cage. Also, you must secure it better. I used strings to tight it and keep the cage safer for the bird. My bird fortunately has a much bigger bird cage. I bought the small bird cage for trips to the vet. To small for anything.  Perches are plastic and hard on birds feet.  Bowls are too small to hold enough water or food for a day for even a finch.  This same company has a nice large cage available on Amazon prime for just over $40.  Go for that one for size and your birds sake! ", "I bought this for my budgie as a travel cage, but the door is just way too small! I wish I could be able to put her into the cage while she was on my finger. I feel like the only way to get a bird in there is to grab her, which is super not useful. Sorry but this cage has a crappy design. I couldn\u2019t get the cage to lock with the base and cage to lock with the roof. Ended up using zip ties to hold it together. Using this as a traveler cage so I\u2019ll be keeping it. It\u2019s cute, love the color and it\u2019s affordable. Cute LITTLE cage.  NOT big enough for a Parakeet.  Maybe 1 tiny finch at the most.  I use it as a \"travel\" cage for sale and pick up new little birds but would never leave them in it overnight! We purchased this cage for our parakeet to sleep In at night because my cats bother him in his daytime cage. It\u2019s perfect for this. But it would be way to small for day time hanging out. This is not a cage you would use long term for any size bird its just to small. But to use as a travel crate it is a good size. I have used it for my parakeets and my cockatiel when I need a temp cage or travel cage. It has worked fantastic. Sop Again this is not an appropriate size for any size bird long term. For temporary purposes its ideal. This was the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  The bird cage was broken when we got it.  The bottom is made with very flimsy plastic, and the actual cage didn't go together at all.  It was not made well, and didn't fit together correctly.  We sent it back the same day we got it. I bought this to put my parrotlet in when we sit out on our patio.  It is the perfect size for this.  I wouldn't consider using it as a permanent home because it is too small.  He will be very happy to be outside in this.  It isn't the best quality, but suits the purpose and was a good price. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure.  I live in Southwest Florida and needed a cage asap to evacuate my bird in before hurricane Irma hit.  The cage is small, but perfect for what I needed.  I am greatful for Amazon prime shipping for getting the cage to my location just on time! Excellent sleep cage for lovebird.  Not recommended for pemanent cage, too small for any bird. This is very cute. I have a Parrolette and purchased this to carry her back-and-forth to the vet. It would be much too small for any bird I can think of, as a home ", "I was somewhat reluctant to buy this one bc of the size but it's meant to be a travel cage...the base can be easily broken the metal cage came warped and the doors dont even stay closed so a bird could easily open it and escape. Spend a little extra and go with something else. Good little cage! Perfect for small birds! We used to when we rescued a baby sparrow, once it had fledged and wanted to learn to fly. This cage is very small.  It is built well but really should only be used as a temporary cage or a travel cage.  My only problem, other than the size, was with the plastic perches.  The ends of the perches are also plastic and very flimsy.  I doubt they would last very long. Wouldn't hold up very well with daily use but it works as a travel cage or for a newly weaned baby bird. I think the price is a tad high for what you're getting. I bought this cage to transport my bird. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. Some people travel with dogs, I travel with my bird and this cage is a great deal for the money! Used it to raise a baby wild bird. Will put plants in it now. Wife likes the size and design. I bought this to pick up my bird from the bird store. It was a good size and easy to assemble. I did take it apart completely to clean it. It\u2019s a great cage for a smaller bird but it is way too small for any bird other than a parakeet at best. The only reason I got it was so that I could put my cockatiel in when I picked him up or if I need to take him somewhere. It\u2019s a great cage for short trips but I would never use this as my cockatiels cage! Good size for what I need it for..the only thing I'm not happy with is I was double charged.. This cage is TINY!  I'd never put a pet bird in here for longer than a day or so, however I had an injured finch in the yard and I'm keeping it in here until it heals.  Works well for this purpose.  Its easy to put together. ", "Very tiny thats my fault for not reading dimensions but everything for the cage is made out of cheap plastic This does good for 1 parakeet or small bird. Its nice. Not very good , few days later and it\u2019s trash The cage was way smaller than I had expected. I think it would be an okay size for an outdoor cage for a parakeet or smaller. The construction of the cage itself is pretty flimsy (easily bendable), but we're able to make do with it. Got this as a great value, use it to take parakeet to vet when necessary. Would not recommend using this as a full time home for a bird as it's just too small. But good for travel situations Smaller than I expected but can fit my Quaker parrot for the short time it takes to clean his regular cage. Not good for long term unless you have a very small bird. Small but ok for the price. This product is good for 20$ and 20$ only great small cage for a very small price. The cage is small and could never hold more than one small bird. This mini cage looks okay for the design, but the problem is lack of grid at the bottom of the cage, so the bird will jump around with its dropping and carries it everywhere. ", "Very flimsy. Only product I have ever returned to Amazon. When assembled it did not feel secure enough that I would place a birdie inside. Awesome cage just right size for a parakeet makes cleaning easier. I needed something to put my cockatiel in while I took his cage outside and gave it a good scrubbing. This little cage fit the bill. I would use it for my purpose or for transporting a bird, but it is too small for a permanent home. Great value for the price. Perfect size for travel. Doesn\u2019t have a floor lining to prevent birds from going after their poop, food or whatever on the floor. NEED TO ADD THIS IMPORTANT PART TO ANY CAGE!!! For the price is too little Much smaller than what the picture shows We purchased this to transport our budgie to the vet. It was perfect. I bought this product as a travel cage for my parrotlet. It was easy to put together upon arrival and perfect for what I ordered it for!! The perches are cheap plastic and so is the swing. But, for the price you can't beat it! I would not recommend this as a permanent house for your bird, but perfect for travel! I loved it very reasonable price ", "My bird where opining up the feeder doors and flying out. Very useful and practical, since I can walk it wherever I want in the house, so that I don't feel alone and wherever I go inside the house. Good for extra small Budgie birds ! It\u2019s a bit small... it\u2019s perfect for one bird only or for traveling. The bird likes it. Easy to clean. Small cage Easy Assembly Perfect small cage for travel and for when I need to clean the bigger cage I can transfer my parakeet quickly over. It's sturdy but I do agree with some other reviews that the door needs a little work because it's not as secure. Cute Easy to put together. Just didn't really like how it's made. Very flimsy. ", "i've taken my parakeet many places with this as a travel cage, he loves it. Contrary to many reviews there is a pull-out piece. Easy to assemble, lightweight and makes a perfect travel cage. Pretty blue too. Just ok, a bit flimsy! very small..good for only one small bird like a zebra finch Good product and price. A little too small for my liking Feathered friend can be moved around to share our company without the worry of it being underfoot. Get what you pay for Great product.

Good size for a temporary cage. It is small. I would not leave bird in full time. in case i small bird gets hurt but cute so it is a good decoration worth the money Really small.

Worked as a transport cage for my budgie, but pretty flimsy and cheap build quality.  No grate on the floor, so that was disappointing. Good for traveling on the road. Honey loves her home It gets the job done. It is  small and not that sturdy but it\u2019ll work while I get the main cage clean Nice for travel but too small for even one budgie to live permanently. This is a good TRAVEL cage. It should NOT be used as a permanent cage for any bird. It is far too small. No bird should be kept in this space for more than a couple hours Great little bird cage, but after about a week my bird stopped moving indefinitely? :/ ", "It was a little broken, but then again it is 'USED' so i didn't expect much. The doors were attach backwards. The doors do not secure closed. We had to use twistie ties. Rescue birds once in a while or would never cage a bird. They belong outdoors flying free. This is a nice cage and easy to keep clean. Great cage. Bird died. I bought this cage for a friend whom I owed a favor.  She and her daughter are pleased. Great travel cage.

Super easy to assemble! Perfect size for my Finch! Please do not get this cage! I put it together all correctly and went to set it in my car and when I went to drive I saw that it had fallen apart literally just sitting there. Flimsy cage, terrible swing, and no shelf there to prevent my bird from walking in it's own feces. ", "I loved it! I bought this just to put injured birds in who hit the window.  Usually only need 1/2 hour and they are ready to fly away.  Much safer than a cardboard box.  Just what I needed Nice little cage.  Perfect for a small bird or animal good for 1 bird  but my bird loves it A++++++ Got what I paid for. Cage was a little misshapen and the perch bars didn't want to stay, but it did the job I got it for...a temporary overnight/travel cage for my Quaker parrot. Will be useful for when we need to travel with him. Very tiny dosen't look like the picture It is good for a little bird. Small but served my purpose of transporting my cockatiel. The cage portion is too small for the tray...the parts of the cage are of good quality, just doesn't fit together.. I'm hoping duct rape or hot glue works to fix it.... Maybe gorilla glue.

I am happy it is so easy to use! I definitely recommend! :) ", "Great for travel Good cage for the money Great little cage. perfict It's a nice cage overall but my budgie figured out how to open the cage door and is constantly coming out of her cage it's really annoying too small threw away very handy for transport. Very dumb cage to sell for a LIVE bird.  Unless you have one FINCH, this cage is a joke.  The seed cups that came with it don't even work with this cage and there is no grill for the bottom of the cage so that the bird is not walking in it's own waste! This cage is just roomy enough for a small finch or canary. It has perches that can be cut for alternative perch sites and there is a tray for easy clean up. Le falto el piso de barillas no lo trajo None ", "Very Small. Great. Perfect for my canary when I am cleaning his big cage. Would buy again. Cute little cage. Too small.

", "This is a great little cage. Pretty good size for 2 parakeets This is a lot smaller than I was expecting it to be.  Too small for a parakeet.  The plastic on the bottom is kind of cheap and the tray didn't slide in flush with it.  Still, it is cute and if you want it simply for d\u00e9cor or for a very small bird...maybe a finch...I guess it would work. This was a cheap and flimsy cage and it showed up bent...I guess you get what u pay for Too small. Not what I thought very small I love ... Instructions for installing the feeders are iffy, but the enlarged image on Amazon was helpful.  Bought this as a travel cage for my 2 budgies, definitely not a permanent home for them.  Dimensions are slightly misleading and the length/depth refer to the length/depth of the bottom blue plastic base.  The actual cage length/depth are about half an inch smaller.  Height of 15 inches is to the peak of the roof.  Maybe Prevue should have an image showing the dimensions. It's a cute little cage but I think that the dome top is a bit deceiving...I wish it was just a tad bit bigger. It seems a bit small for my small conure to move around in but I think it'd be fine for a parakeet. I'm also bummed that it doesn't have a bottom grate. I knew that before I bought it but still. Parakeet refused to enter such a small space. ", "Easy to assemble, easy to clean. My little birdie loves it.. TOO SMALL, we got a parakeet from Pet Smart and was going to put our new bird in here until it got use to our old bird (who is in a big cage) but this poor small bird couldn't even turn around in this cage, his tail feathers were being ripped out. This cade might work for fly. Not suitable for ANY size of bird. I need to return it. Muy bonita None Very study VERY SMALL! Would not recommend as a full-time home for any bird unless they get a lot of out of cage time. I got this cage as a tempory cage but would not feel comfortable keeping my bird in here 24/7. There is hardly room for toys! Great product It is smaller than I thought I got it for a canary going to have to buy a different one I would use it for  declaration not a live animal Great bird cage for my Zebra Finch. It's nice -good This is a VERY small flimsy cage. It should be noted it would only be a travel cage. It is good for that but it would be cruel to keep any bird in something this tiny. ", "My fault for buying it without looking at shape sizes. Way too small for cockatiels or parakeets. birdacage is too small but cute..... Paid 14.97 but they want to charge me 6.95 to ship it back...SMH.  I added it  on Moms on a budget and sold it for the same price!! This cage is good as a travel cage ONLY. Do not use it as a bird's main cage because it is WAY TOO SMALL even for a budgie/parakeet! For a travel cage, it's decent and sturdy. Too small for anything but the smallest bird like a parakeet and even then only for temporary use like traveling.  Way too small for a cockatiel. This is the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen, I guess you get what you pay for. Do not buy this for your bird, I bought it for a parakeet and it turns out this cage is not suitable for a bird!! None It's okay Never got to use.  Product looks fine. Extremely small.  Do not use it as an everyday cage for any bird. ", "too small I have it. It's unopened. I bought it thinking I might need it. But I don't and there is no retun option. Disappointed with that. this cage all most killed my bird should not be sold. i put my bride in it he a little guy after about 5 mins blood was all over the place . his wing was rip wide open. he ok now. do not buy this your freaks out after a few sec. My parakeet loves it. She's a little one so its a perfect cage for her. She's uncomfortable in big spaces due to being kept in a cage not bigger than this one at the pet store with multiple birds. My little Castiel loves jumping between the different levels I have for her. The food and water dishes are so easy to remove and you don't have to open the main door to get them out. I added a few more toys for her and she seems content. This cage is very very small. Only good for very small birds like a Finch. It's only good for transportation purposes as a bird should not be keep in a tiny cage. I would recommend for tiny birds only for transportation purposes only. This cage is so small! I ended up buying a cage that was much bigger only for an extra $10. I would not recommend buying this unless you live in a small studio apartment with a tiny bird. for the price it is good. I have two parakeets. it is just missing the metal grate part that goes over the bottom tray. It does not come with it, and is not a necessity I suppose. I just use this as a travel cage or a temporary cage anyway. I would NOT use this as the main cage for even one parakeet. It is far too small for that. This is good cage for taming, sick/treatment or transporting. We have a larger cage to move this guy over too after we tame him. This is a nice cage for temporary use! You can\u2019t beat the price and it is a good quality for the price! This is makes for a great travel cage. NOT to be used for full time gage for any bird, it would be cruel. Seriously, it's barely 1 square foot of space. I bought this cage for our new baby parakeet. This is our first bird, so I wasn't sure about everything that I would need, so I just started with the very basic items. This cage is very small. It is serving it's purpose right now while he's small, but I am already shopping for a larger cage to move him into. I will keep this one as a spare or a travel cage if I ever need one. But, this cage is too small to keep him in long term. He's fine for now, but I can't wait to get him a larger cage! ", "wonderful product!!! i use this as a travel cage or if i want to take my birds outside. this cage is a good size for my 2 parakeets but if you have a bigger bird like a conure it would be snug. i wouldn\u2019t recommend it to be a cage that they are in 24/7 but if you are takin them to the vet or somewhere else it\u2019s perfect because it is super light as well ! mine has lasted 8 years!! THIS IS A TRAVEL CAGE!! Do not use this for a permanent cage! You can have it for a sleeping cage but let them out all day.

It is perfect for my two cockatiels, and definitely has room for a few more. The boys have lots of room to flap and climb and plenty of room for lots of perches and toys. The cage is very sturdy and the measurements are true to the description. It pains me to leave a negative review for this product. I've had good luck with Prevue products in the past and have always felt they were a good company. If I had written a review for this cage a couple of weeks ago, it would have been 4 stars. The cage was a pain to assemble. The parts weren't labeled, a couple of the prongs were bent, and a few steps absolutely required an extra set of hands (which annoyed me, since I much prefer to do these things by myself). However, once it was put together, it was roomy and seemed good for the price. My two baby cockatiels also seem to like it! First of all I've published photos on Amazon of this product because I couldn't find any real life pictures or images of the Prevue Hendryx F050 Wrought Iron Flight Cage, X-Large. I have 7 Zebra finches, 3 males and 4 females, they are all 3.5-4.5 inches long and weigh no more than half an ounce. Super awesome for the price!!! My 8 parakeets LOVE this cage!!! It gives them tons of flying room. I also got one for my 2 cockateils and sun conure and they love it too!! The quality is excellent!! I highly recommend this cage :o) This is such a great cage! I have a cockatiel and I had been housing her in a cockatoo cage that I happened to have on hand up until I purchased this cage, and while it worked ok, it really wasn't species appropriate for her. The bars were very thick and she just couldn't get around as easily as I wanted her to be able to which also caused issues with her slipping and falling and damaging her tail feathers. The bowls for it also weren't working out. They were so large her tail was always soaked with water. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if it wasn't for a few things: So far, so good. Took us a few minutes to figure out how it put together, but it's pretty easy once you get the base. I went over it with my hands and eyes and looked for flaws, and I didn't see anything. I was doubting getting this cage after reading a few reviews that weren't too good, but I just took the risk. I don't regret it. I can't wait to get my 2 parakeets in here, I think they'll LOVE it! I love this cage! My sparrow loves it even more! The cage is large, sturdy, and really well made. I am so happy with the purchase. I love the four food/water containers that came with it, as well as the 3 wooden perches. Someone used this cage, returned it and then it was resold to us. The floor of the cage is still stained with bird poo, it came without instructions and seems to be missing pieces. The seller simply resold it without inspecting it. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time and money. I read so many reviews on this and decided to give it a try and now I am returning it. Multiple welds are broken, two of the screws won't go in (they don't even fit the size of the hole it's supposed to go in. The spring doors on the sides don't latch in any way so any animal (bird, mouse, sugar glider, etc) can easily push them open and escape! Thankfully I ordered via Amazon prime so return and refund is easy. ", "Terrible shipping experience was just the tip of the iceberg, but I guess I can't talk about that since my previous review \"couldn't be posted in its current form\". I should have known better than to purchase a cage online. I should have just saved up and bought a Double Critter Nation, Congo, or Brisbane. I know this is a bird cage, but since they really don't make any cages specifically for sugar gliders, I was hoping to get a decent cage at a decent price, since I'm a disabled veteran living on a fixed income. This cage is quite flimsy, shouldn't have passed quality control, and will no doubt need replaced in a few months! There's a pretty large gap between the slide out grate and the bottom of the cage. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but since the grate is very cheaply made (cheaper than a knock off Brisbane that I own. I was buying this cage to replace it because of the rust after close to two years of owning), it flexes with the least bit of pressure. There was only one bent bar, but nothing that can't be fixed. One of the side, spring-loaded doors, doesn't work properly and will stay open, when pushed open. This really doesn't matter much because I've zip tied them all closed, since sugar gliders would definitely be able to open them. Another one of the side doors, the long, straight part of the spring, meant to give resistance, broke free, causing the paint to chip down to bare metal. This will surely rust quickly! One of the front doors, was so tight around the bar is supposed to swing freely from, that simply opening it, caused paint to scrape off, to the bare metal. Another spot that will rust quickly! There are a few spots on the cage that the paint was scraped off, straight out of the box. The drop pan is the worst quality I've ever seen! It's so flexible, when barely resting my arm on it, while trying to zip tie my floor stand of my sugar gliders wheel to the bottom grate, it bent so much that it fell out of the rails it's meant to slide in and out of. This definitely takes 2 people to put together. I will update with pics later, it's been pretty much an all day affair between finding the missing package that was supposed to be here yesterday, putting it together, and getting it ready for my sugar gliders. I need to use my other phone to take good pics so you can see the issues I'm talking about. Great cage for smaller breeds of parrots -- Cockatiels, Budgies, etc. Bigger breeds could possibly bend some of the bars or potentially open up the cage, so I'd avoid it for anything bigger/stronger. I got it for half the Price on Amazon that I've ever seen the identical model in-stores. $90 vs $180), so while it definitely has its flaws, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I'm going to reiterate what many past reviewers have stated, but I have to give credit where credit is due. This cage has lived up to my expectations. I had been searching to find a spacious, efficient, well-built cage for a good price. After a lot of researching, this was the best cage I found for its price regarding material (sturdy wrought iron), size (internally 23\" depth, 37\" across, 47\" high), and design (easy to clean, move, and access). I know several past reviewers have mentioned that it came with damaged or missing parts, but I believe that Prevue has resolved this. This cage came extremely secure and well-packaged, with all parts present and intact. I found that the instructions, one double-sided page with pictures, are pretty simple and straightforward. If you can tell which parts are which and you have a helping hand to hold them together, it shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes to assemble this. 5 stars for loving the cage design after assembling and 5 budgies love it also. Flexibility of door sizes and location, see excellent, I use brown craft paper, 55lb from bulk roll ordered from amazon, most economical so I can change paper daily, like the pull our tray easy to clean w disinfectant wipes and it slides back in under the wired bottom so birds can't touch it anyway. The craft paper is on top of the bottom wired shelf so they can run around easily without tearing or sagging, their feet aren't on the grill bottom this way, nice and smooth. To simply say that this cage was defective  and poorly crafted would be insufficient. Yes, it came with two broken dishes, and several parts were bent. Some of the holes were poorly drilled or drilled at an angle or not drilled at all. However, it was the AGONY involved in putting this cage together that is the crux of my 1-star review.  Had I attempted to assemble this cage before it was past the return window, it would've gone right back in the box to China. Honestly, as a parent who has put together numerous and impossibly intricate toys the night before Christmas, I have never quite experienced the misery involved with putting this cage together. My helper got so frustrated less than half way through, that she quit and stormed off cursing the cage and those who fabricated its pieces.  Four hours later, I completed it alone, but only after creatively devising fasteners that would grasp the angled drill holes, frantically emptying my tool box over the floor desperately seeking just the right tool or screw that would make it all come together, and getting out my electric drill to make holes where there were none. And so many times, that glimmer of hope - when all the bars and screw holes on one side of the cage were finally aligned - was suddenly dashed when I realized the bars and holes on the opposite side had unaligned themselves because the part was bowed. As a final blow, the two of the four dishes that were not broken, didn't fit the bar spacing. The only consolation I have for buying this cage is that my canaries seem to like it, and what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. The cage is decent, seems sturdy, however LET THIS BE A WARNING TO ANYONE ABOUT TO BUY: There were multiple spots on the cage bars where there was very, very sharp metal sticking out. I had to use a file and pliers to dull the metal enough that it wouldn\u2019t rip my cockatiels feet open when he was climbing (I have cuts and punctures). Quality control needs to step up because it was nonexistent on mine. 2 of the cups came broke (as expected) and the spring nonsense on all those side doors needs replaced. If you dont want to use the grate and have a small bird (like me) you can put the tray inside the cage and slide it down to the bottom. Its actually more secure this way as it kept falling out of the track anyway and there is no gap at all for the bird to get stuck in or for things to fall out. I bought this extra large cage for my two cockatiels so they could have some more space to play while I am working. It is now their full time cage because we love it so much! Super-fast shipping! All pieces were included, no damage, took me about 30 minutes to put it together by myself--very easy. Great quality cage, my 3 parakeets love it! Easy to clean. I like that there are two big doors on the front, one at the top and one at the bottom. Makes it very easy to access their food, switch out their toys, and clean. I took away a star because I don't understand why all the little doors on the sides aren't secure like the big ones on the front. I had to bend paper clips to hold the doors shut, since they open out from the cage and my birds would easily escape. Still, this big cage was much less expensive than the smaller one I purchased at the big chain pet store. Great value, good product, happy birds! I got this as a cage upgrade for my green cheek conure. For the price, it is an incredibly large cage. I like having the two doors to easily clean the cage and move around perches and toys. The assembly was definitely a two-person job, but it didn't take much physical strength or any special tools. Some of the panels were slightly bent when they arrived, as other people had said. The assembly process bent it straight again, other than a few slightly bent individual bars. I had to secure the spring-loaded side doors I wasn't using with zip ties and used clips on her food and water doors, as she could easily escape by just pushing those open. Not sure why then included such an easy locking mechanism on the large doors but nothing on the side doors. Regardless, this is by far the best cage I could get for her for the price, and I'm really happy with it. I would rather get her this and let her have room to fly and climb all over the place than get her a smaller cage from a more reputable seller that didn't have issues with bending or had better locks, as those are easy problems to fix. None ", "After having this cage for quite some time, I can attest that my society finches adore this cage. It is literally an aviary for them and they love to flit about. It is easy to clean and the doors provide excellent access for food, water, nesting stuff, toys, millet spray, and baths...or whatever else you put in your birds cage (mine are spoiled so...). Assembly took about an hour (2 person job, limited space to move around) and it's pretty sturdy. Rolls really well and the storage is handy, though the compartment isn't very large underneath. I would definitely recommend this cage to anyone that has birds that are parakeet sized or smaller. It is NOT for larger birds as their intelligence and bite strength would render the spring loaded doors useless. It's a huge, beautiful cage. Easy to put together, but definitely need two people. My budgies are in awe over the size and jumping all over with excitement. It was sweet to see how happy they were to be in it. BUT.... Two out of three food trays are useless because one of the hooks on each of them didn't fully form so they won't hook to the cage. Another thing I noticed, and this probably just part of having such a large, tall cage.... But hanging toys is difficult. I've had to put all their toys on chain links to bring them lower so my birds can reach them. But, all in all the cage is beautiful, spacious and worth the money. They do need to replace my food trays though. : ) I took off one star for the food dishes. Those should have been inspected by quality control and never been allowed to be sent out like that. I haven't had a bird in a long time,  but my dog, cat and I decided that it was time for the trifecta. I decided on an English budgie. I had heard from everybody that you should get the largest cage possible and athough I just got one bird (but I might get another one after Sydney has bonded with me), I decided on this Prevue Pet flight cage. I am thrilled that I did! It was easy to put together by myself and I am a 66 year old woman. I love the fact that the two doors on the front are absolutely huge and allow access to pretty much the whole inside of the cage. Also, the three doors on each side of the cage (6 in total) allow access to reach anywhere on the back wall of the cage to place toys or perches or millet. I took the two feeding stations and put them side-by-side on the back of the cage, which makes for a kind of a buffet for Sydney -very easy to reach from the side doors and I just like the fact that it was in the back for some reason. I like the look and I like the way that I can have toys hanging on either side of it. The cage bottom grid and the cage bottom plastic tray are easily reachable and fine. There is a little shelf under that which is toward the bottom of the cage (you can see that in the photograph) and you can either find a plastic container that fits it almost exactly at Ikea or Home Depot or you can split up your bird items into very colorful shoebox kind of containers that are super cheap at Michaels. The shoe box containers have little slots on the front of the boxes that you can mark what is in the box. So I have millet in an airtight bag and I put that in one box and I have extra toys in another... you get the idea. Some people might think that this cage is an overkill for one budgie, but I don't think it is. It looks great and there are toys that Sydney loves like the rope & wood bridge that I can hook up diagonally on the sides of the cage. Anyway, I can't think of anything I don't like about it. Oh! I did want to mention that my cat, Oliver Wendell, likes to sleep on top of the cage so my idea was to get a piece of plastic or lucite or something and cut it down so that Oliver's paws wouldn't go through the wires.  I found that the plastic was a lot more expensive than I wanted to spend, so I found a wonderful solution. At Home Depot where they sell outdoor welcome mats they have rolls of vinyl runner material that is about $2.40 a foot. I bought three feet of a semi-clear/slightly frosted vinyl and trimmed it down to fit the cage top.  It's perfect!!  I will be building a homemade play gym for Sydney and the mat will be easy to clean.  Enjoy your birds!!! I purchased this cage for my 5 budgies as my heavy duty cage they were living in did not fit through the doorway of my new home. This cage does the job for now but there are some very large gaps between the frame and the first bar in the panel. This gap could cause issues with smaller birds, which is obviously what this cage is made for based on the fact there are no fastenings of any kind to keep the side doors closed. It relies entirely on 1 spring. A medium or larger bird could definitely figure out how to get out. This makes the gaps even more questionable as it creates a potentially dangerous bar spacing issue. There's also a large gap at the bottom of the cage where the bottom panel meets the last bar of the side panels. The bottom tray of mine keeps popping out and creating another gap, but this one only allows bird poop to escape onto the bottom shelf. Several of the panels also came with bent bars, which shows the material of the cage isn't very strong and could potentially be broken off by even a medium sized bird. I do like the fact that it has a shelf on the bottom for storage. This cage is most likely okay for smaller birds, and it'll make due until I can move somewhere I can go back to their better constructed cage. Their other cage is 30\u00d730, and the inside space is similar. It has a slide lock on all the access panels and an actual lock on the front. This one only had a bar you lift up on the main doors, much like smaller cages. I actually paid less for my nicer cage at the time. I feel like this cage is overpriced for how poor the construction of it is. The bars are thin and bent, the large gaps between the panels. These are markers of an inferior product. So,  I have a single very spoiled parakeet. I bought this aviary cage for Angel as an upgrade from the Haggen Vision L - Long, which I loved because it was so easy to clean. Let's face it my gymnast jungle chicken needed more room! This cage is more than double the size. I like the ball casters ( wheels) and the large front doors. I have an issue with the side doors however. The side doors can be pushed from the inside, meaning you can just pull on the door at it will open. They are also spring mounted - so I would be worried that a bird could push on the door enough to squeeze through or worse get stuck and strangle. I have the doors zip tied shut for now but I will be using metal clips as soon as I have them to \"lock\" the doors.  If the doors opened inward or had a latch this would not be a problem. I decided not to use the bottom grate, as Angel likes to run around on the cage bottom. I put the tray in the top slot, and there is a slight gap there, so I use a couple small clamps to hold it tight to the bottom of the cage frame. I have seen budgies squeeze through some very small places if they want to bad enough.  Overall I think it's a good deal for the money and quick delivery via Amazon is always a plus. I would get the add on cover, as it covers the whole cage. Prevue don't go up in price because this cage is already on the high end pricing.  With that being said it is a great home for cockateils/multiple cockateils/Quakers/multiple parakeets etc.. Roomy; light weight; easy to wipe down & clean; rollers make it easy to move to clean the floor(birds have no manners in regards to that, lol).  Just don't increase the price because it is not made like the heavy quality bird cages. All in all it works for us. I had purchased two and my cockateils all went in one, so I adopted two Quakers for the other.  Nice clean look in my bird room. None We absolutely LOVE this flight cage for our pair of Bourke\u2019s parakeets. My handy husband easily assembled it in 45 minutes. The rolling casters are fantastic and make it easier to move the cage to clean under and around it. That said, I wish this cage came with angled seed guard panels, as some other cages do, because it does not contain the mess at all. At the least, the manufacturer should pair it with a mesh seed skirt that fits it. There may be one available but I haven\u2019t been able to find it. Anyway, back to the positives, my sweet little birds are very happy in their home. I loved that it came with three wooden dowels, although parakeets like to fly side-to-side, so I replaced two of the perches with shorter ones that go across the short dimension of the cage. I also love that the cage came with four double seed dishes. They are terrific. I put in my own stainless steel water bowl and lots of toys. Happy birds, happy owner. Highly recommend. Edited after dealing with customer service. I have 26 small to medium size Parrots. whenever I need a new cage, or toys or sundecks, I always look for the Pet Preview name. Very good quality! My birds love to have the room to fly in their cage. All of my birds are rescued and have some kind of problem, that makes it so no one wants to adopt them. But to me, they are all beautiful! The cages you offer make the lives, of these misfit birds, very wonderful. thank you, so very much for offering the type of items that you do. Carol. update, Just received my 3rd cage from Prevue Hendryx, and put it together by myself. It helped me to use zip ties,( not tight ), to  hold the bottom parts together before putting the bolts in. Quality is very good and the birds, I put in it, liked all the space. THANK YOU AGAIN! ", "Overall, I'm really happy. I use this for my budgie and he loves it, he has plenty of room to fly and play with his many toys. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge, but considering I've never put together any furniture before and I'm a 5'4\" tall girl, it was fairly easy. However, I'd recommend a step stool for putting together the top portion. My was also a little bent, but some pliers fixed the worst of it. I bought this cage several months ago and it looks great and is easy to clean. I've put together so many cages in my life that I can do it with my eyes closed- not this one. Not only was it horrendous to assemble, but pieces were bent requiring a hammer to straighten- but the biggest issue is that the two HOLES WERE MISSING in the top left side panel to screw the other half on the top on. I ended up zip-tying the entire top and reinforced wiggly areas. The only reason I'm not sending it back is because of the hassle of disassembling and mailing it- prime or not. I was so excited for this cage to come in! This cage was a royal pain in the tushie to assemble. Several of the pegs were misaligned with the holes and required bending with pliers and the holes for the screws were of inconsistent size. It took two people over an hour to get the silly thing together, and half of it was trying to hold everything in alignment so we could get the screws in place. I use this cage for my Diamond Doves. I have four of them and this cage is spacious enough for them to get exercise in while I'm away for the day. However, this cage isn't necessarily for ground feeders like doves. You can't ground feed with the wire rack installed. With only the bottom tray in, without the bottom wire rack, there is too much room and small birds could potentially escape. So I left the wire rack in, and just placed butcher paper on top of the wire. My birds seem to be happy with that. I loved this cage, for the first few weeks. Then it started to sway. The bolts became loose. I'd tighten them but they'd loosen if I barely touched the cage. Today, when I went to bring him out, I saw it had completely fell apart. The metal warped and rusted. The bottom dropped out. Its unfixable. I'm pretty pissed off, and I spent a good part of the morning swearing. My poor bird could have escaped and flown into our ceiling fan! I tried for hours to fix it and its impossible. I have literally had this for less than a year. I want a refund!! My bird has to live in his bad back up cage now. I can't express my anger enough. Oh and checking reviews, it seems alot have had this issue. Faulty product that can lead to an escaped or injured bird!! I'm giving this product a 4 stars, only because the first time it was sent to me it had 3 of the same pieces when I only need two, so that made a two piece part, 1 short. Anyway, they sent me a replacement with 2 day shipping and it came great, none of the bowls were broken either which was a plus because in the previous one they sent. Two bowls were broken but I didn't really care because I already have my own feeding bowls, it was easy to set up. I only need some assistance one time and that was to screw in a piece. Some of the pieces don't match up very well, you have to kind of bend them and work it around but over all this is a great looking cage, very simple. And my birds are adjusting well! Thank you! Welp, here's how this went. I really cannot say enough good things about this moderately priced, very roomy cage for small-to-medium sized birds.  I've wanted a flight cage for my cockatiel for a very long time and this cage is just great.  It arrived with a careful and accurate inventory of all pieces, the instructions for assembly were very, very good, and while it suggests having two people available to assemble, I (5ft tall female) was able to accomplish it all by myself in about an hour.  All doors are in good working order. all bars 1/2\" spaced and entire surface a light powder-coat finish that is entirely smooth and safe for my bird.  My cockatiel loves his new home.  He loved having the space to adequately stretch his wings (spent nearly the first two days doing little else), and now feels he has the space to splash in a bath.  All of these behaviors were repressed in his much smaller (but standard cockatiel-sized cage).  I absolutely recommend this cage as an economical option for any small-medium sized bird owner who loves their feathered baby and wants them to have the best option for safe and healthy and happy accommodations. EDIT: my sun conure approved too. It's a really good cage. Despite bars being vertical she manages climbing very easily as there's horizontal bars often enough for her to grab with her beak. She loves to play on top of the cage running around on it or playing in the little play top I sometimes put there. She has figured out the doors in two days, but I use dog leash stainless steel hooks so she can't escape. She doesn't try either, she was just playing with the doors as a puzzle. The cage is big enough for a conure, and she's out in the morning and at night. She seems to like her home. Every time she goes back to the cage she seems to say hello to it by doing the greeting stretch they do. ", "I have 10 zebra finches and eventually want to make or buy a furniture/wooden style aviary but am currently in an apartment so this is fine in the meantime. I was weary about getting this cage after reading the reviews. My biggest concern was that it would be extremely difficult to put together, but it isn't. The directions are not that clear, and the pieces are not labeled, but I put this together in less than an hour. I did have my (disabled) husband hold a few pieces in place while I worked. I would recommend that you have someone to help you as it is easier to align everything, but it can be done by one person. As far as the finish - it looks great - kind of a black and silver hammered finish. It is sturdy enough for my small parrot and I had no trouble with the bottom pan falling or not fitting, it fit right in and stayed there. I am not a fan of the spring loaded doors on the sides, my Quaker Parrot figured those out pretty quickly (within a few hours) so I just put some hair clips on them for now to keep them shut. I'm glad I went with this cage, especially after the price drop to $89.99 Prime, this cage is huge, and you wouldn't be able to get something this size in a pet shop for under $300.00. The only reason that I am giving four stars and not five is that I personally think that those doors are a terrible option and the large front doors could latch down better. Be a bit careful or use some clips if you have an escape artist like I do. So this review is from the perspective of a person who is using this cage for rats. None I purchased this item to use for my 2 y/o iguana to hang outside with us on the patio. It took 2 of us to put together and my husband is pretty handy- just an awkward, unbalanced puzzle until you can get the screws in. We had to bend the panels straight again. They were slightly bent (possibly in shipping) but just put a knee in the center and it'll work. Not sure what that says about the sturdiness. I had to assemble two of these beasts after moving into a new house so we could easily transfer our birds to new, clean cages. This cage was recommended to me. Now, I should preface this by saying that they do earn an extra star for being semi-functional after the torturous assembly process. I bought this as a cage upgrade for my three sugar gliders. This is an amazing cage that offers a lot of open space, which is perfect for sugar gliders or other small climbing animals. The locking doors and tight bars have ensured no late night escapes. We did tuck the small spring-hinged doors on the sides in to reduce chances of them being pushed open, but I personally find them too small/inconvenient to have used regardless. My one criticism would be that the front doors could also be bigger to make reaching in and adjusting cage accessories/interacting with your pets easier. Pros:  My 5 zebra  finches love the cage, it gives them lots of flying room and room to get away from each other.  It is easier to clean but there are some downsides to that, see below. This cage is exactly as advertised. It arrived in excellent condition with all the parts and pieces. The feeding and water trays are made of hard plastic and all were intact. I would highly recommend having two people to put this together. It took two of us about 45 minutes to assemble, but I think it would have been frustrating to attempt it alone. If the parts were labeled, it would make it a little easier, but it's not too hard if you take your time and look at the pictures. We took the advice of another reviewer and did not fully tighten all the screws until completed. There were a couple bent rails but they were easily shaped back into place and did not compromise the value or integrity of the cage. I read a review that said there were sharp pieces that injured a bird. This concerned me and I inspected my cage thoroughly. The only somewhat sharp parts I found were on the spring hinges of each small side door. It would be a fluke for the bird to fly close enough to these areas, but I didn't want to take a chance so I put a little piece of black electrical tape over them (pictured) just to be extra safe. There are two large doors on the front of the cage that can be left open if you want your birds to fly in and out. I saw this exact same cage advertised with a pet store chain for three times the price. I think my parakeet is going to love his new home. I have provided a picture of his old cage to compare size. In my opinion this cage is suitable for small birds only. It's a great value and definitely an improved quality of life for our fine feathered friends. So the positive is the cage is steady and super large for all my conure's toys and needs to explore. For an inside cage this large, you can't really beat the price. ", "Wow, I'm really impressed with this cage!  It arrived in a big square box, quite heavy (for me)...of course it had the Made in China stamp on the box, which made me wonder if it was going to be a piece of crap. On the contrary, this is a GREAT cage...sturdy...heavy enough that my cats cannot get at my finches and canaries. Instead of the perches included, I got branches off my apple tree and made a really cool natural looking habitat for my birds, complete with toys like mirrors, etc.  There were four double feeding bowls. All the parts to the cage were made very well, and had some weight to them. My 16 yr old son put the whole thing together within a half hour and just needed me to hold the first two pieces together until he could put the base on...they he was able to do the rest without help. Screws were easy to put in, everything matched up. I have no complaints, and all I can say is that this was very much worth the money. Happy with my purchase!! Received the flight cage and it came with a wrong base piece. I had to write the manufacturer to get the correct piece. After almost 2 weeks, I received the correct base and was able to assemble it. I assembled it myself but it would have been easier with 2 people. This cage is really big and the my tiny finches are enjoying it very much. I like that it is on wheels, making it easy to clean around it, that it has a storage shelf to store their food and I like all of the doors, especially the big ones because it is easier to get inside to clean. The company is easy to work with to get the correct pieces but I was annoyed that the box didn't have all of the correct parts. I'm glad that I didn't need it right away and could wait for the correct part. It is a sturdy cage that is easy to clean. I'm glad to have it. This was flimsy from the moment I put it together.  The tray on the bottom doesn't fit the slots, so it's not usable.  Every time I clean it out, I have to have someone hold it back in place while I pile books and magazines underneath it just to keep it from collapsing.  It was a complete waste of money; there's far better quality cages for lower prices. This is a pretty big cage. It's not super difficult to put together but it does take several minutes to figure out all the side panels and match up the instruction pictures. It took me and my boyfriend about 45 mins or so to put it together. There were no missing pieces, just the top of the cage was slightly bent on one bar near the front but it's not noticeable. Great for the price. My tiels (I have 3) seem very happy and relaxed, and I enjoy that it has many doors for me to get to things in a pinch. It is crazy easy to clean, and the roll weels are easy to manage but not so loose that it jiggles around. My caique broke the welds off of some of the wires from this cage.. def not safe for anything larger than a cockatiel. Before I even bought this my avian vet ok\u2019d the dimensions, bar spacing and bar width.  I\u2019d return this but I threw out the packaging. She\u2019s a rescue and legit ripping this cage apart. Side doors should come with locks. Should not be advertised for small/medium parrots. Total garbage for anything larger than lovebirds, cockatiels or finches. \ud83d\udcab  You just can\u2019t find a large cage with the proper space between bars for sm/med birds in the heavier duty cages ,especially for this amazing price\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Package was late by 3 days, which I couldn't understand since it was sitting in a warehouse just about an hour away from me. After reading reviews about Ontrac I was really worried I wouldn't get it at all. I needed a cage pretty bad as I rescued a finch from a very bad situation so I ended up having to go to Petsmart and spent roughly $250 on another cage. It finally showed up in a box that was beat up and ripped and honestly I feared the worst about how the contents held up. To be honest my original plan was to send it back, since I already had the $250 cage from Petsmart but curiosity got the best of me and I decided to set it up. The reason I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to manipulate one piece with a hammer to make the cage fit together.I was able to assemble the cage by myself. It took about 2 hours, It would have been easier with a helper. Let me start out by saying that I purchased the XL cage! After reading the reviews I thought that it was going to be a nightmare to assemble. It wasn\u2019t. 6 Months pregnant and I was able to put it together by myself in under 30 minutes. The only issue I had with assembly, was that the parts aren\u2019t labeled. They\u2019re labeled on the instruction sheet, just not on the actual product pieces. That was honestly my main issue with it as a whole. A few of the bars were bent, and it was addressed in the instructions that it happens during shipping. But, I personally feel that it could have been packaged with more protection to avoid the bent bars issue. Another thing I noticed a lot of people complaining about, was the spring loaded doors being pushed outwards. I personally flipped the pieces so that the doors opened to the inside and it made a world of difference! It also eliminated any sharp pieces from the springs being on the inside. I totally recommend flipping the panels. Overall it\u2019s a very nice cage for a very inexpensive price! ", "I ordered this for my budgie, and he loves how much space there is. I need to go shopping for more toys since it looks so bare now! Cage came with plenty of screws, all of which went in with no problems (I had 1 extra) and complaints of bent bars didn't bother me (come on people, use pliers/your fingers and just fix it. With the way they package it in its box, it's going to happen sometimes in transport). Mine had a couple MINOR cosmetic bends here and there that I fixed in 2 seconds. Assembly went smoothly for me, and though you CAN do it alone, having at least 1 other person makes it go way faster. Once assembled, it's plenty sturdy and the wheels are nice. nice roomy cage that will be used for finches.  Light gauge wire and spring loaded side doors make this iffy for parrot types including keets.  Doors would need snaps or some type of secured latch.  No attached bottom, just the wire slide and the plastic tray, so need to make double sure both are not out at the same time.  A few spots had some larger gaps but nothing major.  Lots of room for small birds to fly and roomy enough for real branches.  *Absolutely* needs 2 people to put it together and at least one of you need to have enough patience to keep the other from melting down ;-)  Instructions are actually pretty decent, and you have to take your time to carefully hold things together while the other person screws.  Everything fit together well.  It took the 2 of us less than an hour to assemble. UPDATED REVIEW: I still love the space of this cage but for the price I expected quality to be better. Less than 5 months of putting our 2 cockatiels in this cage and the horizontal bars that are welded to vertical bar are now breaking the welds she the cars move freely and cause harm to my birds. I'm having to zip tie many of these until I can save up for a better quality cage. PLEASE CHECK THE BARS REGULARLY!!! The cage had a bent piece when it arrived.  No worries, I contacted them and they replaced the part. UPDATE: Love the cage, the two parakeets STILL (11/24/18) love it too.  Plenty of room.  Also, the three perches that came with it are fine for their little \"feet\".  I found that the tabs holding the plastic trays that come with it to the inside of the cage don't last long - rather than ask for new ones, I have a drill...put a hole under the tabs which broke off and I can use twine or something safe to TIE them to the cage...works just fine! This is a great cage for the price. Its sturdy and looks great in my house. It was moderately smooth to put together and took about 30 minutes. It is super easy to clean and the plastic tray is sturdy. Purchased this cage for a new Budgie (Parakeet). Shipping was very fast! It took my dad and I about an hour to get it put together correctly. You will need at least two people but it isn't impossible to do it by yourself. Just lay everything out with the doors facing the correct way. I did not need to use any zip-ties. The tray at the bottom pulls out nicely without any issues. Its a MANSION for 1 budgie but I could see 3 living comfortably with toys, coconut huts, water/food dishes and plenty of fun ways to get around. **I know our budgie is going to LOVE his new Crib!** I\u2019ve bought this flight cage for my two new parakeets, and just received it yesterday. I researched enough to know that I should stick with 1/2-inch bar width and get the biggest cage I can. This fits the bill! The large is huge for parakeets, plenty of room for toys and flight. It was remarkably easy to assemble, even though I did it myself. Tip: use the box to get started because it helps hold the legs upright while you attach the first screws. Cage comes with three cage-width perches and four large food/water dishes, which wasn\u2019t super prominent in the description. I do wish the wheels locked. **Maybe the manufacturers will see that.** Overall, it\u2019s exactly what I expected, at a reasonable price, and it seems solid. I hope my new birds love it! I was on the fence about purchasing this cage for my Amazon Parrot since many of the reviews say its not built all that strong. I must say it has held up to my bird rather well. The spring returns for the small side doors are very easily opened by larger birds like my amazon and thus may need to be fastened with something stronger for other large birds. The cage comes with 3 perches, 4 food  bowls, and no easy directions. The food bowls do not slide into the cage spacing but generally need to have some force added to get them properly seated. The perches are also not large enough in diameter for my amazon to stand comfortably, so either compensate by adding various larger perches around the cage or completely changing out all perches. I was annoyed by the lack of directions but once the pieces are all laid out in front of you and you take a look at photos of the cage it will come together. The cage is not built to withstand too much stress but it handles my parrot biting the bars and playing around rather well. Be sure that when you put it together all the bar ends go in the holes in the receiving bars, if not it will create a hazard to your bird and they will eventually get hurt by it. Seeing as when i purchased the cage there was only other review for someone who used this as an amazon cage I'm glad I tried it out. The bar spacing is not too small for my particular parrot but, be sure to research for your bird so they don't hurt their feet. I very much like the rack under the cage where I can store various supplies and food for my bird. I do recommend getting a play stand for the top of the cage so your bird can come out of his territory and feel more neutral to be played with, the top will be able to hold a decent amount of weight (5ish pounds) without sagging. I have not tested that over time but it currently does not have problems. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll get you the best answer I can! ", "Great pricing, free shipping, arrived in excellent shape, nothing bent or broken, I bought mine for sugar gliders, and it is perfect for them. Easy peasy to slide out and clean the tray, enough access doors for checking sleeping pouches and hanging the food dishes, bars are spaced for these little fliers. Doors are big enough to easily pull out the exercise wheels and their toys. Prevue Co. has been a favorite for 50 years, my first job 50 years ago was at a pet store so I do know which manufacturers have good products. I do recommend 2 people to put it together, the sections aren't marked and you need to be sure you can open all doors OUTWARD before you tighten everything. A screwdriver and a heavy pair of needlenose  pliers are all the tools required. The box has a pic of the cage and if you look at that, you can easily put it together. Within 2  hours of starting to work on it, it was together, I had it set up with litter, pouches, hammocks, food and the sugar gliders. EXCELLENT flight cage! We purchased this exact same cage this past summer and love it!  I decided to purchase a second for my daughter as she loved the first cage for her budgie and is adding a conure!  Imagine her disappointment when we put together the cage and it is markedly smaller than the first cage even though we ordered the exact same cage months earlier via amazon and the box shares the same dimensions:(  We are none too happy and really I can't understand why this would happen, yet she doesn't want to wait for another one to be shipped and hope that it is larger because the dimensions on the box are the exact same as the first cage:(  I will add pictures later to show the discrepancy:( It's huge!! Many people complained it was difficult to assemble...I don't understand why? My kids and I assembled it without even looking at the instructions. It took us about 20 mins. Just pay attention to the location of the holes and pins...they prevent you to make a mistake. If you have to use a drill...well then, you made a mistake :). (Being 2 people or more helps) This is a great value- would not be suitable for large birds (not strong enough) but it fits my (small) conure perfectly. UPDATE four years Later! 6-5-2020: My beloved sunny has since passed away from old age and prior health conditions, and it was very easy to disinfect and clean the cage for when I later adopted a little Green Cheek. No rust, still as awesome as the day I got it, springs are all still working just fine on the doors, etc! My Dad (owner of this account) bought this for my two male budgies. While I adore the cage itself, it has alot of room for them to fly, room for toys, etc, I have a few problems with it. Okay, this cage was a bit of a pain to put together and a small piece of the bottom tray was broken off in the box,but that was quickly taken care of and made right by Amazon (Love their customer service!).  As stated, the cage was a pain to put together, but it is so work it! It has so much room for my two budgies and they absolutely love it. I do too! I like the wheels and how it can be moved as needed.  It is very sturdy once its together. The two large front doors are nice and the lock is sturdy. I did clip all of the side doors. Although I don't think a budgie would be able to put them open, we do have two cats and I didn't want to chance them being able to open it. I have a male canary, 2 female canaries, 3 society finches and 2 fancy zebra finches. They are loving the room and a happy family. There are plenty of side doors ( 2 on each side), that make access to water and food dishes easy, plus the 2 large doors on the front. It was a nightmare to put together. The direction's are not clear and you have to look at the picture of it assembled to help you out. My husband is not one to swear, but as he was assembling this he swore like a sailor! I have added a couple extra real wood perches. I am not thrilled with the food dishes, because food gets thrown all over the floor. I am looking for a better solution to that. But over all this is a great cage, it's roomy and once together, is easy to move around and get into to clean. I would recommend. Bf and I bought the cage for a joey sugar glider, the boxed arrived super fast (we ordered on Monday midnight and arrived by Thursday) even thought we live in PR, which is mostly considered as international shipping.  It was well packaged, and at first I thought it didn't have instructions to assembly, but it had. The cage is pretty strong and has lots of space for the sugar to move and climb but since she is still a joey my bf had to line it with a metal mesh. She loves the wood perches and also likes to be in the food trays (sometimes she even falls asleep there, so we move her to her house). It has 8 doors so you can access the cage from many sides. I love it so much, I bought it twice! ", "For the price, this is a very nice cage. I was looking for something larger to house my 3 society finches, but I didn\u2019t want to spend a ton. This fit the bill. Is it the best cage ever? No. Is it worth the money? Definitely. It\u2019s sturdy enough to do the job. I do wish there was more space between the bottom shelf and the cage, because it\u2019s really not large enough to store many items. I also don\u2019t love the spring style doors on the sides of the cage (the front doors are fine). They just don\u2019t seem very secure for a large bird, so something to be aware of. But since I just have small finches, it\u2019s not a huge problem. You will definitely need two people to put this cage together (it is actually helpful to have 3 - this worked best for me). The instructions are clear, and it\u2019s not rocket science. It took about 35 minutes to put together. Upon receiving the time, it has a few things missing.  Sticks, metal stopper and screw for slide out rack at bottom and 3-4 side smaller swing doors won\u2019t stay close. Springs are bad/defective or ? I have five of these cages now and they are an excellent product for the money. My canary and I both adore this cage!  I wanted my little guy to have a bigger cage so he has room to fly around, and he seems so content in here. He's been singing like crazy ever since he moved in to his new mansion.  The cage is pretty easy to build, and I was able to do it myself. Do  follow the directions with building the cage though, as there are several pieces and if you put the bottom on backwards, for example, the tray won't fit properly. The  instructions are very clear, though, and I had no trouble with it. What happened here? Did all the inspectors, in whatever factory in China these cages are made, all quit? The wire grid for the bottom was not complete and the dishes, that were included for use with this cage, do not fit! We had previously purchased two (2) of these cages and were satisfied with their quality. Come on guys. My flock of budgies absolutely LOVE this mansion!  They have plenty of room to fly, jump around, swing from toys, run up tall ladders for exercise, best home for them!  The feeding trays that come with the home are awesome as well.  I would recommend securing the small swing out doors on the sides of the bird house just in case, since there is no latch for them.  Easy thing to do.  There is plenty of room to reach in and remove anything in the house through the two big doors on the front of the house.  Highly recommend this bird house, and for the price it's a steal!  :-)  I know your bird(s) will LOVE it like my flock does! Great cage overall. As others have said assembling it a bit of pain. I put it together by myself using a few lose zip ties to hold it up so it is possible but very close attention to the front pieces with the doors, only one has the holes on the bottom so if you do it wrong you have to undo it and swap em which is what i had to do unfortunately! I assumed the pieces were all made the same so it wouldn't matter but yeah was not the case. So word to the wise if you put this together. Otherwise it's pretty great, comes with lots of plastic bowls not seen in the picture and of course the perches. Floor is wire but i put cardboard on it since in this case i'm housing a small rooster where wire floor is not ideal. :) I bought this cage for my Green Cheek Conure, he loves it! It wasn\u2019t that hard to put together (I did it by myself in under an hour) but some of the pieces did have to be a little bent back? Some of the pegs that slide into the pieces to connect them didn\u2019t line up or were already bent but I just grabbed some pliers. I bought it cause I wanted him to have more room for more toys and activities while I\u2019m at work, and it\u2019s big enough for him! It\u2019s probably big enough for a pair of GCCs or even larger suns. I did not like the plastic food cups it came with though, he has dumped them and tossed them off about 5 times in the last couple days but I\u2019ve ordered other ones and am temporarily using his bolted bath bowl as a water bowl and only putting a small amount of food in the cups to reduce the waste. And the side doors are only held by springs so he can push them super easy, so I clipped them shut (which I had to do with his old cage anyways). Other than that it looks like a good affordable large home for him :) even though some of the pieces seemed to be a little off in measurements, there\u2019s still not any gaps large enough for him to get out. The tray lock is a plus, he loves pushing the trays out and play with with the paper :/. He likes how the bottom is low enough to terrorize the dogs they the cage bars and when they try to eat his pellets. The directions kinda sucked but definitely not the worst ever instructions. Comparable to like ikea style. It would probably be easier to use 2 people than 1, but I don\u2019t work well with others and it always ends in arguments lol so I did it by myself. Not very hard at all. The box was smaller than what I was expecting. I have a PO Box but it fit in the back of my Chevy Spark with no problem. Uhhh what else? Bird loves it, so I love it! Decent enough large cage without breaking the bank. Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I absolutely love this cage. My parakeets are very happy with plenty of room. It comes with two long perches and 4 double food and water bowls. Putting it together is much easier and quicker with help. Cage is very sturdy and I expect that it will hold up for a long time to come. Cleaning the cage is not the easiest. It is a larger cage so that is to be expected. 5-Star item, satisfied customer. I purchased the regular large cage to have another big home for my birds. When I started on the base, I thought it would be too small for a flight cage. ", "I was super leery about ordering this after reading all of the reviews but I have to say I am 100% satisfied and happy that I bought it. This cage is fantastic for the price. It was very easy to put together. I had no issues and no bent pieces. It did come with cheap wood perches and plastic feeding cups, two of which were broken but it's not a big deal. The assembly instructions were pretty bad but I figured it out. My 5 year old helped hold the pieces together while I assembled. It's an excellent buy for small birds. The couple things i don't like is the wires on the cage are vertical not horizontal and the side openings are spring loaded which i remedied with a few clothes pins. Overall it was worth it with the sheer size of the cage. Love this cage have an Indian Ringneck that is rescue and as you can see the smaller cages what she was in. In this cage she has lots room she is extremely happy! I've had the cage now for a few months and I'm so glad that I bought this one. Of course I did take the bottom grate out and move the tray to where the great was I'm not a fan of grates on the bottom and had seen for where another customer had done the same thing and it works out wonderful. I would highly recommend this cage. I found it very easy to put together. I was watching a movie and putting it together at the same time so it took about an hour. But I don't think I would put anything larger than possibly an Indian Ringneck in it I wouldn't go for any larger parrot. This cage is a good size and sturdy, but horribly made without precision.  The parts do now go where they should, wires were bent up upon arrival with some welds broken, leaving large gaps.  JB Weld was a good fix.  Buy it before you even receive your cage.  Also you need a hammer, pliers and 5 hours with lots of patience.  Throw away the wire door locks & devise your own.  The plastic food/water containers' grips don't fit thru the wire spaces, so throw them away. This is a great product. At this price point ($99 and free shipping), you will not find a better flight cage. It was well packaged, including corner supports/protectors, easy to unbox, and all parts were separately wrapped in plastic. The instructions were concise and easily understandable. I put this cage together by myself in less than 30 minutes. There were no missing or damaged parts. The front of the cage is attached last which allows you to place perches, feeding dishes, toys and arrange the interior to your liking without having to reach through doors and such. Once your interior decorating is complete you simply attach the front. I have three parakeets in it now with plenty of room and could probably add three more comfortably. Be forewarned though that this cage is not suitable for large, strong birds. A Macaw could destroy it easily, I suspect. But for parakeets, canaries and finches and such, it's perfect. I do take issue with the spring loaded doors on the side. For the sake of safety, I recommend you engineer a way to secure them. I did not remove a star since that issue is easily remedied if one chooses. Easy to assemble - did it alone as I had no helper. The x-large is really huge. Arrived well packaged and in sturdy box with bumpers on all corners. Getting the box inside was the hardest part it\u2019s very heavy and awkward. Beautiful build. Will be using for canaries and parakeets but I think it would house anything up to and including an Indian ringneck if you fastened down the size spring doors. The two front doors are big enough to admit a good sized conure orvIRN and it\u2019s sturdy. Would never put an amazon or grey in it they would just bend the bars. This is just a huge bargain and I appreciate that it\u2019s not overly heavy to move about. Great Great Great. Love it! We purchased this for Quinn after adopting our husky mix. He enjoys flying around but since we got her we don\u2019t risk them in the same room without supervision. When he is out they are in separate rooms as-like any husky-she takes a little too much interest. He has so much space! The smaller sized one with the wheels makes it easy to roll into and out of the closet when we move him from his bedtime cage to this-the play time one. Assembly was a little difficult due to manufacture blemishes. There was one hole with a large metal bump inside that hadn\u2019t been filed down during manufacture. It made it impossible to put the back piece in the hole. Thankfully I had a spare knife sharpener that did the trick. My Quinn approves so it was worth it! He is quite thoroughly spoiled with this. I\u2019d definitely use it for birds like parakeets, cockatiels, canaries, and finches. Maybe parrotlets too but anything larger such as a conure may be able to chew through the bars if they really put their mind to it. The sliding tray makes cleaning easy along with the double doors, and the extra slot below that has been great for storing food, toys, and newspapers. All in all it\u2019s great! After reading reviews for this product, I made the purchase expecting to spend hours putting it together. I also expected missing or broken pieces. Not only were all of the pieces in perfect condition, the entire cage only took me 30 minutes to put together. The instructions were easy to follow, despite the parts not being labelled. You have to look at the pictures on the instructions to figure out which pieces go where, but this is DEFINITELY worth the money. I have a Plum Headed Parrot, and he loves it! I wouldn't recommend this for large parrots, as their beaks are likely strong enough to bite through, or bend, the thin bars. However, this cage is PERFECT for small to medium sized birds. My birds seem to like their new home, personally I love it, for the price it is strong, durable and huge compared to the one we upgraded from, they spent the first 3 days literally in one spot and didn't move until they realized there were other dishes in there with food and treats... I absolutely love this cage, It is huge, my boys can easily fly back and forth together and they have lots of room to separate if they are moody, as for the ease of putting it together....SO EASY I did it myself, I was worried because I read others reviews on it saying they had trouble, but please don't let that discourage you from buying, I don't understand their complaint because all the sections are clearly different so if you just follow the instructions..even just the pictures you can do it...and I did it all myself..only took me about 45 minutes...we are so happy with it...in the first picture you can see the smaller flight cage my two boys were in which I know was sufficient but this one is sooooo much more roomy ...hope I have helped you decide to buy ....happy chirping :) ", "The parts on the instructions are labeled L1 L2 R1 R2 etc. The problem is, is the parts themselves are not labeled at all (if they are it's extremely poorly). Seriously, at least IKEA has that part down. This company? NOPE. The packages which the parts came in were not labeled either. Which wouldn't have mattered anyhow since some of them were outside of the plastic. Like the employee that put the parts together in the box just simply could not be bothered with the extra step. The instruction paper gives a description on what each part looks like. Sounds acceptable right? NOPE again! Each part is literally identical to it's counterpart if you were to flip it to the other side. Making their descriptions completely worthless. My budgies love their new cage. There is plenty of room for them to flitter around and play. Lots of room for toys and stuff too. Between the reviews here, plus feedback from a Parakeet group I administer on Facebook, comments on this cage have three consistent themes:  a part arrived damaged, it's difficult to assemble and the purchaser wouldn't hesitate to buy the cage again.  Consider this one more of the same. We ordered the extra large size (measurements given in the description are for the extra large, but the price is for the smaller cage.  Be sure to select the extra large if you are looking for a cage with the largest dimensions given.) and our birds LOVE it!  We have 5 parakeets who were previously in two smaller cages.  The three that were in one of those cages were squabbling and picking at each other, even though the cage is one of the largest non-flight cages available.  In this extra large flight cage, all five birds are happy together and there is plenty of room for the birds and their toys.  Giving the cage a 4 star instead of 5, as there were a couple of rough places we needed to smooth off with a Dremel.  But once that was done, we have been thrilled with the cage.  It is a little tricky to assemble, being so large, but using some zip ties and two people, it was not a challenge.  Highly recommended by our birds!  They have never been happier! initially I was going through setting it up fairly quick until there was a piece that didn't fit completely, it took a lot of effort for me to force it to fit. They do have a 90 day policy where you can receive a new part instead of returning everything but I didn't and just forced the parts together hopefully that doesn't cause problems down the road but otherwise it seems to be a decent cage and I think my conure is happy in all that space. My Cockatiel loves this palace. it did take her about 2-3 days to really start to get comfortable. HUGE is an understatement. I have to get her a mate now. The cage was fairly easy to assemble by myself, the sole issue being some panels were slightly bent but with manipulation they worked just fine and nestled into place. Birds are very intelligent and easily become depressed.  This is a HUGE cage that allows birds like finches and parakeets plenty of room to fly and play.  Flight is important for a birds mental health as well as physical health. Who made this? Someone with no hands/eyes? Awful. Parts missing, broken pieces, and warped metal/iron. Horrible manufacturing. Bad for birds. Company is going downhill :( I love most of this cage, but I had a mother and two baby parakeets, The bottom tray got knocked out (barley enough room from it to stay in place) and my birds got out and my dog killed them. I was so upset. ", "I am going to make a video review of this cage because I got it recently and already love it to pieces! I can name dozens upon dozens of reasons why it was an awesome choice, even beyond what I considered at the time of purchase. Since there are so few flaws/challenges I'll name those instead for now: 1) It says you need a partner to set it up. I didn't because I'm fierce. 2) Don't screw the bolts too tight or it warps the corners and creates cracks. 3) In spite of clear instructions I \"intuitively\" put the front pieces on in reverse. 4) The bowls are lame and they don't fit where they say they are supposed to go. They fit great on the box though, the lid of which I use as a foraging tray. 5) The lock on the grate at the bottom is annoying but removable and doesn't block the poop tray, only the grate over it. 6) You need to do some light engineering if you want to use the cage without the grate because it leaves too big a gap between the wall and the tray. 7) There is a lip on the inside left and right which collects poop (mostly from my tiel, not my keet, because he perches on the edge of the top of the cage). 8) The bars are very soft feeling, even compared to my cheap petstore cages. Not a problem for budgies and makes the cage light and easy to handle for the size. 9) The many side doors are spring loaded and don't have any kind of latch, not that it is an issue for me. 10) The bars are mostly vertical which is lame since birds prefer horizontal for climbing, but it is good for viewing and my birds climb fine on it just the same. P.S. Did you notice the 5 stars? I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I tell so many people to buy this cage that I should be given some kind of rebate by Prevue, hah. Both my birds and I love the cage, especially all the doors. I was a bit nervous about buying the cage after reading some of the reviews but I guess I was lucky. It arrived on time, all the pieces were there and undamaged. I lined up all the pieces and assembled it. It took me a little longer because I assembled it by myself and I\u2019m in a wheelchair paralyzed from the waist down. The second person helping was a pair of vice grips and string to hold up a side or two. It\u2019s still standing strong after a year or so. I even built a 2 \u00bd\u2019 high dowel rod jungle gym set the full size of the top. I will agree with everyone\u2019s comments about the wheels, the company could have invested a little more on the wheels Very nice cage.  2 people needed to assemble.  Nothing bent or broken, packaging was reinforced and I think that problem has been fixed since other posts.  Perches are very large, more cockateil than parakeet size.  Only thing I would mention about assembly:  make sure the base orientation is correct for insertion of bottom tray before building the cage and i would do left bottom, right bottom, back loosly screwed instead of left bottom and top, right bottom and top and back stacked.  Seriously, it's like Jenga the direction way or a crazy game of twister (left hand blue). It\u2019s advertised as suitable for parakeets but there are some pretty big gaps where the sections go together. I used zip ties to help hold the panels sections together, they didn\u2019t seem terribly sturdy. The coating was chipped off one corner of cage and metal underneath was a little rusty. Box was in bad shape on arrival but all prices were there.  I put it together by myself, took a couple hours. Instructions were ok, parts could have been labeled would have made it easier. LOVE IT -- BUY THIS! yes, was difficult to assemble, and one of the bars along the bottom had to be drilled in two places to receive one of the panels, but was SO worth it. took two of us about an hour or more to put together. I looked at a lot of cages in deciding what to get.  My birds and I both really love this cage. This is just the right size, big without overtaking the room it's in.  I have a couple parakeets in it and they love that there is room to actually fly from place to place.  Also plenty of room to add some natural branches and some toys and not clog up the flying space.  The small doors on the sides are a nice plus, easy to reach in to take care of food/water or toys without opening a big door.  Though I do wish the small doors had clips instead of just being spring loaded.  A larger bird wouldn't have much trouble learning to open them.  Nice sturdy cage on wheels, easy to move about the house if I want to.  Very happy with this purchase. Great cage! I needed something large because my flock grew from 2 parakeets to 4. They have do much room now, and are able to exercise their wings when they can't be out of the cage. The tray did arrive damaged, but I contacted Prevue, gave them some information, and they sent out a new tray right away. I always appreciate great customer service! I adopted a lost parakeet by accident, and had no idea what I was doing at first - my vet had to set me straight about appropriate cage size. These cages are large enough to meet most SPCA cage size standards, especially the extra large. They aren't perfect - assembly DEFINITELY takes two people, and if you've got an adventurous bird that tends to hop into doorways you should secure the tension-spring side doors with carabiners to avoid the risk of injury. Still, I'm giving this 5 stars for making an appropriately large cage affordable for those of us who are bird owners on a budget - I didn't find anything else that was as good for the money. This is also very sturdy - I have absolutely no concerns about sides unclipping, bottoms falling out, etc. Cleaning is also super easy via the pull-out tray and bottom grate. I've bought two of these cages now.  You can't beat the quality, size, for the price.  With the help of a few bread-ties strategically placed, I was able to assemble both cages by myself with very little stress. Read a lot of negative reviews, but couldn't pass up on the price and had to try it .. so glad I did! It didn't take too long to put together once I got the hang of it. While it had all the pieces, one of the food dishes was broken, but I really had no use for four anyway. It's so spacious and allows my glider to do his thing. Super satisfiedddd! ", "I have a rescued squirrel and this cage is perfect for him. I was afraid it was going to be cheap and flimsy but I was happily surprised. I set this up on my own in about half an hour roughly. Having two people would have been a lot easier but it can be done with only one person. The instructions were okay. I followed the pictures to make sure I was using the right parts in the right spots. I love that the bottom tray just slides out for cleaning as well as the bottom grate. I can also roll the whole cage outside when I need to clean and so the squirrel can have some fresh air and sunshine. I used zip ties to close the doors I don't use and there are plenty. 3 small doors on each side and 2 large doors on the front. Once you have it together, I think you will be very pleased. My cockatiel, Flipper, loves his new large home. He had originally lived his entire life in a small cage we got from his previous owner, but we decided to splurge and get him this cage so he could have more room to roam when we weren't home. Only minor downside is I always forget to close the bottom door when leaving for work so my father comes home and finds the bird on top of the cage with the top door closed and the bottom door open. It also rolls quite easily and cleans even easier. Assembly definitely needs 2 people because you need someone to balance a piece while the other screws it in. Warning: Inquisitive birds WILL investigate their snack supply on the shelf on the bottom and/or investigate the floor underneath. Also do not know what the small doors on the side are for. We use them to sneak treats to him while he thinks the door is closed. This is an excellent cage.  I'm very happy with this purchase. This thing is awesome! Firstly, I didnt know it came with three perches and four HUGE water and food dishes. That was a nice addition. Right now I have only have two finches inside. Super easy to assemble! Took me about 30 minutes but I kept stopping to focus on my tv show every once in awhile. Doing the top part was the hardest, because you had to get everything to align just right. I'm already thinking of buying another one! It did come bent on the top panel, like other people have mentioned. Honestly, given the super low price I cant complain. It was an easy fix, I just put a piece of wood to cover the top. My birds love this cage, which is roomy, and now filled with toys and natural branches and vines that provide some shock absorption when they land after a short flight. It took 2 of us 1 hour to put the cage together. Nice and spacious. However, after 6 months my green cheek conure has figured out how to open the 5 spring-loaded doors. Which would be ok, if he could figure out how to get back in, and if we didn't have a very stealthy and playful cat. I was amazed when my kids told me that the bird was out of his cage twice today, even though all of the primary gates and latches were secured. The side doors, intended primarily for the convenience of adding or changing food or water, are spring-loaded and don't mechanically latch. They rely on the spring pressure to keep closed. The spring pressure is light, not enough to prevent a bird from opening. What my conure does is forces the door open with his beak, then pushes his body through which keeps it open as he exits. I rarely ever leave feedback although we buy from Amazon several times a month.  I felt like this was the type of item to leave feedback for!  If you order this same cage from Pet Co or Pet Smart you will be close to or even over $400 once you include tax and shipping.  We bought the XL version througg Prime and got it today. It's sturdy, easy to put together, and huge! If you're looking for a great deal this is it. \u263a Overhaul I like the cage.  It\u2019s Sturdy and very large.  I gave it 3 stars for the following: I wish this product had bigger doors - I am using it for rats. It's amazing value per square inch - but the doors are small enough that it makes setting the enclosure up a slightly more challenging task than some of the comparable cages. Overall, though, this arrived without significant damage (two bent bars, easy to mostly straighten, one broken food dish). Overall, I like it so far. Assembly took me about an hour while being exceptionally tired and already slowing down for the day - easy enough assembly. It's handy to have someone taller if possible help to assemble. I'm fairly average (5'4\") and it had to be amusing to watch me try to attach the top of the cage. I would not home anything larger than a GCC, but this is a great home. If you're looking for something cheap but good enough, this is one step further. At the price of a cheap cage at a pet store, you get a massive home. The minimum space for a GCC is 20\"x 20\" x20\", so you're providing a great space. The tray makes cleaning easier, and Ria loves it. There is a little door that makes it easy to feed her or pour water. If you're debating on a temporary cheap cage for a large bird (nothing bigger than a large conure!) this is okay, and more preferable than a small similar quality cage. Another reason why you wouldn't want to house a larger parrot Here is because of the doors that will open if a bird strong enough tries. The reason why no larger birds is because of the spacing for their feet and the thin bars becoming vulnerable to beaks designed to break hard material. ", "I ordered the Large cage and it just came in today. I finished assembling it on my own about a hour ago, and my 3 parakeets love it! The cage was difficult to assemble on my own but instructions weren't bad if you are good at following pictures. The most annoying thing was the metal pegs would pop out on me when I tried  to line parts up to put in screws. I was one of the lucky ones, mine didn't come with burs, bent bars, missing or duplicate parts, or screw holes that didn't align or missing all together. Mine cage with four plastic bowls not sure  but thought it was only supposed to be 2 but no complaining! Like every one else I zip tied the side doors permanently shut. So far no complaints! Only worried about possible rusting down the road. I debated on buying this cage for a while because of negative reviews and all that... First off I just want to say it was extremely easy to build... compared to gym equipment, smokers, furniture and more, this was a breeze to put together. 6 simple steps and I was done! Small details I would suggest is have a needle nose plier handy(it'll say in the instructions), and be prepared to make a couple small changes due to shipping bending a couple (1 or 2) metal frames. They also give you a extra screw or 2 just in case 1 was faulty or you lose one somehow. There isn't many pieces so again, putting it together was a breeze(did it in an hour by myself). I give this cage an overall 4 because the doors are pretty lame, I would of preferred bigger doors on the front and for the side ones to at least latch or stick, but they are spring loaded, meaning my bird could escape or worse. Otherwise solid cage if you can't afford anything bigger and better.. also Pravue has a bunch of easy assessories made just for it! Normally I'd give a full five stars, but here's the thing. The item name says it's wrought iron, but last time I bought a wrought iron cage, bending the bars was just a biiiiit of a challenge. This cage came with pre-bent bars which I easily bent back into place. My budgies love it, but is it *really* wrought iron? This is doing it's job, but it's weird. One of the doors came with a guiding clip already broken off of it, so we almost never touch that door to open it. One of the holes to secure the top half of the cage was also bent in to prevent the top section from connecting to the bottom section. I had to use pliers to widen the hole so it could actually fit. This has survived the test of time.  I bought 2 social finches, and in less than 2 years, I have 10......and am now tossing the eggs or i would have 100.  This is still OK for size and the tray and bottom removable floor makes it easy to clean. The wheels make it each to move for cleaning, or the seasons.  In summer it sits by the window, but because of the location of the heating, I can't leave it there in winter.  I bought it because of the wheels, but now that I know how social the finches are, I'm glad I have it for the size!  I recommend 2 people to assemble it, but we didn't have any problems. I purchased this cage for my Borke Grasskeets. It does require assembly when it arrives and I left that to my husband. It would take 2 people or one very savvy person with longer arms to assemble on their own. ***WARNING: This cage's spring loaded feeding doors led to the death of a young parakeet who I'm guessing got caught in there and panicked. I found her hanging there with her head stuck. WIRE THEM SHUT!*** I personally assembled this by myself, though some parts were a tad difficult it was certainly manageable. I finally purchased this cage after reading recommendation after recommendation for it on the different budgie groups I am part of, and it doesn't disappoint. It gives my 4 budgies plenty of room to fly and get away from each other when they want to. My only recommendation is to make sure you clip the different doors closed as my budgies have been able to figure out how to open them and get out. Overall, fantastic product that I will recommend to all budgie owners I run into. This is a really nice cage. At first it looked a little flimsy but as soon as you put it together it is wonderful.  I was using a dog crate and it was hard to clean this will be a breeze. One of the dishes clip was broken but I found the part and glued it but it comes with 4 large dishes so it will be fine. My birds look so small in the cage which makes me happy it means they now have plenty of room.  I have 4 parakeets ind it's fine. I almost bought 2 and put them together which you can do but 1 is fine unless they have babies. Great cage for the price.  I'd actually give it 4.5 stars.  The instructions are ok.  They were a bit useless since the items in the pictures are too small to discern and none of the parts are labeled.  We used common sense and put the pieces in order (or at least what we assumed the correct piece was).  You will definitely need two people to put it together since all the sides need be aligned and held into place while putting this up. None ", "I was a little nervous about some of the reviews concerning missing or damaged parts and difficulties with assembly, but everything arrived in great condition and I easily and quickly assembled the cage by myself. I love this cage for its huge size, multiple doors on 3 sides for easy access, and slide out bottom grill and tray. I have one lovebird and there is no reason for any other cage in my case. So happy my bird has so much space and the cage is of a highly suitable quality for one small bird-just like advertised. The feeding cups are flimsy plastic will need to be replaced with better equipmemt in time but are functional for now and not important to the over all benefits of the cage. It arrived with one broken door lock and two broken feeders. Sad. Took two people to put together. Now we\u2019ve been using it for a while. The cage itself is sturdy. The wheels are sturdier than another Prevue cage we owned for years. The biggest pain is the plastic tray shrank after the first week of use, making us spend 10, 15 minutes to put it back after cleaning each time. The worse part is the loud falling noise scares the bird easily. When we are cleaning the grid, we are constantly worried about the tray falling out to let the bird out. The metal \u201cPrevue\u201d tag in the front is also unnecessary since it gets stuck in the grid all the time when you slide the grid in and out. The Amazon price for this cage is about half of where sold elsewhere.  The only drawback, is that I couldn't assemble it alone.  It is sturdy, and on my hard floors it is simple to roll around to clean underneath, place beside me at my desk, in and out of the sun, etc.  The global, high-quality wheels roll with esae.  Using zip ties, my surprisingly strong parrotlet has no chance of escape.  Zip ties can be removed quickly using side cutters.  American parakeets wouldn't be able to open these spring doors, most likely.  It has two small spring doors on the side and two 10 x 10\" latched doors on the front.  I recommend this cage with five big fat stars.  All parts arrived in pristine condition, undamaged.  . My two diamond doves love their new cage. I got the large size and it\u2019s plenty large for them. They primarily stay at the top because it\u2019s in front of the window and their swing and bridge are up there. But they do fly down to the bottom and perch to perch once in awhile. The cage was a pain to put together with 2 people because one side would keep popping out while you were doing the other side. Once the cage was set up though I was happy and so were my doves. They don\u2019t beg to come out of their cage all the time now since it\u2019s so much bigger. I don\u2019t use the grate on the bottom. I think only the tray is necessary. For 153. I was expecting more. The box came with several holes in it, there were bent wires in 5 places. The instructions are light grey with miniature part pics, and none of the panels are labelled. Sure I figured it out, but it took a while to identify different parts. Be careful, \"wrought iron\" is not really what we're dealing with here. Metal is quite soft and it's easy to strip the bolts if you tighten too much. The cage is sturdy, larger than expected and good.  However, I am using it for sugar gliders and it wasn\u2019t until I received the cage and transferred the critters that I realized the bars being predominantly horizontal would have been better for them.  We received the plastic floor tray cracked and have yet to hear back from customer service of Prevue Hendrix.  Amazon redirects us to them.  I don\u2019t want to send the whole thing back, but I also don\u2019t want a broken item, that I paid almost $200 for. Very poor customer service.  If you buy, cross your fingers that it comes to you in good condition.  Better yet, if buying for gliders, go with a DCN or a cage from Exotic Nutrition. We added three house sparrows to the family this summer.  They'd come in for rehabilitation, and weren't quite releasable, but too lively and cheerful and just plain full of beans to kill.  So they stayed.  We let them fly free in the house except at night, but the poop was an issue, so we needed a nice cage with lots of room for flying.  We needed to do it on a budget.  This cage is just shy of 18 cubic feet.  Comparably sized flight cages usually cost twice the price. I'm very pleased with this cage. Its the perfect size for my 5 cockatiels. I said I'd never purchase a cage w/vertical bars but I'm glad I tried it. Even though my tiels prefer the horizontal bars, they dont mind these bars. They still manage to get around just fine. One of my birds has a handicap (right foot is turned to side), as a result of momma being to big when sitting on him, and he gets around fine as well. I DID add a few perches to give them more options.  It was fairly easy to put together. Sometimes it took 3 ppl. And at 1 point, I had to take the whole top off and flip it around bcuz the back was in the front lol. Yes, this cage is very spacious and priced reasonably, but I found it very difficult to assemble. I was looking for a flight cage for my juvenile parakeet.  This was a brand new in the box, Prevue cage made in China.  It's powder coated \"antique silver\" (silver and black mottled finish, currently pretty stylish) not the wrought iron listed in the description (since wrought iron isn't made any longer pretty much at all let alone in China).  It was well packed but, unfortunately, somehow the very top front and back piece had the paint rubbed and it's a bit unsightly.  The cage was definitely a 2 person job to put together.  The instructions aren't great - mostly because the pictures are soooo tiny you can't possibly figure out which piece is which based upon those.  We knew just because we already have 4 bird cages and have put together our fair share of cheap furniture before.  We'd get 2 pieces put together, start on the next 2 and the first set would start coming out (you can't tighten everything until later because you can't fit later pieces in...)  We finally got smart enough to start putting zip ties on to hold pieces in place so they wouldn't slip out before we tightened bolts.  I strongly recommend this to anyone trying to put it together. ", "I have some expensive cages that are heavy and durable. They were also $500. This cage is \"flimsy\" compared to these...but I realize now that my small parrots don't need heavy duty cages so long as the metal is safe (it is) and they can't escape (they can't). This cage is an affordable breath of fresh air - literally! It lets light in, is more versatile, and is more \"climbable\" than our posh cages. A strong recommend.  Arrived on time, no damage, easy assembly. I had my doubts after reading other reviews.. I was so pleasantly surprised by this cage for my canary! He is singing right now and has room to fly. I am 72 and put it together by myself.  The directions were very clear It's a very good cage for the price! I got an XL and it's as described... Plus it has wheels! I didn't know that when I bought it! She has 3 of them. One of these cages are the perfect size for a cockatiel. She uses one for outside in the summer, one as a cockatiel cage and one for her budgie. She has also put 2 cages back to back for use as one big cage. However there is a slight quality difference between each cage she has, she has 2 of the brand name prevue cages and a different brand she can't identity that she received form this listing where she got the first cage. The second (not prevue) cage is still ok. The third cage she got recently is of the prevue brand like the first cage she bought. I usually don't post any recommendations but felt I needed to. This cage is fantastic. It's huge but sturdy. I have one male love bird and he can fly in here. Plenty of room for his toys. Feeding cups and perches were in excellent condition and all holes were drilled correctly. As previously stated by others, the smaller doors are not very secure if you have a bird who is adamant on getting out. Twist ties worked fine on keeping him in the cage. Overall you are paying for what you get. As other reviews have said this product comes with terrible directions. However with common sense, the cage is easily put together. Also, referring to other reviews, there is a good chance something will be bent out of shape or broken when you get it. My particular cage had 1 bent bar, a chipped trey (around the rim, still usable), and the lock on one door was installed wrong (Can still be opened). Overall these are not huge problems. Ok i got this large cage its for my Alexandrine parakeet. She loves it. very spacious she moves around the cage with no problem. Instructions are very simple but do recommend two people for a job. Cage is strong for the price. Easy to clean bottom tray slides out. Does come with wheels but did not install them. Has 3 small doors on right side and left side of the cage 2 door's on top and 1 on the bottom. Also Has two big doors on front of the cage. Comes with 4 trays for food and 3 wooden sticks for birds to sit on. Do recommend buying plastic because my parakeet loves biting wooden sticks. Over all very happy with the product. We bought this for our two Australian Budgerigars (larger than parakeets, smaller than Cockatiels) .  We call it the \"Play Pen\" because they have plenty of room to do so.  We wanted lots of room for toys and ladders etc.  This cage is solid but not excessively heavy; it rolls easily on four wheels. Lots of opening  doors on front and sides but none on the back.  I can easily work around that but it would have been nice to have.  There is a nice debris  catching tray at the bottom that slides out for easy removal to clean.  Tip: I buy a big roll of white freezer paper at Costco and tear off sheet to place on the tray.  It fits perfectly, is inexpensive and makes cage cleaning a snap. I bought this flight cage and it was delivered to our home within 3 business days in a heavy cardboard box. This cage has to be assembled. In reading the instructions for assembly which was on one page on the front and back, it became clear to me that this would take a little longer to assemble. The pictures on the directions of each step could have been much larger to read and see. You need to make sure that you put the cage sides together correctly and line them up properly before tightening the screws. We found out the hard way with 1 or 2 of the cages that were not fully lined up before the screws were tightened.  I also found out that you need an extra person or two to hold the sides of the cages while you put in the screws with the Allen wrench. It took about 35-45 minutes to assemble the cage which was not too bad I thought. I purchased this cage because I wanted to encourage my \u201cclipped\u201d green cheeked conure to fly. She is doing just that. The cage is well suited as a flight cage and holds lots of entertaining toys. ", "Yes this is a great price for a bird cage  ..It arrived on time  and the box was pretty heavy it actually has a sticker that says  HEAVY.  Opened it and found all the screws thrown throughout the box.  So i was hopeful they all were there, and they were. Much to my surprize it is grey and black speckled...not solid black.  That was ok but disappointing.  Then started to assemble it and none of the pieces were marked.  Yes it took a while but we figured it out.  Would have been so much easier to have the pieces marked.  Be aware....when it says in small print  requires 2 people to assemble it they are not kidding.  Its flimsy to assemble and the alan wrench is always a challenge.  The cage is not that sturdy, I have a few Flight cages and they are strong, this one is not.  I dont like the doors they are spring closing NOT LATCHING  and the spring is like a feather  in resistance. Iam going to need to figure out a latch for  each of the 8 doors.  The perches which came with it...are not for Parakeets...they are too thick...so that was sad too.  You get what you pay for...thats for sure.... The cage, once put together is great! The problem is the directions. In particular, the simple fact that the directions have labels for each piece, but there's no indication on the pieces themselves as to which piece they are. Labeles would have made assembly MUCH easier. It's for this reason, I have to give it three stars. HOWEVER, it's a solid product. It arrived with no damage. It was packed well and my two parakeets seem much happier with the larger space. This cage is great! Good quality and materials. Took us about an hour to put together. We have ringneck doves in this cage and it is the perfect size (our doves do get daily flight time each day). It even has room for the custom nesting box that we built. The food/water dishes are definitely more for smaller birds such as parakeets or finches so we ended up replacing those but that was to be expected. Our doves are very happy. The bars are on the thinner side so I wouldn't recommend for a heavy chewer or parrot type of bird as I feel as they could easily bend/break the bars. Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase! I use the bowls it came was as water bowls, but my budgies can\u2019t reach the perch so they sit on the rim of the bowl and drink from there. Problem is, if they turn around while sitting on the rim, which they do very often, they end up pooping in the water. And sometimes they sleep on the bowl, and they all sleep together so they\u2019ll be 6 budgie morning poops in the water. But again, easy fix, I\u2019ll be getting different water bowls. It\u2019s a little smaller than expected, I thought about returning it and getting an extra large but my birds took to this cage right away. Some of them are still skittish/not tame and this quickly became their \u201csafe space\u201d, and stay calm even for the few hours a day when all the doors are open for them to fly around. Good cage overall A lot of people warned me that my conure may bend these bars or that the cage was cheaply made but I am very happy with it. It is very big and roomy for him so I do not feel guilty if I have to leave him in the cage if I have to go out somewhere. I\u2019ve had no issues with him bending the bars at all. The assembly is kind of a pain if you are doing it alone but other than that, once it\u2019s assembled it\u2019s very easy to clean and maneuver. I love it. This cage is awesome! I have 3 parakeets and they are enjoying the massive flying room. At first they were sitting on the top perch looking up and down the cage.  They seemed unsure at first.  But now they are happily fluttering around the cage. We had our parakeets in two separate cages that were made of thin wires. I adopted a cat who took great interest in the birds, so I got this cage. It is the exact sturdiness I was looking for. Easy to piece together myself. The litter pan is super easy to remove for cleaning, but also stays in place when moving the cage. I ziptied a few of the doors shut and put clips on the ones I would be using. No other modifications were necessary to keep my birds safe. My cat has latched onto the side of the cage, climbed it, and sat on top of it with no harm at all to the birds (they are super chill and accustomed to the busy household) or the cage. 4 parakeets (budgies) are in the cage with plenty of toys and they still have room to fly around. Pretty easy to put up. I bought this for my caique. It gives him plenty of space to move around and hang all of his toys. He is pretty smart and has figured out how to open the side doors that do not have locks. So I would say to find a way to lock those side doors if you have a bird who is good at figuring out how to escape. It is cheap metal in my opinion. But decently sturdy. For the space he gets and how easy it is to put together, it is a pretty great buy for the price. I do wish the space under the bottom tray was a bit taller to store his bags of foods and snacks easier. This is a fantastic cage! I put it together quickly and easily but myself with a toddler \"helping\". I believe some of the reviews are for an older build. This on takes only 12 1.5\" screws and is very simple to assemble. All the pieces fit perfectly. The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me is because the side pieces are identical so when assembled the crossbars are on the inside but out on the other and the nesting box doors open from the opposite direction. But its certainly not a deal breaker and you cant beat the price. It's a huge cage with smaller bar spacing that will give my parrotlet a lot of room. This cage is built really well! putting it together was really easy (hint: don't tighten any of the screws until your done with the assembly). After 2 weeks in the cage, my two parakeets are now flying in it. This cage is nice and huge for these small birds. I'll probably by another to get store-bought parakeets ready and able to fly in my large aviary without living on the ground until their clipped wings grow back. ", "So the cage is nice, it\u2019s plenty spacious for my two parakeets and there\u2019s lots of room for toys. The wheels are great and it was fairly easy to put together, it says it requires two people but I did it alone no problem. However, two of the bars were not secure so I had to secure it myself because it made the space big enough for a bird just to wiggle right through, also I received duplicate panels for the back side (rather than top/bottom, I got top/top) instead of making a fuss about it I just secured these panels together in the middle with zip ties and it works just fine. I think the low price of such a spacious cage makes up for the discrepancies, I would overall recommend just beware it might not be perfect based on my experience and other reviews. I wanted the largest bird cage I could afford.  I decided to purchase this one based on the size, the price, and the high number of positive reviews.  The additional customer photos were also very helpful. I bought this cage a little under 2 years ago for a group of rats. I had to modify it by adding shelves and ramps for the rats, but this was easy to do. The spring doors on the sides are handy but rats can of course push their way right out, but I bought tiny heart locks on Amazon also that keep them shut and are kinda cute :) I love how I can pull the grate and tray out to wipe them down, and the bars havent rusted even with rat pee all over them(much worse than birds lol). The trays and ramps have had to be replaced several times, but this cage could last forever. It is also very large, and the perches are sturdy if you want a large bird sitting on them. I would definitely recommend it. I initially purchased one wrought iron flight cage. It arrived right on time, securely packaged. All pieces were included and there was no damage. The instructions were easy to follow and I had the cage assembled  by myself in a short time. I still cannot believe how sturdy and well made this cage is for the price! In fact I was so impressed I bought two more! I use them to house my zebra and society finches. The birds have a lot of space  and the feather pulling and fighting over perch space is totally gone. The birds are happy and so am I. I recommend this cage to anyone wanting a nice piece of furniture to show off their birds. We used this cage for our ringneck doves and they love it! It has tons of space for them and they are quite big. The assembly was a bit hard and it definitely helps to have someone to help you. We actually couldn't get the top piece completely secured to the sides but it still worked out okay. Once it is assembled, it is very sturdy, and comes with four water and food containers. Great cage! I love this cage so far!! It was fairly simple to put together and my 4 parakeets LOVE IT!! They seem to fly way better in this cage. They love flying and playing on their toys. I feel like the other small cages they had were too small. This is a nice LARGE cage. The side doors do not latch shut, they are on a spring and swing shut if you are afraid your bird may figure out how to open the doors and do not want that to happen,  you could put a zip tie on it black is almost unnoticeable Well if you decide to purchase this product grab a friend that to help you assemble it it's always nice to have extra hands to hold panels while you install. Firstly I live this cage it is beautiful and my tiels have loads of space , it\u2019s easy to clean and convenient to move and clean behind HOWEVER, assembling wasn\u2019t easy because in the manual the pieces where labelled R1 L1 R2L2 ok fine but there was no way to tell which piece was which so it\u2019s very easy to assemble it incorrectly and realize that almost at the end. My other issue is that a few bars where bent and out of shape such as the door on the top was bent enough that my bird almost escaped and bending it back is not easy , bars on the side and bottom are bent also and can\u2019t be moved back as the metal is very strong , over all tho it\u2019s a beautiful cage worth the hassle but a discount for bend and misshapen bars should of been issued This is a very well made cage for the price. Much easier to put together with 2 people, but can definitely be done alone. Although some people have said this wouldn\u2019t work for a medium sized parrot, I bought this as a second cage for our eclectus and they love it. Parrot is out of cage most of the day and can go in or out as they please, so that might be a factor in whether this would work for you. Have had no problems with the cage and would definitely purchase again. Great cage and a great value. It arrived damaged though but that's obviously not the seller's fault. The bottom tray came cracked but I needed it right away so I kept it. I didnt want to send back the whole cage just for that. This is a fantastic cage though so large and has doors all over the close automatically on a spring for safety. Defintly cat proof which really helps in my house. Really love this cage and so does my dove, I'll be buying another one soon and hopefully UPS can manage to deliver it without breaking it this time. Its packaged well so it mustve been roughed up in delivery. ", "I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about this cage after it was built for my two cockatiels, but it is working out nicely. All parts arrived in good shape, and my partner (who is quite good a following instructions) was able to build it easily. We did have a small issue when we had to re-position one side that wasn't aligned correctly after we built the cage. The screws the cage came with quickly became stripped, so it is clear that the hardware that came with the cage isn't the best quality (thus, the 4 stars). That said, once the cage building process was complete it seemed sturdy and our birds are most content! If your cockatiels are like mine and prefer chilling at the top of the cage, this will be a nice home for about 4 cockatiels. It's also a great cage for budgies or other small birds that won't do damage to the metal bars with their beaks (also not a good choice for birds who easily escape because there are several small doors along the sides of the cage that are spring-loaded and thus can be pushed open). There also isn't a real great barrier of any sort around the bottom of the cage, so you may need to purchase a seed net to avoid a mess. I'm happy with the cage and my cockatiels are enjoying their new home. We may even add a new cockatiel friend since we have the space! I've had this cage set up for about a month now and have nothing but good things to say about it.  The thing is a great size and comes with a handful of bowls and perches to get you started.  You definitely have a ton of room to add other things to keep your bird(s) active and playing.  There are several doors on both sides and 2 main larger doors on the front.  The front ones latch whereas the side ones kind snap shut.  It's been very easy to clean and it has wheels that allow for mobility. I purchased the regular size. Great cage for budgies. Wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold up against anything bigger than a cockatiel. Amazing flight cage for the price. You can assemble it by yourself if you are super handy and patient. However, you will most likely want to have a friend to help you for some of the steps. It is by no means exemplary in terms of sturdiness or it\u2019s design. But it is definitely great for the price, many similar sized cages can go for up to $400 or more. t will work great for cockatiel sized birds or smaller. Esta jaula la utilizo para la crianza de finches. Es muy conveniente porque, debido a que es sumamente espaciosa, facilitando el que mis finches se mantengan muy activos,  libres de volar de un lado a otro. None This cage is OK once you're done putting it together, but as others had mentioned in their comments it's hard to assemble, the instructions are poorly written and the parts are not labeled. The main problem I encountered was warped pieces and holes that don't align properly with the screws, and need to be forced in with the risk of breaking the whole piece. The plastic food trays don't align and 2 out of 4 came already broken and the other two will probably break after removing for cleaning a couple of times and there is no way to contact the seller, so you will end buying those separate, adding to the cost of the cage. Also, I got this cage for finches, I wouldn't recommend it for big birds as they could open the little doors easily from inside with a little push. This bird cage was an excellent buy! It is an excellent quality, sturdy and well built. It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to put together. A nice weight -- not flimsy like the cage we returned to the pet store. We put it together in less than an hour.  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  The coating on the metal wires is shiny, smooth and easy to clean.  Hammered black -- seems to be a baked on finish. Very attractive and easy to see the birds through the black finish.  Wheels roll easily.  A lower shelf to put cover and seed etc on.  My pair of lovebirds are so very happy in this cage.  With the addition of two short perches in the top section they can truly \"fly\" across this flight cage.  It is not fair or humane to keep birds in little cages and if  at all possible they deserve the biggest cage their humans can manage... and this certainly fulfills those needs. I would recommend and buy this cage again.  Plenty of room for toys, nesting box, swings etc. Good seed and water cups .. 3 long good quality perches included. Prvue cage cover purchased separately -- excellent. I bought this to home my glider. His other cage was a lot smaller and needed more room for him to play and hold all his toys. It only took me about a half hour to put together. Having so many small access doors makes cleaning this cage a breeze. It comes in handy for hanging his pouches and toy's. No more spill's or leaky water bottles for me to clean up. Having four bowls with dividers makes it even easier for me to feed him and get to his water. I really am pleased with this cage.  I'm 66, (almost:), 5'5\" and 118 lbs and had very little problem putting it together myself.  I guess I got lucky, no bent bars and all the holes were there, unlike some of the reviewers who did have bent bars and lacking holes.  The reason for the 4 stars is the feeder cups.  They are VERY difficult (at least mine are) to attach to the bars.  They take some struggle and with finches, these little guys can get out when I've got the doors open struggling to get the feeder cups in and out.  I'd never put water in them because by the time I got them attached, I'd be splashing all the water out.  And, one of my cups came with a broken hook.  That's not really a problem because I plan on replacing all of these feeder cups with feeders that are easier to attach. This is a great cage and not a bad price. I have two of them for each of my two green cheek conures. They have tons of space and it\u2019s very easy to take out the grate and tray to clean. There\u2019s two big doors and some side doors though I\u2019ve zip tied the side doors so my babies don\u2019t decapitate themselves. It\u2019s awful to assemble especially by yourself(I assembled both solo!) definitely have another set of hands when you put it together! I would say it\u2019s good for any bird that\u2019s conure size or smaller. Maybe a slightly bigger bird than that but it\u2019s not the strongest cage ever but like I said, perfect for a conure, maybe two. Oh and I have the covers that fit it so I don\u2019t have an ugly sheet over it. ", "Absolutely amazing cage! Huge, great quality/sturdy, easy to assemble (kiddos and I did it in like 45 min), and super versatile. Our Sun Conure loves it! This wasn't too hard to put together. Needs two people, though. Instructions were okay and image helped a lot. Great quality. Couldn't ask for a better cage. Works perfectly. Glad I bought it and give it two thumbs up! I like the flight cage.  A small bird really can fly in there.  It was not impossible to put together, but it took 2 of us about 3 hours.  Side bars kept popping out.  It was challenging.  This large cage is not as sturdy as my previous cages which had thicker wires that would not bend.  But the trade off is this cage is much lighter to move around.  It also seems easier to clean because the wires are so thin.  This is perfect for parakeets, but is it sturdy enough for a parrot? I do like this cage now that I have it put together but it wasn\u2019t fun putting together. I have 2 screws remaining and had to use a zip tie in it\u2019s place to hold everything together. There was nothing for the screw to screw into... just a hole. Also the instructions say the two back panels are identical and interchangeable which is not true. Overall I do like the cage but just know the assembly is not a good time. The size of this cage is perfect for my four budgies  However, it started to rust immediately after I washed it. This happened despite the fact that I towel dried it, and let it sit in 80 degree direct sun so it would dry quickly. I bought a first one and although it was much larger than what the birds had become used to I wasn't sure the term 'flight cage' should be used as we have 4 cockatiels.  They might have been able to fly vertically but not horizontally. Okay, first off this was delivered on a Sunday, Easter Sunday. That is dedication and I feel a bit guilty about a guy working on Easter Sunday on my behalf. Monday delivery would have been just fine! I enlisted the help of my teenager. We assembled this cage handily, in one hour and ten minutes. It took us a bit longer than some, but we are a meticulous breed and we did a slow and steady pace and made no mistakes. Given that neither one of us is mechanically inclined, this was a great feat for us. You definitely need two people to assemble. One person has to hold the panels in place while the other puts in the screws. Three people would have cut the assembly time and some of the frustration of first one side, then the other, slipping out of place while attempting to attach the screws. This Cafe was returned by a prior purchaser. There were several holes missing, so I had to drill them myself. The panels have two inch long tines that sit in corresponding holes on lower panels? The panels have to be stacked atop each other and screwed together. Some of those holes were not aligned properly and again I had to drill holes. The two large doors are way too easy to open. My birds got out and were unfortunately killed by my dog, as they were young and could only flutter about This is a really nice size cage with plenty of room for my 4 parakeets. I was able to put the cage together by myself even though in the directions it recommends 2 people. It would make it a lot easier if you had someone help you, but it is not impossible to do by yourself. I bought the same cage 3 years ago and it was wonderful....so I bought another one for my Sugar Glider. One of the bars on the back panel is not securely attached and have to hold together with rope. There's a huge gap on the bottom grate where she gets stuck between the grate and the litter pan and almost squished herself in there hiding. I'm not thrilled with this second purchase and feel it might fall apart very quickly. Corners were definitely cut making this cage. ", "Great cage. Price has gone up since I bought it, but was a good deal for the price I paid at under $100. Budgies have room to fly. The cage arrived in good condition. I was able to put it together by myself with the help of a corner in the room, but I have put these types of cages together before. I didn't pay attention to the fact that it has a plastic tray instead of a metal one. Not a deal breaker for the price, but I do like a metal tray for cleaning purposes better. All-in-all a good bargain. Great product for the price. Comes with Tool to put it all together. Lots of room for him now. He seems to like it. I did get new water dishes and food dishes because the ones that come with it are white and I prefer the clear ones. Very good value!!! My lovebird and I couldn't be happier with his new cage. It was on sale for $119 and is one of the best things I have purchased recently.  Even given the dimensions I was unprepared for just how roomy it is. I could have a whole flock of critters living here! After putting this cage together I love it! My green cheek conure loves it too. It is kind of flimsy like the other reviews state, so any birds larger than a sun conure/green cheek could probably destroy it. The cage was extremely frustrating to put together since you need at least two people to hold up multiple pieces while screwing it together. It took my brother and I about an hour. You also might want to zip tie some of the smaller spring loaded doors especially if you have a smart birdie. I could easily see my conure figuring out the doors and escaping.  Other than that it's super roomy and the wheels work great! The wooden perches are also awesome since the cage is so wide. Overall I'd definitely recommend this cage for smaller sized birds since it's so affordable and spacious! When I received the cage the bottom tray was badly cracked - was able to repair sufficiently with gorilla glue since its outside of the actual cage itself. My bird (Olive) is an African Brown-headed parrot, about the size of a conure. Very roomy for her, I think it will hold up well but cage is slightly flimsy - door lock contraption came apart but was able to fix by looking closely at lower door and copying placement. Just can't be too rough with it and should be fine. I had read a review that said this would take a lot of time to set up so I was quite ready to spend my afternoon with a screwdriver and the instruction pamphlet.  However, it arrived while I was at work and by the time I got home my 11 year old son had put it entirely together.  I love the fact that it rolls around.  There is a ton of space for my two parakeets.  In fact, the parakeets were so used to a smaller cage that they are still pretty much just hanging out at the top of it and looking around as if to say, \"Wowzers Jimmie - what are we going to do now?\"  I bought a bunch of extra toys to hang around the cage to make it more fun for them.  The bottom is incredibly easy to pull out and clean.  I have two cats.  One of them is a male hunter type of fellow but after spending the first night about a foot away from the cage watching them intently, he lost interest and realized there wasn't much point to try and get in.  So, the cats meander on by and pay no mind to the budgies inside.  All is well and we've had it about two weeks now so I'm happy with my purchase.  The price is very  reasonable for this size of a cage. I bought this flight cage for my 4 budgies who were feeling overcrowded in their old flight cage. This cage was a steal from this seller at $94 (and free S&H) compared with big-name retailers (and a few sellers here on Amazon) who were charging 2- 3X this price (and charging for the S&H). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this bird house (cage). Putting it together was fun (I was born to put things together), but I can see how someone all alone might be challenged with assembly. A competent helper would have been nice, but with a few pieces of wire and some patience, I put it together in 45 minutes. It's got the high quality of a big parrot cage but created especially for wee birds. I have two rowdy budgies and they love it! The casters work wonderfully, and it doesn't rattle to beat the band when I move it (like some of the cheaper wire cages). The only thing I wish it had was at least one panel of horizontal bars. I didn't use the perches supplied with it, but they looked okay. I use booda rope perches and branches from the trees in the yard. The feeders attach well, and all those access doors are great. All in all a good house for the money. The cage is great for our three budgies.  We are able to open the large front gates and they are able to fly in and out during the day and it secures well for the night.  The cleaning tray easily pulls out, and the large doors make it easy to change water and food. Nice size cage. I have 5 cockatiels in it, and they are very happy.  The only thing I don't like is the small feeding doors on the side, which are spring closing. I would prefer they slide up instead, as it would be safer for my control and easier to use when attaching a nesting box if desired, as I could just clip the door up when using a nesting box.  There is no way to do that with the spring doors.  Also, it would be nice to have a couple smaller doors on the front side. ", "This is a big cage for the price. When it came in the mail some parts where slightly bent but after setting it up you don't notice. I use this cage for my one sugar glider and he loves the space. Two big problems with this cage though, it stains from my animals urine and it's rusting. I bought this cage because the old cage was old and rusty which is extremely unsafe for sugar gliders. I've only had this cage for 9 months and it's already time to look for a different brand that will hopefully last longer. If you're not going to let your birds out they really do need the largest space possible, and I've found that these flight cages are ideal.  There are plenty of doors for easy maneuverability when installing perches, toys and food and water cups. I received this item very quickly. I started immediately when I got home from work. About an hour later, the box was finally open. The company must have read the past complaints.  My box arrive in good condition and better protected than most boxes.  The insides were protected with bubble wrap and Styrofoam.  I had a complete set of instructions which were well written and included  pictures for each step.  The wheel casters are the best I've seen on any cage or piece of furniture that I have assembled.  The tray is fine.  I had a flight cage (no longer being made) with 2 trays the same size.  They were made out of metal and were so heavy I hated pulling them out.  While placing the various bird accouterments, I did notice 2 bars were slightly bent.  They are not noticeable at a distance > 5 inches.  I did not bother straightening them.  It took me 1.5 hours to put the cage together by myself.  The overweight 50 year old lady who put hers together in 30 minutes deserves an award.  If you are working alone you will want something (tape, twist ties, etc) to help hold the upper side parts of the cage  while securing the top.  I do not like the door closing mechanisms., but that is easy to work around.  There are a lot of doors on this cage, 2 large in the front and 3 smaller on each side.  I will use this cage for finches and it seam perfect.  . We bought this floor cage because our zebra finches multiplied unexpectedly and we were in three cages.  We needed to consolidate the cages to make more effective our use of time in daily changes of water and food and in cleaning the cages, and to provide all the birds with prime window space.  We find that cleaning out the bottoms of most hanging or table bird cages to be difficult to do well and the biggest consumer of housekeeping time in bird care an feeding.  This \"flight cage\" looked like the best solution, and has a moderate cost, something not shared with most other offerings of its type.  Construction is not the simplest because it requires that wires from multiple sides of the cage be routed into retaining holes in the frames of the top and sides during assembly, and two people *are* required for proper assembly.  But the result is magnificent.  Two front doors and two doors on each side provide easy access, and no more birds sneaking out past your hand while you are reaching for a bird-bath bowl or other object, because they have plenty of room to stay away from your hand while you are working with the cage.  And, the birds seem much happier, flying around a lot and almost no squabbling among themselves anymore.  The large bottom tray with separate pull-out screen makes bottom cleaning a breeze, which is a really big time-saver.  And, we haven't had a bird escape since we got this new cage. This is just the large cage I was looking for, my birds love the extra space.  I ordered white (and paid more for it) because I wanted to easily see the birds.  It was easy to assemble even for one person.  The directions were very clear, except for putting the front panels on.  The directions stated that the back panels were the same, so it didn't matter which was one was lower  or upper .  But the front panels are different.  I put one on wrong and had to take it off, stripping the allen bolt (and it took quite a while to get it off).  All parts were included and in good condition, no noticeable rough spots.  I would buy this cage again! I was a bit worried when I ordered this cage due to some of the previous reviews about damage and improper fit.  However, I received the carton in great shape and all the parts were enclosed in great condition.  Everything was wrapped in plastic bags and the carton was bound with straps and corner reinforcement. The cage came well packaged. It was a bit difficult setting up because holes were a bit hard to align. The cage is fairly sturdy and the birds are much happier in a larger cage. It comes with several food and water receptacles.  The cage feels like it's going to be filmsy while setting up but after after this put together it feel more substantial. I hesitated after reading the many reviews regarding bent pieces, holes not drilled correctly, bad directions, etc, but I'm glad I went ahead and ordered this cage.  Apparently Amazon and the manufacturer have been reading your reviews. I bought this for finches, it\u2019s definitely huge. I\u2019ll start with the bad, there were two holes that were supposed to be there and they were not. This took me about 5 minutes to get my drill and fix that problem so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal at all. Other than that, there were no missing or broken parts and it seems well made. The cage takes about 30 minutes to put together by yourself and the instructions are pretty straight-forward. Some people might need help at the start when you\u2019re creating a base but I was able to do it on my own. This is a great cage and a really good value for the money in my opinion. Don\u2019t let all the reviewers who said it was hard to put together deter you, I think a 10 year old can easily put this thing together, it\u2019s not complicated at all. Get the extra large, your birds will thank you for the extra room. ", "FUNCTIONALITY: I just got this yesterday and had a friend help me put it together. I could have done it alone but it was nice to have an extra pair of cooperative hands. It is a very simple, sleek, functional cage and I am so excited about it! The instructions were clear and easy to follow. All parts were included and fit together well.  It rolls nicely and the tray and grate slide out easily as well. Bought this cage Sept 2017 for parakeets, and was very pleased. Bought another last week to replace a different cage for another group of parakeets, and am disappointed in the decline in quality. Bars are not quite as sturdy, doors don't latch closed as well, it just isn't the same quality. And I paid $20 more for it than I did last year. I'm not happy about that. I'm keeping it, because it will work, but I'll look elsewhere when I need another cage. This cage is HUGE! I love it, and so do my birds! Wasn't so hard to assemble, but did help to have two people to hold in place. This is such a nice house for my birds - they have room to fly about, and love the double food cups that came with. I really like this cage a lot, and can't find anything to complain about with it. Very happy indeed! What the heck I was not expecting this to be this nice of a cage, at $85 soooooo much cheaper than many of the other cages I looked at, I was expecting poorer quality and not to be as big as the pictures depict, however its HUGE and quality is top notch, even the wheels on the bottom don't catch and allow the cage to move around easily, still can't get over the price, pet stores had cages 1/2 the size for more than what I paid. I recommend this product to anyone that could use a big bird cage.  I have two cockatiels and once they adjusted to their new quarters they have become more playful.  I had been checking the local pet shops for a huge cage and the pricing was more than I wanted to pay.  The price and size for this cage was exactly what I was looking for.  It does take two people to assemble only because someone needs to hold the sides for a few minutes until it is secured in place.  The difficulty of assembling the cage is about 2 with 5 being the most difficult.  The only reason being is it would have been more helpful if the manufacture put sticky tags on each piece to match the letter parts on the instructions.  I have assembled storage units that were labelled exactly as the instructions with sticky labels which took the guess work out of the process.  If the identification of parts would have been better I would have given this product the top 5 stars, but only because there is some guessing for the consumer I gave this product a 4.  However, I still highly recommend this product for anyone that would like to give their bird(s) more room to play.  It is terrific. The feeding bowls came broken and they are VERY tough to utilize in the cage. The spacing between the knobs and the actual cage spacing are very much off. You have to bend the bars by hand to make it fit. This ensures you will spill a lot of the contents. This is my second time purchasing one of these cages. It definitely takes two people to put together. It is a fantastic size for almost any size bird. I currently have 10 finches in it and they act like it's heaven compared to a cage that I bought previously of a \"recommended\" size. Bought this cage for 3 parakeets.  Easy to set up, sturdy, and large!  Several small doors for access.  Tray pulls out for cleaning and storage is under tray.  Nice quality cage! My princess is very happy with this cage. I ordered the XL size for her (She's an Indian Ringneck) and it's the perfect amount of space. It took about an hour for me to set up by myself, and the package was light enough for me to carry upstairs to my apartment. Instructions were pretty clear, and all the parts were there. VERY good cage with a super reasonable price. I would recommend this for small to medium birds. It's not strong enough for bigger birds like cockatoos or Amazon's, etc. A bird like that could easily escape or bend the wires. The bars are close enough together for birds as small as parakeets. Definitely recommend this! ", "I bought this cage back in March for my cockatiel. She loves her mansion. I bring this cage indoors and outdoors with me everyday. When outside, I always have the cage in a caged patio. The many doors are super convenient when cleaning up or when re-arranging the cage. This cage is definitely not for those who have birds that have destructible beaks since the cage bends fairly easily. But you will need to buy several different types of perches for your buddy to get around. This product would have received 5 out of 5 except that the tray to hold the dropping was 1/4 of an inch too short and would not fit in the slider. The tray would just drop out. I feel as if they sent me a tray which was for another smaller birth cage. I hope that I can get a new tray since the birdcage itself is great and my birds just love. I did add this plastic corner piece on each side just to help secure the plastic tray but even with this, the tray will sometime fall out. Does anyone know how I can expand the edge of the dropping catcher so it will actually fit in the slots? This is a wonderful cage for sugar gliders.  Tristan and Istubella are very happy in their new home.  The slide out bottom tray is very convenient for cleaning out every other day.  For days I do the deep clean, it's a snap to roll this cage outside and hose it down.  The wood perches are pretty useless after a few days since it's difficult to get the urine out, but the plastic trays that they come with are great for putting in dry cereal or snacks for the gliders.  I even hide yogurt bites in the tray among other little items so the gliders can forage around for the yogurt bites.  They really seem love this cage.  In fact, I'm thinking to buy another one to connect to my existing cage and maybe get a couple more gliders.  You definitely won't be disappointed for purchasing this cage.  You get so much and at such a great price!! This is a sturdy cage, and the shelf on the bottom is a nice extra for supplies.  Four smaller doors on each side, and two larger on front give good options to reach in.  The final assembled product is definitely five star!  However, I will say an improvement could be to label the panels in order to save time figuring which piece is for what.  You definitely need at least one helper to hold things in place while assembling, two helpers even better! Purchased the cage two months ago for my two cockatiels. They love all the room they now have compared to their previous cage which was about a third the size. Assembly between my husband and I was a struggle, as the pieces are pretty flimsy, and you have to get the pins in the grooves. Once assembled it is a bit more sturdy. It is very light and easy to roll back and forth from room to living room. I wouldn't put anything on top as I think it would cave in. I also did not hang any rope for that reason. I would not buy this if you have anything bigger than a cockatiel, or an overly destructive bird who likes to chew on the bars. I'm pretty sure they could easily be snapped through with a couple of bites. This is a wonderful bird cage.  It came in a flat box, with instructions, and I had no problem putting it together by myself within an hour.  To assemble alone, I just laid the pieces on the floor as if the cage were on it's back, held the sides up by leaning the pieces on nearby chairs.  Easy enough.  The quality is good.  The bars are just flexible enough to put the perches and toys on, but not flimsy. The finish looks like a baked on wrought iron finish, a quality look. The doors are easy swing open with hook latch. The sides have plenty of side doors with spring latch. One of the legs had its holes drilled on the wrong side. It is fixable by drilling your own holes, but for now, I cannot attached the bottom shelf. This problem also resulted in me not being able to assemble the cage as directed. The legs on one side bow in a bit. but his could be because the bottom shelf is not there to keep them spread apart and supported. Overall, not the best cage, but fine for the price. Overall very nice cage. Did not give this cage 5 stars because two of the wires arrived unwelded. The food/water dishes are not properly made to attach to the cage. The hangers on the dishes are not spaced correctly for this cage. One of the dishes arrived Crack. They are very cheaply made and I don't see them lasting long. The parts are not labeled as they are referred too in the instructions. It can be assembled by one person but I highly recommend 2 people. This came in many pieces and was somewhat difficult to assemble, but doable.  There were two spots where the welding didn't take and I had to make sure I compensated so the exposed wire wouldn't poke my birds.  My main issue is with the bottom slide out grill and tray.  There are two tracks and the grill should fit on top and then the tray underneath, but the top track is too narrow to fit the grill into, so I had to put that on the bottom track and use the storage shelf to hold the tray for droppings.  This is not an ideal solution and I'm searching to see if there is a grill/cage bottom that will fit that track (ie. I was sent the wrong one) or maybe I can use bedding/wood pellets in the tray and just have that in the track without the grill.  Otherwise, I did give it 4 stars because it is a nice looking cage and is a great price value.  I couldn't get a cage this size for this price anywhere else!  If anyone has any information or helpful hints with the tray issue, please contact me! I can not say enough about this cage..... I put 2 of them together.  My Parrotlets love it and so do I! Perfect! The X-Large one is perfect for my cockatiels and they love it and so do I. The only thing I don't  understand is the fact I bought 3 cages but could not purchase 3 cage covers because they are limited, so I made my own ", "Had this cage for about 2 years and I have only two small complaints revolving around the sheer number of doors and the poorly fitting refuse tray which appears a bit too small.  The fit and finish is quite nice with the hammered metal look remaining attractive.  When I thoroughly clean the cage it looks virtually new.  For small birds and parrots only. My birds love their new home! I'm 5'0 and was able to put it together myself but it definitely wasn't an easy feat. Get a second pair of hands to help you if you can. The instructions were easy to follow, but unfortunately the cage panels weren't labeled. It took a few trial and errors of putting things upside down and inside out before it was assembled correctly. The only good thing about this cage is the rust started in less than 30 days, so I was able to return it. Like many other people said, the side doors are completely useless. Any animal can open them with little to no effort. I had to zip tie them shut. Assembly was a pain in the butt and things didn't line up. The heads of the screws are so soft that just assembling with the provided screwdriver was stripping the head on the screws. This cage is a waste of time and money. I was worried reading reviews of a hard set up. My husband had it up really quick. I did help hold pieces, so I assume that really shaves some set up time off. In fairness, if I had to do it, it would have been forever. I do not do well with diagrams. That is a problem with me though. The actual item is not at fault. It was not difficult to put together by their flaw. First of all, this is a great cage for my conure, and I am really happy to have gotten it at a good price. It is very big, allowing him to climb and play freely. It also has the right bar spacing for him to climb well and not put him in danger, and the bars are thick enough to stand up to his beak (though a larger parrot would have a field day with them). I deducted a star because it was such a beast to put together. You have to fit multiple wires in multiple holes simultaneously, and then hold the whole thing together to put the screws in. I ended up having to zip tie the front piece together to hold it while it was assembled. I have had 5 cages for my Cockatiels as the flock has grown. This one was my favorite, by far! Aside from being difficult to assemble, this cage was great. It was very sturdy for the price, it was easy to clean, the two doors and the \"nest box\" doors made arranging the cage easy. The cage was sturdy enough for me to attach a playgym to the top, heavy branches to the inside, and plenty of platforms. The birds loved this cage, and the flat top was a great place for them to hang out. I bought this July 2012. It has held up well. I have 2 small Conures.  Like other reviews, the side doors  make no sense. We wired them shut, but one of them chewed the wire and here she went, flying around! Cats got freaked out, and the dog was like,, \"coool\" .I have no problem with the food dishes, sometimes I do tho, have trouble getting one end to latch onto the cage, but,  I eventually get it on there. It doesnt bother me. There is a ton of space and the wheels..... I love the wheels! I roll the birds into the back room every night, and then wheel them back into the living room for the day. I believe they love the ride! I got this cage for $94 with a $15 off coupon offered by Amazon. I would buy this again. I absolutely love it as do my sugar gliders! I wish the parts came better labeled, but it wasn't that difficult to assemble. Two people are supposed to assemble it, but I was able to do it by myself in about two hours. I actually got this cage for my two sugar gliders and they absolutely love all of the new space! It arrived quickly and very well packaged. I wasn't concerned in the slightest about any possible damage. The directions call for some pliers to help guide a few of the wires into the holes, but I didn't need them at all- that's how great and easy this way to assemble. I didn't need any of my own tools, it came with everything it needed. At $94, I'll buy this a few more times for my animal fostering. Pros: this is a great deal. Its definitely made cheap, but its still sturdy. Something like this would easily be 300 dollars in a chain pet store, this same model goes for 180$ at my local country max so you are definitely saving some money. I am using it for my juvenile ring neck dove. It could also easily be used for some parakeets, canaries or finches. A larger parrot would definitely break out. Its not necessarily hard to put together but takes some time and is easier if a second person is there to help. definitely would recommend. ", "I recently received this cage for my two parakeets. My husband put it together and he had the same issues that many others have had with the instructions - or lack there of. There were also some bent bars but all in all it didn't take him much time to put it together. Once it was together it was perfect - incredibly large in size, especially for my two birds. You could easily fit four or five parakeets in here comfortably. I don't have experience with other birds, so I'm not sure there. Though I would say any very large or strong bird wouldn't do well. For my birds personally I moved them into this cage from one that was 20 x 16 x 29 inches - so quite a change. They spent the first few days in the same upper corner before eventually starting to branch out and explore. They are still learning their way around and getting used to a new environment, so if your birds seem a little scared at first I would give them time to adjust. Also my girls are just learning to fly and there is plenty of space here for them to do that. Overall an excellent cage for small birds, plenty of room for a variety of perches, toys and flight. Bought this for Olivia, budgie, and to get another one. Thats all, granted the cage can hole 20 birds, but any responsible pet owner would not do that, ...I wanted 2 two to be super comfortable with tons of room. They also have a rope climb to enjoy the top of the cage as well, which is being made into a second play area. The finish on this cage is as pictured. very nice. The top panel of our cage came bent, but we didn't have time to contact the seller as we needed the cage put together asap. The feeding cups are nice but don't fit the cage. The only way they fit is if one of the hanging clips is attached in a door opening. Then the 2nd will fit between the bars. Other wise the hangers aren't spaced correctly for the bar spacing...very inconvenient...not to mention that the doors will not completely close with the food cup hanger in the way :(  The best part of this cage is its size. Otherwise, its just Okay...  ......................................................................................................................... Using this to house a covkatiel.  I would have liked the very bottom shelf to be an inch ur two further from the floor so I could vacuum the area under  it without moving the cage.  The latches on the 2 large doors are very easy to use.  I didn\u2019t realize when I ordered it that it included perches and feed cups, what a nice surprise.  It was a little bit of a challenge to put together for one person but definitely doable. This bird cage was easy to put together once I organized the wire panels on the floor and tried to organize them so that I knew what I had. Following the instructions precisely was the key and there are a couple of steps where it helps to have an extra helping hand to keep the parts from falling down before they are attached with allen screws (Allen wrench was supplied). This is at the beginning of the assembly process. The only glitch was one top wire panel that required drilling two holes, an obvious quality control problem. Once I drilled the two holes on one panel, everything went together smoothly. It took me a total of about 2 hours to organize, assemble and drill. The completed aviary was pure heaven for our two parakeets. They started to fly in it and try out all the perches (which are more like a parrot diameter, but the parakeets quickly adjusted to them). They loved the added space and are extremely happy and thankful! A great product at a great price compared to many others that I looked at. Made in China, unfortunately, but it's hard to find anything made in the U.S. these days. After reading the negative reviews I was a bit weary of buying this, but I decided to anyways. My arthritic 13 year old cockatiel's old cage was too small to put an assortment of perches in. You can't beat the size and price of this cage. I bought this cage for my mother in laws 2 cockatiel birds. The cage is HUGE and definitely a great bargain for the size. It is A lot more reasonable than petsmart/petco and other online places I searched before finding this one. Great for my sugar gliders, came with plenty of food trays and wooden perches, 3doors on each side(spring hinged) and 2doors on the front although the bottom one could be slightly larger to accommodate the wheel since it has to be removed several times weekly to be cleaned.10/17 I now have rust on several places on the cage where the coating has chipped off. There isn't anything I don't like about this flight cage!  And I believe I can speak for my four parakeets too.  Very attractive, because of the bright white wires and very easy to clean compared to the cages I've purchased for my birds.  Great buy!  I am glad that I finally decided to get this. Cage was packaged well. All pieces accounted for. Nothing was bent or broken. While other reviews said directions were hard to follow, I found them fairly easy. The cage definitely requires two people to put together. We had it together in approximately 20 minutes. My only complaint is that the six small doors do not have any latches. So you will need something to keep them closed. We used large binder clips, not the prettiest, but our Mynas also like to play with them. Overall the cage is a great purchase and the birds love it. ", "It is perfect for my growing zebra finch family. The new additions Ham Cheese and Biscuit and parents Wally and Polly just have non stop been chanting in there. I only gave four stars because some of the wires were bent from the delivery. Fortunately, nothing was broken. However, I do see how it could be possible to get completely broken items. Thus, it is a risk but i have never had a problem with returns through Amazon. So be weary! The cage came right on time and in good condition. The finish is very attractive and easy to keep clean. I have had birds for many years and this cage is my favorite. It houses eight parakeets quite well I think. They have lots of room to climb as parakeets like to do, and it was fairly simple to arrange the interior for some flight. I like that it is somewhat lightweight and on wheels so I can easily move it when caring for them. The doors (there are many) are spring loaded so I have wired them shut to prevent them pushing out or being let out by little hands. It takes awhile to put together. My daughter and I spent about an hour figuring it all out and assembling it. Some of the parts don't fit exactly right but you can make adjustments. It comes with 4 large dishes to clip on the bars. It is a little awkward to get them in and out and I always spill the water. I now put the dish in after cleaning and then fill it in place. I certainly like it well enough to consider another for some of my other birds I bought one for my Quaker parrot and I loved it so much that I bought a second one for my cockatiel. There is plenty of room for toys, perches and swings. I used my own bowls because the plastic ones that come with the cage can be easily knocked down by my mischievous birds. Set up isn't too hard, I've put together many birdcage though so that probably helped. I will say that the spring loaded doors on the sides are not very secure. My Quaker is quick to figure out locks and door so I just zip tied them all closed. My only major complaint is the little shelf at the bottom is pretty much useless. It's far too shallow to fit food containers or really anything else. Other than that, it's a great cage and we love it! This was a replacement for a cage that was smaller and literally tried to kill my bird. I just received this today.  I put it together in less than an hour, after getting the very large box open and all the parts separated.  We are very impressed with the size and wish we bought this at least a year ago.  We have seven small'ish birds that we kept in two separate cages.  This cage is quite perfect for all of them together which will reduce our cleaning and maintenance work significantly.  The design is good, there are many doors with which to access the different areas of the cage which is important for a cage this size.  The large tray at the bottom is great for taking in and out to replace the wood shavings.  Overall we are very happy and cannot recommend this product highly enough if you have finches or canaries. I bought this cage for a pair of indian ringnecks. It is very spacious and gives them lots of room to move around. Its easy to clean because both the bottom tray and bottom grate can slide out. The cage was easy to assemble within an hour. I did have to use needle nose pliers to bend the big door latches so that they could be more easily opened. I also had to zip tie shut all of the side doors because they do not close securely and it is very easy for medium size birds like indian ringnecks to figure out how to get out of them! I do wish that the standing height of the cage was taller. The space between the floor and the bottom tray should be taller, or maybe have some type of a sliding mechanism so that people could raise the cage easily. I ended up putting ours on top of a platform to elevate the birds so that they would feel more comfortable going down lower in the cage. Overall this is a great spacious cage for a really reasonable price. Overall, the cage came relatively quickly and I was able to put it together within two hours. I'm sure that if I had someone to help me it wouldve gone a lot smoother and with less hassle than how it went with my petite self. Assembly wise it went well until I had to assemble the very top piece, which when alone can be very time consuming and tricky. However, was easily put together for something so large. The only issue I did have with the cage, and the reason for deducting a star, is that two bars on the cage came bent and was a disappointment. Aside from that, all I had to do extra was zip tie the small easily opened flaps on the side to prevent my Indian Ringneck from opening them which could be dangerous. But an easy fix nonetheless. I love the size and price.  I wouldn't recommend this cage for large birds because the bars are kind of thin, but for my little conures, it is perfect.  I keep this in the livingroom for all 3 of my birds to be in during the day, and they all have their own smaller cages to sleep in at night. Plenty of room for flight and movement with 3 parakeets.  In fact, I could easily fit 2 - 3 more birds in here if I wanted and they would be happy.  I chose NOT to use the grate on the bottom because I didn't want to hurt their feet so we simply slide the tray in that slot and it works perfectly.  My only complaint is that I can't find additional perches to fit the cage. \u2665 We had no problem with the order or even putting the cage together.  However, when we put the black plastic tray in -- it fell out.  It is just staying in the track barely.  The slightest move causes it to fall out.  I do not have time to take it all apart and send it back.  We are adopting a new bird, and getting her Monday.  I would truly like to receive a replacement tray that fits and does not fall out. ", "I love my cage! The cage is amazing! Huge amount of room. We have finches and they love the room! Very sturdy and well made. I def recommend this cage. We r going to breed so we will be having more than 2 but they love it we love it! Came in a few days. The only thing for improvement is the directions nothing was numbered so we puzzled on what goes where. Took about an hr. Everything else was great!!! This thing really wasn't hard to put together until the ceiling- super *fun* to align 5 panels to their corresponding pins at once. Everything else was easy. It's a great buy for the price and mine came without any broken bits. The spring loaded doors are goofy- any critter with half a brain can fiddle its way out. I purposefully installed mine to where the door swings inward. Either way, I recommend adding a latch of some sort (I'm thinking small carabiner clips). I would say this cage is perfect for its price. Good looking and durable metall alloy, nice size for bird (we have a conure), has a shelf for storing stuff, 6 small side spring doors and 2 big locking front doors. I gave 4 star because of: -there is a mistake in instruction so we had to separate and redo the cage during assembling, - thin plastic bottom tray where could be metal one, - 4 plastic feeders kinda look cheap. Some parts were bent causing assembly to be a little tough.  Instructions were hard to follow so we had to figure it out for ourselves.  2 of the dishes that came with cage were cracked and couldn't be used.  There are 4 spring loaded doors (2 on each side) that I had to ziptie shut because the birds could easily push them open and escape.  The cage itself is not very strong and we had to drill holes in the framework in order to assemble.  Once together, it's a good size for my 2 cockatiels and gives them plenty of room to move around but I was expecting better quality. Great cage. Believe it or not, I purchased this for a couple of polish chickens. They are still young and it has gotten a bit cold here in Tennessee. It has space for them to spread their wings and I bought a little deck and added the perches and they are so happy. It did take two people to put together but was not hard at all! Great price! I have two of these cages now for over 6 months. They have more then reached the expectations that we were looking for. The unit is solid. Strong. And easy to move and work with. So many openings into the cage area. Allows you to The cage is big and easy to assemble in about 30 minutes. The only downside is that lovebirds can easyly trow seads outside the cage because feeders are located too high and there is no plastic screen around the bottom of the cage. We had to install a plastic screen around the cage and relocate the feeders near the bottom. There is less mess around the cage now. Cleaning of the cage is easy though. The directions were a joke, there is no way an inexperienced person could understand how to put this cage together. I had to use the directions from someone else on the computer, thank you to them. One of the screw holes was not machined for the screw threads to go into, it was literally impossible so my husband had to find a compatible screw and work to insert it into a hole that had no threads. It is flimsy when trying to move on the rollers. If I had known these problems in advance I would not have purchased it. I did notice on the outside of the box that it was made in china and not the U.S.A. which was a mistake on my behalf.  I love shopping at Amazon but this product simple was not worth the money in my and my husband's opinion. As another reviewer stated, this cage is more wrought iron colored than black. The bars would not stand up to a bird with a big beak, but that is okay since this cage shouldn't be used for that anyways. So, we decided not to clip our parakeets' wings, because birds are supposed to fly, right? We ordered this cage and absolutely love it. ", "Multiple popped welds and 2/4 of the cups were cracked or broken. The item was simple to put together however the different pieces were quite bent and warped so we had to force some things into the right place. Despite this it took me and my husband maybe 20 minutes to put it together. Decent size for the money, the wheels are a plus. Good quality and reasonably easy to assemble.  Plastic tray and one of the feeders were cracked on arrival, but easily fixed with epoxy.  I also wish the perches were a bit shorter to make them removable, we ended up setting them up diagonally.  But overall impression is good, it looks nice, easy to move, easy to clean, and The Bird loves it. I have lost four birds in this cage their wings got through the bars in the corners ,two almost lost their wings, this  carge  is not my cup of tea and will not get this kind again . But all in all looks good love the color green and that it is easy to clean. The feeders aren't the greatest apon opening it one was already broken the other two tabs broke off when I tried to  hook them in place. screws come loose when you move it . The cage is not sturdy, if you are trying to put a Dragon in it. For parakeets this is heaven! This cage is awesome! I almost didn\u2019t buy it because of all the negative reviews about it coming with broken pieces and being hard to put together. The price for a cage this size was just far too appealing to pass up. My five parakeets love this cage and my boyfriend and I are already working on filling it with toys for them to play with. He put it together and reported back that it was relatively easy so maybe they\u2019ve improved since the past reviewers ordered theirs. If you\u2019re on the fence about ordering this cage, go for it! Also all of the food and water dishes came intact. I haven\u2019t checked about the doors that the birds can open themselves but we typically keep the doors open and let them fly all day anyways. CONS:  Included instructions are not helpful. Birdcage need parts to be labeled so you know which part to assemble to which part of the cage. Definitely requires 2 people to assemble, one to hold the cage together and the other to assemble and insert the screws in. The side doors need a latch so that the birds cannot escape if they push against it or if another house pet (ie. cat/dog) is clever enough to open the doors. The bird feeder trays are not easy to attach or remove from the sides of the cage, without the fear of spilling seeds or water all over the place.  You have to attach them very carefully or remove very carefully. The measurements are as noted in the product description, but once assembled it looks much larger than expected. However it fits perfectly in the spot I made for it. We were so pleased with this cage.  My son wanted to give his parakeets room to fly and play, and this is perfect.  I looked at and studied a lot of different cages and decided on this one because it's more cage room than storage.  Some cages are the same dimensions, but the cage portion is a lot smaller for various reasons.  Our goal was more cage room, so this fit our needs.  It was pretty easy to put together and I love that it's a powder-coated finish.  We were also very pleased with the price. Excellent value for the money. This is a really big cage. It will have enough room for about 15 budgies and be completely fine. The build quality is a bit under welming for the price, but still very good. When I recieved mine the package was slightly damaged. Obe of the four feeding troughs were damaged but thats not a big deal for me as I still have three more and the tray that goes in the bottom was cracked bad. I contacted Prevue for a replacement part and under there 90 day warranty they sent me one for free. I just hope that UPS treats this one better. Overall great product and great customer service from Prevue. Will defiantly consider them for any future products. ", "I've had this cage for a month now for my green cheek conure.  Its a nice cage for smaller birds it would be more perfect.  For parrots not so much. So this cage is great for birds I have 3 Budgie and a cockatiel in it and you can put enough food in there where you can leave for at least a one week vacation and not have to worry about anyone looking after your pets. I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you REALLY prepare your cage and know how your birds minds work. I like that the price for this cage was reasonable.  It took two of us to put it together.  There were a few places where the wire was bent which was repairable. I have two little finches in this xtra large cage and it is more cage than they need, so will be putting my two parakeets in the bigger one and finches in the large cage. Package was delivered in a box with reinforced corners to diminish damage. Received package 1 day after placing order. All of the parts were included and well made. Assembly directions were easy to read and it took me about 20 minutes to assemble by myself. Great product well made for the price! I ordered the size large (not the extra large) and I was worried about space, but once I put it together my cockatiel had more than enough space to fly around. You could fit multiple cockatiels in this cage. the side doors are only spring loaded to close so you  may want to put clips or ties on the doors if you have a good size smart bird. You can leave the wire covering the bottom of the cleaning tray on or off. Would definitely recommend this cage, you cant beat the price. I used this for my 3 sugar gliders and they love the space. I put it together by myself in about 45 min. Sturdy construction, close spacing on the bars and it looks great. The only thing that made it better was the price. I have had none of the other problems that I read about with rust, sharp edges, or assembly issues and I've had it for 3 months now. I'm not great with words and don't normally leave reviews, but I'm so pleased with this cage I felt I should. After less than a year the tray wouldn't stay attached and the rickety stand broke making the cage impossible to move to another part of the room without breaking it even more and making the entire cage useless. I had to zip tie the spring doors on the sides shut from the beginning because my parakeets could easily push them open and escape. This was a waste of money. Poor directions, lots of doors that open in a manner a clever bird could get out (light springs are all that hold the side doors shut, we wound up tying those doors closed). I recieved my new bird cage this week and it is wonderful! A great size for the price (saw a similar flight cage in my local bird shop for $365). I only have one cocktail but I feel it would be comfortable for maybe three. The shelf space on the bottom is nice. Sturdy and large enough to place a play set comfortably on top of the cage. Only thing I did not note before my purchase was the small spring doors on the sides. I was concerned they could be easily opened, either by my bird or his kitty house mate. So for safety reasons I attached a quick link to the small doors as pictured above. Overall love my purchase. I liked the fact that there is no lots of room for my birds to fly around in. What I don't like is the way the side doors are, they are spring loaded and (for me) difficult to secure so the birds don't try to get out. Overall, this is a great product and I would recommend it to everyone who has smaller birds, i.e. canaries, parakeets. ", "Most of the time he feels safe... only time he doesnt is when the other furbabies decide to \"visit\". This is why a give it a 5 on sturdiness...it holds up when my silly labradoodle decides his brain is gone runs and jumps at the cage... the doddle is a standard poodle size For price and size, this cage is pretty good. However, the construction is poor. It came with bent bars, and now I have to use a towel over the top to make sure my finches can't get out.  While this cage looks good, it is clearly of an inferior quality. Great size and a good option for small birds like budgies, finches or cockatiels. Anything larger than that and I'd be worried the bird might snap the bars. Good cage for the size but needs to be modified after purchase.  I replaced all the dishes with stainless steel, perches and made better latches for the doors as any bird over the size of a finch can open the side doors and be injured, killed or escape.  I need flight cages and this is the best for the size but not the same quality as their Park Plaza cages which I have 2 of their mediums and would buy more if they made longer in length. Some of the holes for the screws weren\u2019t big enough and I had to file them down so I could attached the sides and back if the cage. Because two of the holes weren\u2019t the right size, they cage didn\u2019t quite fit the way it should and the tray does not fit.  Also, don\u2019t bother reading the assembly instructions, see what the pieces are and put it together because their instructions don\u2019t make the most sense, especially if you have to file down some pieces to make them fit I personaly did not have a problem with shipping and I was able to set it up on my own.  The food dishes were not cracked. My dislikes where that the lock was easy to op thus I would find my sun conure ringing his bell toy on his purch outside of his cage in the middle of the night,  was not to hard to fix with a normal lock. The tray at the bottom sometime falls out when I clean it , only once or twice but not something I go on about too much. Either way I love this cage and my sun conure loves it too. PERFECT! I purchased this last year for my parakeets, I had 4 of them in there and there was room for them to fly and play. Its not completely black, there are spots of silver but it looks better that way in my opinion. The pull out tray makes it easy to clean. Definitely put glass or plastic around the bottom so seeds can't fly out because the food has to be close to the top of the cage. I have to vacuum around the cage twice a day because there is such a big mess. If its your first time owning a bird.....let me tell you they are MESSY. People told me they were and I didn't really believe them until i got my own. They make up for it however with their beautiful singing and bright colors. I sub jest this cage, its big so make sure you have the room for it. We needed a new cage for our quaker. I wanted something big enough to give him plenty of space to play. This cage is perfect...probably bigger than he needs - but exactly what I wanted. I was able to assemble it on my own, it was easy and super sturdy. Very happy with the purchase. My sugar gliders love this cage! It's tall & wide enough for them jump around & play in. There were only 2 things that wasn't the best about the cage & one is there are 3 little doors (total of 6) on each side that can easily be pushed open. I just put a chain link hook in a couple spots to secure the doors though so they don't escape. Second thing is the wheels don't lock in place. Overall I'm really happy about my purchase & it took me about an hour to set up by myself which is not bad at all. Wow so far I love this cage. I have three cockatiels, one pair and one accidental offspring. They love the cage. Now needs to be stocked up with toys to keep them busy. It was really easy to put together. Some parts were bent, but that was expected. It does not compromise the integrity of the cage at all. My birds are happy and I am happy. ", "For $104 I decided not much to lose here. That said.... It took 3 ppl to assemble; the thin metal bends easily so unless you can use hands and feet, prepare for 3 graceful but handy puzzlers at assembly. While contortedly but gently holding the final pieces together we discover we are short a bolt. The instructions stated 16 were included in the box, my son counted 12 needed, but only 11 were present. Perhaps the company only throws in a handful, idk, but it was very unnerving coming up with a temporary solution in the finale of a 3 ring assembly circus. I invest my money to buy this tall bird cage to please my daughter as a surprise gift ... and I am very happy to say it's all worth it!  With the price much under $200 when I bought it, certainly it is quite a better bargain than others that have similar size but cost much higher, and yet still is a decent product for our small parakeets.  Now our 5 small birds (and growing ...) can jump around their cage freely and we can put more toys and decorations inside the cage, and as the result both the birds and my family are a lot more happier ... Great cage for the price.  Take your time putting it together.  As other reviewers have stated, the directions aren't great and the pieces aren't labeled... but if you study the pictures, and have a little common sense, you should be good to go.  Also, when box arrived, the plastic pan was cracked.  Simply called Prevue, and they shipped one out, no questions asked.  received the replacement 2 or 3 days later.  Great customer service, great product. But, the instructions were confusing and I had to figure it out on my own.  Make sure the openings are on one side and the catcher tray is on the same side so you won't have to turn the cage around to pull out the tray...it takes at least 2 people to get it put together.... Cage arrived well packaged.  All parts were included and cage sides/wires were not bent. I assembled it myself. Took about 45 minutes.  I found that putting on the top piece after the sides made it more stable and assembly went quicker.  It wheels around well. I have zebra finches,  they love this cage!! Easy to clean.  Many doors for easy access to inside.  Worth the investment My partner put this together himself in less than an hour (with just a couple of minor struggles). It shipped fast and is a great mansion for our pet cockatiel. It would be a suitable size for a pair, as well. We also have a cat and we were worried when integrating the households that the cat would be...curious...about the bird. While the cage is a little lower to the ground than anticipated, there aren't any gaps in the wires and we're confident that she wouldn't be able to get at him even if she wanted to. Finally, we love that it's lightweight and has wheels so that we can easily bring him room to room with us! Came in a little banged up, but took barely an hour to assemble. Very pleased with my purchase and I bought a used one. Shipping was terrible, but that was moreso UPS. So far my cockatiel loves the extra space and I may need to add another bird. It comes with feeders and perches, but the front door needed instructions to assemble and took me a minute to figure it out. Only issue I really had was that a lot of the pieces were bent, but it was a used cage, so it was expected. Still worth every penny and would recommend. The size is perfect. Instructions are fairly easy to follow. Main thing we had problems with was the side and front panels were missing the predrilled holes where the sides connect. We just used small zip ties to hold the sides of the cage together. It was gonna be to much of a hassle to send it back and have to wait for another cage, we needed it that day. I have one parakeet and she LOVES the space. Her wings are still clipped so I'm waiting to see how well she flys around once her wings grow back. This cage could easily house a conure, cockatials, parakeets, finches, or doves. Kinda hard to assemble but honestly- the product is worth it! \ud83d\ude02 really nice and bigger than I expected. This has exceeded all expectations. The only thing I\u2019m a tad concerned about are the small side doors on either side of the cage. I\u2019m concerned because they don\u2019t have locks on them. If my bird trying to escape I\u2019ll probably use a paperclip to hook the door shut. But otherwise this cage is beautiful! I got the Large size. ", "I love the cage my parakeets love it easy to put together and also great mobility. The only reason i gave a 4 star was the tray, looked like its to small well about half an inch and does not fit the slot. Going to have to modify it. Overall awsome cage I have two cockatiel that now have this flight cage as a new home. This is a very good product for the price. It definitely  is a 2 to 3 person project.  Cleverly designed and as sturdy as one would expect for the price, good for small to medium sized birds. It is definitely not an option for larger bird such as a Parrots or Maccall. I almost didn't buy this cage based on some of the other reviews, but I'm glad I did. My 2 society finches love it! I can't believe how big it is and how much room they have to fly compared to the other smaller flight cage they were previously kept in. If I would have realized how much better and bigger this cage was I would have bought it for them a long time ago. There would be room to house a couple more small birds as well. I was able to put it together in about an hour and a half by myself. It isn't too difficult once you figure out where each piece goes. If you are keeping small finches you might want to buy a couple of additional perches. The perches that come with the cage are much larger in diameter than my birds are used to. first off the up cost is a lot to spend if you want  to get some parakeets. i bought this cage and thought the bird would have a lot of room . which they do. when i got my birds and put them in the cage and the birds toys . they did nothing. probably getting used to the cage. after the nineth day they started to roam the cage. and that made me happy.they are flying around from perch to perch. loving the swing that i got them. sometimes i think they play knock the other parakeet off the swing.its a site to see. my birds are really happy in this cage. As always I was impressed by the excellent service and on time (actually arrived 1 day early) delivery provided by Amazon.  This product exceeded my expectations in every way for its price.  I am extremely pleased with this products quality.  The cage is made of high quality very durable cage wire, and its frame is very sturdy and solid with excellent connections.  It is well designed for easy access to various parts of the cage with multiple access doors.  It has large fly through cage doors in front for my parakeets who are granted free range in my apartment all day so they can fly in and out easily.  My parakeets are in 7th heaven with this cage and have become MUCH more active than before when they were in a much smaller cage. This is a very nice cage for the money. My two sun conures love it in here and there is plenty of space for both their beds, toys and more to come! I would cautiously build the cage to make sure everything is in the right spot, but all in all a very good product. Other reviews may make you nervous to buy and honestly I wish I bought sooner! 10/10 would recommend for small-medium hookbills and parakeets. Only thing is I zip tied the spring doors on the side to eliminate any chance of them getting out or hurt. For parakeets i would recommend putting newspaper on the bottom so their feet don\u2019t fall through. No dents. No missing screws. In tact and only took me an hour to build with my brother! I would recommend at least one other person to help you build it. I\u2019m 19 and I built this on my own. It took roughly an hour maybe an hour and a half because I was struggling to hold up all of the pieces while trying to put the screws in place. Definitely recommend second pair of hands. It\u2019s really good quality though. Although I messed up the assembly by put the pullout tray thing on the opposite side, now I have to flip my cage just to pull out the tray so that sucks big time. Lots of space and the babies love it!! For the price of a good, big cage, you do need to assemble it yourself. However, it isn't hard if you're somewhat handy. Put it together myself in a couple of hours (probably would have taken less time with a helper). It's sturdy and easy to move on its wheels. It might be tricky at first, if you're not making sure all the wires align, and it is definitely a loud process to put together, but it's quite large and durable. There's a lots of room in there, and will make my parakeets happy to flutter around freely. A great value for a roomy flight cage,  well built, nicely finished.  The package came complete with all necessary hardware, the welding and finishing seem done with care. This is a very high quality cage. My birds and I both love it, and I couldn't be happier with the cage itself. It's a little tricky to put together, I would definitely recommend two people or more on this project, because I don't think I could have done it on my own. What I'm not so happy with, however, are the cheap plastic bowls that come with the cage, one of which came broken after shipping, the other broke after trying to put it on the cage. Luckily it comes with 4, but none of them really fit anywhere but the one location they're meant to. Plus, if you have anything larger than a budgie/parakeet, I would recommend getting stainless steel bowls, because any larger bird would shred these ones almost immediately. ", "Parts were bent, but I worked it out. The wire is very thin, so best for parakeet (budgie) or finch types. But my Max Pionus doesn't pick at or bend bars, so she's fine in it. Other parrots might bend the bars or easily escape. So far, so good! We've only had the cage for a few days, but our finches love it. Assembly wasn't too bad for 2 of us -  had it only been 1 person, it would be a much different story. We put it together in about 30 minutes, but by yourself, I could see it taking 2 hours! There was 1 broken weld on the back panel, but we zip tied that. The small doors leave a lot to be desired and they're the reason for the 4 star review. Our no-mess feeder would not work with the side doors, so now that is on the inside. Other than the size of the doors, they do create great access points. The perches that come with the cage are not great either. They're a little long and hard to place - plus, they're way too big around for little birds (the kind of bird this cage is designed for).We did leave them in the cage, but added our own perches too. This gives them a good variety for perch size and is better for their feet. Bar spacing is good too. I was trying to find 3/8\" spacing, but the 1/2\" spacing still keeps the cat paws out and the birds in. As of now, we have been rolling this from the livingroom to a secure place for the birds overnight, until we are comfortable with the cats and the cage. We have had no problems rolling the cage and it has not tried to fall apart as other reviewers have mentioned. Just be sure to tighten the screws. Overall, we are pleased with this cage and would buy it again. We bought this for our sugar gliders. It was fairly easy to put together. One person may be able to do it but a second person just to help hold the pieces in place is a big help.  It comes with 2 large doors on front that have slide locks.  It also has multiple spring load doors for access but we just zip tied them closed and ours pay no attention to the zip ties.  The front doors are plenty big enough to get most any toys you would want in the cage.  Not steady enough for kids to climb on, would easy bend if to much weight is placed on shelf, such as putting foot on it.  Has wheels so easy to move around the room. Package arrived on time and was described correctly by seller as a little damaged to the box.  However everything was fine inside and I was able to unpack it and put it together.  It was a little out of shape but I was able to bend the wires to fit in each slot now the birds can fly around the cage and seem to like it.  It was very noisey this morning.  Doors are nice and placed all over the cage but the side doors may have to be secured with ties because if they discover they can push them open with their little heads they will get out and fly everywhere in the house.  We learned not to underestimate them.  Very happy with product. While this cage did take two people to assemble, it was very simple. A lot more simple than the similar Critter Nation cage I had previously. The price is reasonable. The cage seems sturdy. I don't care for the bowls it came with but I already had some so no big deal, there. The package was very securely packaged and came promptly. Description says it comes with 4 seed cups, mine came with 2. Photograph shows 4 of them.  Also, the hooks in the molded plastic seed troughs do not align with the bars of the cage, so I used the food cups that I recently bought for the other cage, and they work fine. This is the seed cup listing for what I bought: I love how much room this cage has for birds. Plenty of room for true flight for your birds. I add greenery, moss, and natural branches to make the cage beautiful. I don't think you could do this with hook bills, but it works wonderfully with canaries and finches. The cage is large enough to allow the canaries and finches to breed with no aggression. My only \"complaint\" is the legs should be much longer. The cage sits too low to the ground ( I have 3 ferrets ), so I had to buy a low profile coffee table that works great. This cage is a good deal for the money ! This cage is a great cage for the money. It took me, my daughter and my 7 yr. old granddaughter about 40 minutes to put it together. You will definitely need an extra pair of hands to stabilize it. I have two parakeets in it, and they love it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the dowel perches are too big for my parakeets. They are 1 inch. I wish there was an option to order the perches in different sizes. I just went to Lowes and bought 1/2 in. dowels, cut them down to 31.5 inches and notched the ends. I paid about $6 to replace the perches. I also had an issue making the food dishes fit. But I prefer water silos and stainless steel bowls, so it wasn't really that big of a deal. Good size and quality for the price. Two of 4 trays came in broken and cracked though. No need for all side doors with weak springs. Used the hook trays to keep them locked. Easy 1 man assembly. Came with the Allen wrench, used a rubber mallet to tap some parts down that wa tight. Concised and easy to follow instructions. Careful on those tack weld also, easy to break (rookie job). I have to tie wrap on two sections.... so far. I put the entire cage together by myself.  I am not good at these things but the instructions were perfectly clear and easy to follow.  My husband was pleasantly surprise that I was able to put the entire cage together by myself.  My eclectus parrot loves it.  There was only one bent bar and I was able to fix it.  All other parts were perfect.  I would definetly recommend this product to others. ", "I am very pleased with this cage.  I bought the extra large size for my tame house sparrow as a home, not a confining \"cage\".  He comes out to fly and eat dinner with us regularly, but on those days he can't come out, he needed a home large enough for flight, toys, food and veggies, and his nest tent.  The cage went together easily with two people, but we have a bit of experience putting bird cages together.  Ours doesn't have any issues except one of the hang on bowl's hooks is broken.  I'm not using them so... meh. Arrived with all pieces, but the metal was shaped such that it is impossible to get all of the holes lined up to fasten. I contacted the customer service email provided in the box, and have received no response from Prevue in a months time. I bought this cage for my four finches and it has worked wonderfully. It offers plenty of room for them to fly. OMG I love this flight cage it is perfect for my Quaker Parrot. Was very easy to put together and it was awesome that no parts were missing. Previously purchased a cage before this one and that was a disaster. I am so happy this manufacture had easy to read instructions and all parts were included. I love this cage! Has changed the birdies lives since i took them out of the tiny starter cage they were gifted in. They are more active and even spend a couple of minutes a day flying from side to side for fun. For those wanting to double up on the gages. I made mine taller instead of wider. Easy to fit together ended up with one extra top and the legs and 2 bottom panels. Also gives me an extra bottom tray for when the first one gets to old. I had to cut off 4 of the nubs things in pic 2 and added 4 small mending plates I found at Walmart for .79.  Took about 1 hour and 1 helper.  I already had the one cage so the 1 hour is just for retro fitting the 2nd cage to the first.  Basically you just make the 2nd cage without the bottom legs and base. And you take the top off the first cage and attach them. Good luck. I love these cages This company has no quality control. Another cheap Chinese product. To keep my birds from using the side doors to fly out I had to bend paper clips around them. Some of the screw holes don't line up and had to due without, luckily enough holes lined up to keep it together. My birds have plenty of room to fly around now. I love the cage overall.  I use it for my rats and not for birds as it was intended, but they have lots of room to run around and play, and I have plenty of room to hang toys and chews and stuff for them.  It is however incredibly difficult to put together.  A friend and I managed to put it together but it probably would have gone better with three people instead of just the two of us.  Also the pan at the bottom doesn't fit right.  Its a bit small for the cage, all the space is covered so there is no extra mess but its hard to get it to stay where it is suppose to sit.  One corner or another always seems to want to fall out.  That is something that with some effort I've managed to deal with, but it is a pain to have to mess with it every time I clean cages. This cage is huge! Perfect for 4 budgies. Likely can fit 6 Show (English) Budgies. Or can fit a couple tiels or conjures. I am very happy with this cage!  Luckily, my husband had it put together before I even got home, so I can't speak to assembly, but it is VERY sturdy and well-made.  I was looking at cages in a national pet store chain the day before this came, saw one I really liked because it was exactly what I wanted, but it was $229.  When I got home -- well, if this isn't the exact same cage, it's close! ", "I love everything about this cage it is very sturdyeverything screws in keeping all pieces together tightly it's well made smooth all pieces so my babies can not be injured. I am 74 years old never put a bird cage together before had mo problem. very good instructions step by step numbered with a picture.all screws the same size.this cage is excellent quality worth $300.00 I will buy from this company again.my birds were so happy they were singing away in 24  hours Thank you Amazon After reading some of the reviews I was iffy on how this product would come in. One of the brackets was broken (I do not know which one because my husband put it together and said I would never find it.) Some of the bar sheets are a little bent. Not anything you can't fix. When putting on a perch I broke a bar, just at the weld but that is because this cage is for small/medium birds and I was pushing on it my husband said to just put it back where it was welded and leave it alone. I love the doors, the food dishes are hard to get on, but they have perches attached and well easy to go on means easy to get off for the birds. My finches love their new home, I put newspaper at the bottom because finches love to eat off the ground and I wanted to make sure they could. The pull out cage bottom (not the tray) is not a pull out but a wrench out. Way to difficult so my husband will be taking it out for me. Putting it together is difficult (according to my husband) he said nothing was labeled but on the directions they were. But I knew that, remember use common sense. The bars are not as sturdy as the other cage I have, but the other cage is for a larger bird. I adore this cage, although it has it's flaws it is a good looking cage and I would recommend you get it. The doors are plenty strong enough for small/medium birds and I do not see them escaping, although if you have a cat you may want to find other means to keep them closed. The front doors bar is a little difficult to line up, but it just takes a little pressure and you can get it in there. Most of the negative reviews are true, although I find they may have expected a perfect cage which as we all know perfection does not exist, and some of them over exxagarated the flaw. It is not at all bad! I got this for my quaker parrot when he outgrew his baby cage. This thing is huge! I probably could've gotten the smaller size but he loves it. The metal was bent a little which made assembly a little difficult but overall love it! Long story short I really needed to have this together in time only to find out the hard way that part B2 was missing and was not included in my order. B2 is the entire back part of the top back half of the cage. Without it you can't finish the cage. Love the new cage once put together it's solid and sturdy. Had all the parts nothing was bent or broken glad I got this one and my birds love it one moment there up top the next there on the bottom didn't use wire bottom birds like to play with news paper on bottom I just change every day or two I love the mobility about it, i love the height of it,  i love the width of it, want to order another, but hubby says no and H---,No, i hate that it took 2 hours in total  time, but 3 days to complete because the  Frustration, Pain in the as-, The cussing, At the cage and at each other was not fun putting together. The feeder cup doesnt fit well, but now that it is built i love it and so does the my birds This is nice size cage however it was built poorly - had to drill holes to make it go together correctly- also would be nice if they would label the parts so it would be easier to figure out how it all goes together- someone who maybe doesn\u2019t have tools to fix the issues would be returning the cage. Not sure how cage made it through inspection The cage came in great condition, fairly easy to set up, we have 4 parakeets and they love their new enclosure. Plenty of space for them. I gave this 4 stars because 2 of the 4 dishes came broken and amazon will not just replace those 2 dishes but would replace the whole cage, dishes, etc. It isnt worth the hassle to take down this cage down that my birds are already settled in for 2 dishes. Im disappointed that replacement parts arent available but happy with the cage and feel like its worth the money! Great product even greater price! Perfect for my two sugar gliders. Plenty of room to set up toys and branches. Easy access to food and easy to keep clean. Excellent value for the money! I would have expected to pay almost triple for what I received! I got an even better deal because I purchased from the warehouse. a cool cage for such a price, it\u2019s easy to assemble, disassemble, when moving it can be sorted out by folding it into its own box, I absolutely recommend it, I am not a friend or relative of this seller, I just like to tell the truth what it is! Thank you guys for the goods and for the accurate delivery, the goods reached in general and safety! ", "I LOVE this cage....economical, and a great value for the price.  I Love that it has so many doors...Since it\u2019s so big, having the 2 big doors as well as 8 smaller doors makes cleaning and setting up a breeze!  I would highly recommend Ultimately, this cage has been great! What a great value for this cage. The breeder wanted twice this amount. I love all the doors. My conure stays at the top but I feel better with him having such a big cage. It rolls easy and comes with everything needed to get your bird's home ready..just add some toys. Very happy with the spacing as well. He stays safe and secure. Back story: I acquired a Sun Conure (named Calvin Edwin Ripken III) after a friend found him released in her apartment complex and his cage at the dumpster. It was a nice cage, so we took it, cleaned it up and put some new toys in it for him. However, he still seemed a little unhappy, so my boyfriend and I decided to start looking for a new cage for the boy. I just got my first of the two cages, hell yea! this was a very good buy in my opinion.  The cages are incredibly sturdy and quite large! for the price this would be the best product i could ever tell someone about.  i have two pairs of sugar gliders that are going in them and the first of the two are extremely happy in their new home.  I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE! Purchased this item with high hopes for a new enclosure for my Sugar Gliders. But sadly this cage did not meet my expectations. The bars are very flimsy. My SG was able to bend them and get out. These are juvi SG 2.. so maybe 3oz.. Second it says that its 1/2\u201d spacing. Which holds through for the bars themselves but in the corners have a 3/4 or greater gap which is plenty for a SG to get out. Very disappointed in the overall quality. We are contacting the seller today. None I have several finches, and purchased two of these cages; the first was a real bargain at only $100, but the next one was $135....saw it for $120 the day after it was ordered, but they would not give me that price. That was a bummer. But, the cages are great, and easily assembled; they look nice. One improvement would be to have a smaller slide opening within the front door of the cage....I am nervous about opening the door all the way.....the door comes in handy sometimes, but for changing food, etc., a slider would be better. The side doors are helpful. I even separated one of the cages into two sections by cutting a piece of cardboard and cutting in notches and then slid it into place. It worked....needed to separate some birds at the time, but using it as one again. Surprisingly sturdy and good looking for the price. I received this cage and assembled it a couple days ago. I wanted a larger cage for our finches. This shipment was packaged well and received with no damage. All of the parts were there. The instructions could use a little more detail on identifying the components, but it really was not hard to put together. Took me around 40 minutes.This is a large cage, but its light; which is good for me because I move it out to the patio and back into the house a lot. I really like this cage. It's very roomy in both width and depth. I currently have 2 Green Cheek Conures housed in it which will hopefully breed in the Spring. That will put me at six or so birds. There will still be a good amount of room. ", "I\u2019ve read reviews, some say it was hard to put together, I didn\u2019t think so for it is a big bird cage you will probably need a extra set of hands.. Wow, really happy with this cage! Although I wouldn't describe this as a true white (it's more of an off white color - I included a photo showing it against the white trim in my house for comparison) I'm still very happy with the purchase. I got this for my parrotlet, and while he's had a nicely sized cage for years, I have always felt badly that he didn't have a larger one to enjoy for the times when he can't be outside of his cage (and it can be tough to find large cages with appropriate 1/2\" bar spacing or less). He LOVES his new digs though I think I'll need to get him a few more toys now to help furnish his space a bit more! (It's such a large space for him - he looks as though he's got his own personal apartment building and this makes us both beyond happy!!) This is a fantastic birdcage for the money.  Cages sold in big box stores are a similar price, but a tiny fraction of the size.  Seriously, this cage is huge and I love it.  I've noticed that other reviews complained that assembly instructions were not included, but I did get instructions with mine.  The only thing I would like to see improved are the doors on the front of the cage.  They're a bit small, and the sliders stick a little, causing the cage to jostle (startling the birds) when opened.  Otherwise, amazing cage for a great price!! Bars are very thin and flimsy and bend easily.  In fact one bar was bent when we unpacked it.  We did not assemble it at that point and decided to return it.  Unfortunately, we missed the return window by one day.  Door opening is very wide, but a clever mid-sized parrot can easily figure out how to open it.  I would never use as a cage for unsupervised use due to quality and possibility of escape.  We did not assemble it at that point and decided to return it.  Unfortunately, we missed the return window by one day. These give a good amount of room, easy to move around if needed, and easy to clean. Plus the price is extremely reasonable! Lots of doors to access the inside. My only teeny complaint would be that they must come from different manufacturers and some cages have better door latches than others. I bought 2 and one has a wonderful secure latch and one has a difficult latch. This would not stop me from ordering though because the good outweighs this feature. This is great for the price. Sure I may not have much experience, but for what you pay for, you sure get a lot! The cage is made very flimsy. The weld points don\u2019t hold up at all. Some literally broke during installation. The cage also came bent, they quickly shipped me out another one but that was also the same so I returned it. Got this cage for an awesome price.  And all of Prevue's products are awesome.  Only one tiny complaint.  As these cages are mass made, they are not always perfect.  I've worked in pet stores, and owned birds for years.  So I have put together my fair share of Prevue cages.  And every once in a while, you come across one that just doesn't quite fit exactly together the right way.  On this one, there is one screw that will just NOT go in all the way.  But the cage is still sturdy enough and safe enough for my budgies, so it's fine.  I definitely recommend all of Prevue's products. Love this cage. I have 2 budgies and I might get two more. I got the XL. I put it together by myself in less than an hour. Used twist tied to temp hold pieces so didn't need and extra set of hands. Easy to assemble. All the parts were in good condition. Nothing broken or bent. Such a great bargain! We're very happy with this cage (bought for a nanday conure). Solid construction, nice finish, lots of utility. Some blobby welds and other glitches, but the finished cage is handsome. Now we're working on the feng shui. :) ", "The cage is very roomy and nice quality. I would have given it a 5 star if it was about 10\" higher from the floor. I have a dog and my canary is a bit scared to come down to his bath when she is around. I have another cage that is higher up and the birds don't seem to mind the dog walking by. The packaging was fine. All the pieces came in good shape. I've had a great experience with this cage.  Been using it for 3 years now, it houses one cockatiel.  My favorite feature is the ease of rolling it around, as I move it from room to room daily, multiple times a day.  Very easy to clean as well, and has been very secure.  I've had cats on occasion jump on the cage on the side and hang there, and have had them on top of the cage, and the cage has always held up to that stress. I'd highly recommend it. I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet. I just got a single bird at the moment, moved him from a really small cage into this MASSIVE cage. It was awesome, because at first he didn't know what to think!!! He had all this room to do what ever he want plus a new little nest box I bought for him. I am very satisfied that my bird is satisfied. This cage could hold quit a few birds and nests for them all. I plan to get my bird a buddy soon to play with and make lots of noise with hahaha!! Also this is a quality cage, I thought it would be flimsy and what not but that's not the case. The dogs liked to jump up at first but they got over it when they couldn't get in, although if you got a big aggresive dog he might be able to pull it down if he is smart. I got a couple min-pins and a chuauauaua I can even spell it lol. GREAT PRICE, GREAT BUY, YOUR BIRD(S) WILL BE HAPPY! This cage is very sturdy and a great size for my 3 parakeets and 1 canary.  It was easy to put together, nothing was bent.  I like the spring-held doors, I don't think a small bird could possibly open them. The front doors are very easy to open and latch securely. I do wish the cage's legs were about 5 inches longer, but that's my only complaint. I was a bit unsure with this type of purchase as to quality and ease of assembly. I am happy to say that it was an absolute steal at the price. The packaging was very reliable with corner protection and lots of padding to protect during shipment. I house my Lady Gouldian finches in this and it\u2019s great. Plenty of room to fly and to attach perches. The spring doors would be pretty easy to open for larger or more curious birds, so that\u2019s a note of caution. On the up side, they are very handy for moving things around and getting feeding trays in and out. Assembly instructions were easy to follow and while I did most of it by myself, my husband helped when I needed something stabilized until I could get the screws attached. I would buy another down the road if my flock grows. My bird loves his new space! Great quality for a reasonable price So it\u2019s big and pretty nice. Using for my ratties. Problem is- broken tray, smashed perches and broken water/food trays. Called amazon and they gave us a VERY small discount. I didn\u2019t  want to disassemble so I took it. I really wish they would have just sent us a new bottom tray. I could have lived without the perch and other trays. Just hate paying this price and now I have duct tape all over it : (. My cage came very quickly since I have prime membership. It arrive two business days after I bought it. I was pretty ill with a cold but decided that my sugar gliders deserved to have fun in their new cage, so I assembled it that night. I almost gave up three separate times, but I managed to assemble it by myself in a few hours. Some of the bars did need to be bent in order to fit correctly, which it mentions in the instructions. Aside from that, assembling the cage was fairly straightforward. Would've been tons easier having someone hold the opposite side steady while I worked on it, since this cage could technically fit me inside it. I'm very happy with my purchase and my gliders love their new home. ", "All the reviews warn of missing pieces & horrible instructions.  TRUE!!!  2 of the 4 food/water bowls were broken.  The instructions were nearly useless as the parts did not have ANY corresponding labels.  In the end, I have a decent birdcage (w lopsided supports as I was trying match pix to the piece), 2 feeders, a slide out cleaning tray in the back, instead of the front. It took some time to put together but the assembly over all wasn't too bad. The build quality is pretty good but there were a few pieces that I had to bend back into shape with pliers luckily nothing dangerous for the birds so I went a head and kept the cage. The head of the screws also seems to strip easily and the hex tool they send with it also tends to strip even when you are not applying that much pressure. Despite all these defects, the cage is better than any cage I have seen from a main stream pet store. Like so many others, I think this cage is a terrific bargain.  It's hard to find an affordable cage this large, with this bar spacing (for small birds), at such a low price.  I have 4 budgies in mine, 2 small American budgies, a very large English budgie, and an English/American cross and there is ample room for more birds.  The convenience of the large front doors, coupled with the smaller spring-loaded side doors makes cleaning,changing food stations,and hanging toys very easy.  It is pretty good quality although even though it's on wheels, I won't be wheeling it around much. When it moves, it tends to bow a little on it's frame. My birds love it and use all the space inside- even the low areas, since it's easy to set up enticing toys down low as well as up high.We purchased a wooden ladder for about $5 that we have place on the bottom door, so when it's open, the birds with clipped wings can come and go as they please, but they like it so much, they rarely are interested in coming out. Prior to getting this cage, our birds were paired up in two smaller cages. We had two that didn't get along at all, but they are cohabiting peacefully now as there is plenty of room to stay out of each other's way. Highly recommend. Easy to assemble. Love the look and feel of the paint. Received it with a small missing piece, but contacted the manufacturer directly and they were nice enough to send it to me and save me the trouble of taking it apart, return it, and order another one. It\u2019s a nice cage for small birds.  I have two parakeets and they enjoy the large space.  It is not easy to put together (you need a helper) and it seems a bit flimsy.  You definitely would not put a bird in it that chews a lot or is very clever.  I think they might figure out how to get out.  For my needs it was perfect and the prices was right. I love this cage.  It is exactly as I expected and was very easy to assemble with the instructions.  It came quickly with no damage.  I liked it so much I purchased a second one, took out the side panels on both, and connected them with cable ties to create one huge flight cage for my pair of ringneck doves.  It is still easy to move to vacuum around.  I removed the bottom grate and put the tray in its slot so that my birds are on a solid surface.  One thing of note: the bars on the cage are flimsy and would probably not stand up to a strong beak/strong chewer. I've been a rat owner for a little over a year.  I've been through two cages in that time. I just got this cage yesterday since it was more ideal for my bedroom. It fit perfectly into the corner where I usually keep my cages at. the cage came decently packaged in a some what heavy box, it had the corners of the box guarded by additional cardboard. Each of the cage parts were wrapped individually in thin plastic, even though I'd recommend using bubble wrap in addition to the thin plastic in your boxes next time Prevue, it would make more sense. Nothing came broken, which I was surprised with the lack of cushion inside.  It came with instructions, but they didn't make too much sense because the images were small. Without the instructions it took me about 30 minutes to assemble. The cage is somewhat flimsy in structure when you want to move it around. Mine came with only two minor blemishes. one minor (rust?) spot and a weak weld on the stand. Even though I'm not using it for birds, on of the feeder doors won't even open, it seems to be welded shut(saved me a zip tie at least.) I would give this ten stars if I could. It does take two smart people to build though! Probably twenty minutes. Needs to have individual pieces marked so you don't have to keep taking it apart when you put the piece in wrong place! My finches love it! It's tall and rolls around easily to move and clean around. And $ is so reasonable! This cage is great!! Our sugar gliders love it. We get up in the middle of the night and sugar gliders are bouncing all around. However, the plastic food dishes are kind of cheap. We broke ours trying to put them in the actual cage. Its nice that you get a few with the cage. The cage arrived on time and on perfect condition. All parts were there and the instructions were self explanatory. It is easier for two people to put together and took about 46 minutes. No warping, no sharp edges, no kidding hardware. I am very happy. ", "Short Version: This cage is very well built, inexpensive, and to my delight, it has removable end panels so that two cages (or more can be added) can be joined together easily and nearly seamlessly by using black plastic cable ties and omitting one set of wheels at the join to create a six foot flight cage. I ended up buying three of these cages. The third, I lashed to the front of the second at right angles.  By not adding the end panels of the third cage at the end to be joined, and leaving the large front cage doors of the second cage opened, it adds another three feet of flight space, beautifully fits the corner of my room, is visually more interesting to look at, and is a big hit with my Finches offering them more flight path variety and interest. Easy to assemble. Did all by myself. Didn't need a 2nd person. Very sturdy. Just becareful not to strip any bolts with the allen wrench. Only comes with 1 extra bolt. Don't ober tighten. Just enough where it's snugged. Good quality. My birds loved it. Only have 2 at the moment. Buying 3 more soon! Great birdcage BUT the bottom of the cage is too big for cat to reach for bird's tail and wing. Don't ask. I am telling for those who have cat that this cage isn't 100% cat proof. If you put a thin chicken wire in the bottom, you have a better safety protection. The plastic tray melts VERY easily. Woop! The electric heater melted it! I did lots of research before buying this cage. It's the perfect size for my pair of indian ringnecks. You can attach a nest box, I just zip tied back the feeder door. You do need to secure all the feeder doors, as they can easily open them. I zip tied the ones I won't use often and got small clips for the others. My Lovies are comfy in it. I had an issue assembling it. There was one hole that did not match up so I couldn\u2019t put a screw in it. I tried explaining it to amazon but they said I would have to send the whole cage back to company. It weighs a lot so I decided to improvise. Otherwise i would give 5 stars... Awesome cage, easy to open doors and plenty of them.  Wasn't hard to assemble either..but I've assembled a few birdcages before this.  More than adequate room for my little flock of 6 budgerigars.  My only wish is that the wheels were a bit bigger/more heavy duty..but the wheels it comes with are technically just fine, so it's not worth docking a star. After the hurricane in Florida, we ended up with 3 baby squirrels and their eyes were not yet open.  We purchased this cage for them as we knew that they would eventually start running around.  We loved it and so did they.  They are now out in the big trees, but come back for petting and a good scratch. Alright I've had this cage long enough to say I love it. Assembling wasn't difficult but it did need two people for one part of the assembling. My lovebird enjoys the cage as he now has so much room for all sorts of toys. At night he goes in and sleeps I don't have to coax him in. The bars can be a bit flimsy but they aren't bad. I also wheel the cage at night to another room and the wheels havent failed me yet. Really need two people to assemble. ", "So... To be honest, I don't use this cage, it was a present. I can tell you about their experience, however. This Is an excellent, attractive, lightweight but roomy cage for one or more small to medium birds  at a remarkably reasonable price.  My husband and I just finished putting it together this morning.  The instructions were well written and illustrated, and we had no problems with assembly.  The materials seem top quality.  We have a Hahn's Macaw, who took to the cage almost immediately.  Bird and owners very satisfied. I purchased this cage to upgrade my birds to a new one and to make it easier for me to clean. It\u2019s worth what I paid. However, the instructions weren\u2019t clear and parts weren\u2019t labeled. So we installed some panels backwards and had to restart. A wire piece was not cut out properly so we had to take some wire cutters and fix that. The bowls arrived damaged, so this cage can be a hit or miss. My prevue hendryx black flight cage came with several snapped bars a very cracked/broken plastic tray and 2 broken food/water dishes, i would very much appreciate a replacement flight cage please. Very good cage for the price. We a little concerned about the doors and might buy latches to make sure they stay closed. The side doors make feeding and watering is a breeze but we had to watch the placement of some accessories due to those doors. Our parakeet love to fly around in it and have been very happy with it.  All in all we are very happy with it. I bought this for my cockatiel, just because his cage was over 20 years old, and it was the same price as the tiny ones the pet store was selling.  Once I put him in it, I thought \"overkill, it's TOO much room\".  It looked like he was living in an empty castle.  I put in some branches and toys, and now it's not too bad, but he will never see the bottom half of this cage.  But if you have finches or parakeets that move around a lot, that bottom half is even more valuable. The top cover came in bent, one of the screws had no place to use an Allen wrench. Putting it together was not the best of experiences. I need another cage but I doubt I'll be buying this same one again. I would not recommend it. Too much money for the stress of having to fix these things on my own Excellent cage! Easy to assemble and provides so much room!! Using it as an outside cage for my panther chameleon! He loves it! Only drawback is the little doors which don\u2019t have locks on them so we just put breadties on them. The cage over all is grate. However the quality control is not there. The legs have 3 holes on the top to lock in extended  cage wires. One of the legs I receives had the holes on the side so I had to drill holes on the top. Also a few of the bolt holes were not tapped correctly so it took added time to get the cage together. If you plane on using it for a larger bird @ a small parrot you need to secure the side doors as they can be pushed open with out to mush pressure. I have 4 parakeets and this is more than big enough. I even put it together all by myself, and that\u2019s saying something. I love that I can wheel the cage around and even take it outside if I want to. ", "My cockatiel loves this cage. I have never kept her in a cage before. She had free roam in my Florida room for 10 years. I got tired of cleaning poop every weekend! So I bought this for her and she loves it. I purchased this for my budgie (parakeet), and I really like it.  It was really hard to put together, but I guess that means its durable! A tad flimsy and has some bends in the wire but I really like this cage and would buy again if needed,. I have 2 cockatiels in it and there is plenty of space for them, toys, and perches. My husband and I put up the cage. Couldn't figure out one piece in particular that took us half hour to figure out which piece it was. The birds love the cage and I am very satisified with it. It did come with a couple of bent pieces which I am sure is from shipping but it was easy to bend it back to shape. THe birds totally enjoy climbing up and down. They visit the cat down at the bottom and go back to the top for feeding and playing. Lots of toys in the cage and I do not have to worry about all the toys getting dirty so fast. Very roomy and they fly around a bit in the cage. I have two cockatiels and one parakeet in the cage. I've had this cage for a year and eight months.  I like it; my birds (two parakeets and a dove) like it.  I might even get another one.  There are a couple of things you might want to know.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can't change the seed and water cups without opening the doors and reaching inside the cage.  This could entail a slight risk of a bird escaping, although this hasn't happened to me.  After a lot of use the plastic tray at the bottom became warped and would know longer stay in place.  I took it out and cut a piece of artificial turf and put it in the bottom of the cage.  This isn't a wholly satisfactory fix. We picked up this cage for our Sugar Gliders and I can't say there's anything I'd change. We have used this cage for a few weeks.  Moving it (rolling it) from wood floors to tile throughout the day.  Stays together and moves easily.  Perfect for our Parakeet, plenty of room to fly around I bought two parakeets in January and noticed they didn't seem happy in their cage. So I went bigger. They LOVE this! They fly and play and sing, they love it. It's huge and has room for almost 4 or 5 comfortable parakeets I'd say. I'm buying another parakeet tomorrow. One of the pictures shows more than 4 but I want mine to have lots of room.You will need 2 people to put this together. One person to hold it in place and the other to put the screws in place. It took me and my mom about an hour to put it together. Maybe less. It's very stable. I also love how easily the tray comes out to clean the cage. Good buy! Well worth the price. This is a great cage!  So inexpensive for the high quality materials.  Construction was easy (I did it alone with very little trouble) and the cage is not only very attractive and sturdy-looking, but is also sooooo much easier to keep clean than the old cage my lovebirds had.  Before, they were basically so close to the edges of the cage that food was always spilling out onto my floor and the sides of the cage would get pooped on.  It was considered an average cage for 2 lovebirds, too.  This cage, however, seems to be a MUCH more reasonable size for them.  It stays so much cleaner because they aren't cramped into such small quarters.  It probably also helps that it's lower than the old cage, so the inevitably messy bottom of the cage (even one hour after I've cleaned it, the cage bottom looks atrocious because of all the scattered seeds and poop and paper that my little girl shreds as soon as I replace it) is almost too low to be noticeable.  I love the size and construction of this cage and the food trays that come with it are really nice and sturdy.  Can't say enough about the quality of this cage, especially for the price.  The birds have SO much room to spread out!  It's so nice to see them actually fly a little and to be able to fully spread their wings both at the same time.  Seeing my happy birds chirping away in their new space makes me happy :) I Have nothing to complain, but you will need extra hand to assemble, but pretty easy to put together after that you will have this nice,spacious cage for my finches, they love it very much without a doubt! I added a house plants around it, OMG no word is needed!!! ", "I'm wondering what else I could use this cage for. It's really big and I'm going to use it for finches, but I think it would work well for conures too. Maybe it could be modified to fit a ferret or even rats? I ordered the large version and am really happy with it. The top panel was bent, but that had to do with shipping, not Amazon. Prevue has made outstanding bird cages for years and this one does not disappoint. Have a second person to make setting up the cage a breeze and be sure to assemble the panels IN ORDER so that everything lines up properly. Just check for burrs (rough metal along the metal bars I didn't have any) and check the screw holes for metal flakes that prevent the screw from going through (I had 1 like that). Other than that, I absolutely love it. There are plenty of doors (6 side doors total and 2 front doors) it comes with 3 wood perches (preferably for a cockatiel or something similar in size) and 4 water/food bowls. It's very easy to put together (have at least 2 People) it's bigger than I expected and I'm glad it was. Perfect cage. My canary is soooooo happy. That makes me happy. This cage exceeded my expectations. It's quite large and is definitely a much better quality than I thought it would be for the low price. It's very sturdy, and my sugar glider is having fun exploring it. I will likely add another sugar glider soon. This cage is a terrific budget item for several small birds or a medium sized parrot. We purchased it to house some budgies who were surrendered to our rescue without a proper cage. The cage is easy to clean and has multiple access points. There is also ample room for toy placement and enrichment items. It took about an hour for two people to assemble. We did manage to put the slide-out bottom tray in backward but it didn't bother us enough to disassemble it and start over! Great cage for the price! Fast shipping! Big roomy and well-made. The 3 perches are all the same size and for larger birds than my canary, so I\u2019ll get a few smaller perches and angle one or two across corners. Mine came with 2 white plastic divided feeders which hook onto the bars. Quite pleased- lots of room for many more canaries too! I bought this cage in late July 2012.  I really like the design and looks of the cage.  The doors are very convenient and are logically placed. This cage is the home of a pair of Gouldian finches.  A nest box fits perfectly at one of the uppermost side doors.  The only problem that I have with this cage is that with only 3 months of use, it is RUSTING in several places including some weld seams.  I am very disappointed.  Even those cheap \"knock-down\" cages don't rust until after years of use.  I would caution anyone considering this cage to include the rust potential in your decision.  I wouldn't buy it had I known. This cage is well made. It is easy to clean with a slide out tray/floor. My cage arrived with tabs broken on two of the four food/water bowls and Prevue Pet Products replaced them. The new bowls seem to be made from a different plastic. I really like having the cage on wheels to make cleaning up after my messy cockatiels less of a chore. The cage is very nice and roomy, 2 things need improvement: ", "This cage came in the mail and it was a lot larger than I expected. The assembly took some time, but it wasn't difficult. It's a very spacious cage and it's pretty good quality. The plastic bird feeder bins that come with the cage don't last long. The hooks where the bins hang onto the cage are also plastic and can break easily if not handled with care. That's not a big deal though because you can always purchase different bird feeders to put in your cage. The cage came in good condition although I did notice a spot where the cage was a little bent. I have 9 parakeets and they have more than enough room in this cage. If ever I were to need another cage I would not hesitate to buy this one again! A bit cumbersome to assemble.  Requires two people.  I think I confused this with another cage sold on Amazon that had metal shelves.  This just has the large full length perches, which aren't the best for small birds.  Bottom of cage sits lower than I thought.  But generally once assembled it works fairly well.  It's light and easy to move for cleaning, putting the birds outside, etc.  Reasonably large for small birds.  I have to cockatiels and a parakeet in mine and they seem comfortable. It was delivered today as expected.  It arrived in perfect condition.  All pieces were present including the windbell lock and screw which was already attached.  It is easy for two people to assemble.  The feeding trays are large, perfect for this large cage.  One tray was cracked but it comes with four so this is not a  problem.  I have three parakeets and now have room for several more.  This is an excellent birdcage and a great price for the size and quality.  I couldn't be more pleased. For the price, it's a good cage. The quality of the cage is poor but again, what can you expect for the price. The directions are not very clear because none of the pieces are labeled. You'll end up putting the cage together and then realizing a piece is backwards and having to take it apart to try again. The cage wires were warped and bent and I had to use pliers to bend everything to get it to fit. If you're looking for something cheap, this is the way to go. If you're looking for quality, I would go else where. I was a little leary about buying this after reading some of the reviews on the assembly and missing holes; but the price was too hard to resist.  I received it yesterday, and assembled it by myself with no difficulty. The instructions were clear enough; but it would have been easier if they had put labels on the parts. The bird cage is very sturdy and easy to assemble. I like the cage and love the rollers.  The plastic feeding cups are an unusual size and have to be special ordered as they broke during shipping. I'm not going to send back the entire cage for the feeding cups. My four parakeets are thrilled to death to be living in this cage.  It's wonderful!  It's the size of a parrot cage with the bar spacing of a keet cage.  Exactly what I wanted.  The one thing that I would change is that the food doors open sideways instead of up and down and it can be difficult to find baths and things that fit this style.  However, this is my favorite purchase of the year.  Great price, fantastic cage.... do beware the bedding tray, though.... it doesn't fit well and sometimes falls out, making a mess. Great company with great customer service so makes it an even better buy but really nice cafe we have it for four finches and even with all the perches they fly all around I love this cage, it is just the size i wanted. I had to look at the reviews beofr buying it and i love when people post pics of theirs. The o ly thing wrong with the cage is that the pieces where slightly bent but it wasnt much of an issue. Only a perfection freak would see a problem with that. Its easy to put together but alittle confusing too. My birds love it. I do like how the wheels are kinda gliddy. I also like the 8 doors that helps alot. 5 star if it wasnt bent/bowed a bit. Arrived packaged well with extra measures to assure no wires were bent.  Directions were scant but we managed to put it together in less than an hour.  Certianly easier with 2 people. Large cage is great for my middle sized African Red Bellied parrot.  Food dishes are a little flimsy so I will be replacing with stainless steel.  Spring loaded doors will require extra security for smart birds and I will fix this with thumb clips to prevent accidental escapes!\u00a0 ", "Awesome cage !! It was bought for my lovebird and she loves it !!! The only issue was that one of the food bowls was cracked. I wish I could exchange it but I am not sure if I can do that without returning the whole thing that is already together. It was a bit time consuming to put it together but very worth it !! Highly recommended. Great flying room for her ! We like the cage, and our birds are enjoying it. The Four plastic double cups came with the plastic pieces that hold them m in place a little loose so when you try putting them on the cage they break. I had to go and buy others at a store near by. The I love the flight cage, the problem is that the parts were so badly protected during shipping. I believe it would be the box the manufacturer packed the product in. There was virtually no protection around any of the pieces in the box. bars were bent, panels were bent and a food dish was broken.  Because the panels were bent it took forever to put the cage together because when you were trying to secure the panels they kept popping out of place. If you put the poor packaging to the side and look at the cage itself it's just an ok buy. The  birds love it, we have 21 finches and they are flying all over the place. The perches they provide are good. At first I thought they might be too large for the finches but they are using them very easily. A real negitve are the doors. It sounds great when you hear they will shut automatically because they use springs in the doors, the problem is if the springs fail the door isnt going to stay shut at all.  These doors are located on the two ends of the cage both in the lower and upper part of the cage. This is a big plus, you have easy access to the inside of the cage to  put food and water dishes in, the negitive is you can only reach in so far and then you have to use one on the two doors they have in front which are poorly designed. It uses the type of closer where you run a small bar down the side of the door that goes through little holes to keep the door shut, they leave very little left after the last hole and the bar at the top you have to turn and move the rounded bar through a hole. Im not discribing it very well but its not convieniant nor do I like how loose it is. This item is exactly as described.  We did match up the panels correctly, but there were some of the holes/wires off by the tiniest of space.  One wire had to be bent to fit into the hole, but we got it together.  Very sturdy cage and my birds love it.  The plastic feeder trays included are not very durable.  One of the tabs that attaches it to the wires has already broken off.  The large waste collection tray at the bottom is more flexible than expected.  You must support it well when you remove it or it will twist and dump the contents into the floor.  I love the wheels.  It is awesome to be able to easily move the cage around.  I definitely would recommend purchasing this cage.  At this price, a couple of small issues are excusable. I love this cage! Pretty easy to assemble. Very sturdy. I have 6 parakeets (budgies) & there's a lot of room for them now to fly around & play. I love that I can roll this on the carpet to vacuum where the birds have made a mess or just move them anywhere in the house. Very easy to just wipe clean. My only issue I have is when I received the item & I opened it & took everything out of the box to assemble it, 1 of the 4 plastic feeder/water contains had a piece broke off it where it clips to the cage. The clips fitted very tight & made it hard to take the water dish out to clean without spilling water all over so I cut the bars on the cage so it fits better. Other then that, it's perfect! Thank you!!! Easy to put together.  All parts where there and nothing was bent. This cage is the way to go for economy . It is roomy. The doors nice sized but the design of the drop pin is simplistic and a hassle especially if you have an escape artist. Tried using for a Quaker and she figured out how to get out regardless of how any clips I tried to use. I ended up giving it to the cockatiels instead. They size is generous but needs a little fine tuning for smaller puzzle loving birds. I would rate higher if the doors had a differnt latch system. I still think it's a good affordable cage for less inquisitive birds but know your bird before you decide if the door latches will work for you. My two parrotlets love it and they are so much happier in a roomy cage that I don't feel so guilty.  When they say it needs to two people to assemble - it does - unless you are three handed and ambidexterous.  It has a good placement of doors and feeders. I would have given this a 5 star, because the whole thing went together easily and is very good craftsmanship, however one of the plastic feeders came broken.  Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this. I'll change my review to a 5 star if they replace the item. This is a good size and my bird loves it.  I wish the big doors had latches on them.  The device there is kind of cheaply made and you need to make sure that the little metal pole goes into the loop to lock it shut (per se).  That is my only issue.  I like the size, it wasnt too bad to put together and the ease of cleaning is wonderful.  The bottom tray slides out but so does the grate.  Easy to wipe down.  Good cage overall. ", "Went together easily and yes I did it myself.  (it would be easier with 2 people).  Easy to clean and my sugar gliders love it.  Lots of door openings but I locked all down but front and I've had no escapes, except when I forget to close the door.  Rolls easily and takes up minimal space. I was nervous after reading so many negative reviews, but I had no problems! It came packaged nicely and all pieces in perfect condition. I had no issues putting it together with the help of another person and it's very sturdy! I decided to take the bottom sliding grate and modify it as middle floor by cutting off the handle and a section of bars, and then wiring it all securely. I used cooling racks that I already owned as levels, and then used the levels from their old cage as ramps. The appeal of this cage, besides the size, is that I can customize it many ways to suit my needs. Overall a great purchase and my 3 little ratties absolutely love their new home! I really like this cage. I know the dimensions were on it, and I thought I had an idea how big this was- but it was bigger than I expected. It is great. I have one budgie now, but he will be getting some friends soon and they should all have plenty of room, even with plenty of toys. I don't understand how anyone could have a difficult time putting this cage together. It does take two people, but it took us like 15 to 20 minutes to put together. The cage is very sturdy and my finches have a lot of room to fly! I'm extremely happy with my purchase!! I'll start by saying that I doubt you'll find a cage this size for such a great price. We've had this cage for almost 6 months and it has held up very well with the exception of the food/water cups. Two of them were broken when the cage arrived and one broke a couple of months later. The cage houses our 3 parakeets with plenty of space and is easy to clean. We have had no problems with the bottom tray sliding out easily and it stays in place without a problem. It was $25.00 less when I purchased it, which made it a better value. I would definitely recommend this cage if you need more space for your birds, but cannot afford to break the budget to do so. After reading reviews I was worried about assembly- but actually it was easy! Took about thirty minutes. Pieces all in good condition. Great size cage for my parakeets. This cage is affordable and huge.  We got a baby 8 week old parakeet  and put him in this cage. It took a few weeks to get used to the size. He came from a really small shared cage.  He is one happy bird now. He has room to fly around and I have room to put multiple big bird toys in the cage. Even with all the toys, perches, and food dishes he has room to fly around. The family dog has jumped on the cage daily and it still holds up.  The cage has wheels and is easily rolled around to move from room to room or just roll to clean the floor. It is easy to clean.  Everyone who sees the bird and its home comment on how he is one spoiled bird. Isn't that how it should be. It is hard to assemble. It is not that you can't figure how to do it, but that it is badly manufactured and some of the pieces simply won't fit into each other, I gave up and wanted to send it back, but my buddy was able to fit them with some extra force. Bird approved it though, from when we were struggling to assemble it, and went inside as soon as it was finished, on his own, and made lots of happy noises. Bar spacing is too small, should be good for much smaller birds than ours, we have a maroon-bellied conure. Really like this cage for my parakeet. He looks so small in it, but love that he has so much room. This would probably  be good if you have a larger bird like a cockatiel also. Had a few burrs on some bars but filed down with a fingernail file and touched up with non toxic acrylic paint. Otherwise, wonderful product so far. ", "Okay I admit when we first purchased this flight cage, I didn't think it was quite as big as it was. e found this one priced lower than some cages that were smaller and decided this was the best for our buck! I am really happy with the price. The food dishes are junk. Two have broken in the first week. Overall build is a little cheesy but I expected that for the price. It is big and my budgie and cockatiel have plenty of room. The lack of horizontal bars keeps my little retards from climbing and encourages flight but makes it hard to make a toy end up in just the right spot. I bought clips to keep the spring loaded doors shut because they open by pressure from the inside instead of out... which to me is stupid. If a bird hits it hard enough, it will open. This cage is awesome! I own two parakeets and they both love it! I've had it for maybe a month and a half now and it's still in super good condition. Very sturdy and easy to clean. The set up wasn't too bad. Some of the screws weren't going in, but after I figured that out, it turned out great. I'm very happy with this product. We got this for my daughters Sun Conure! It is an excellent cage. Well built. It is very sturdy and her bird has plenty of space! This is a huge bird cage! I love these flight cages  as my African Gray loves to get into everything. Putting it together takes patience and zip-ties. I am short so that made it tough. Overall great cae. I have bought three of these cages over the years and while they get the job done, the quality is simply poor. The cages usually come bent with holes that don't align and crooked threads for the screws. Putting it together is a hassle and once you do it's very hard to disassemble and put back in the box so returning it is very difficult. That said, it gets the job done and has a huge flight area. I would recommend this for small birds like finches so they can fly around inside. Also the cage is kind of an eyesore with it's dark color and ugly wire. For the price though it's probably the best value on the market. Pretty easy to assemble, would have been easier if the parts would have been labeled like the picture in the directions...other than that its huge, i have 6 birds in it and theres plenty of room for more...not a super sturdy cage but not flimsy either... We keep pet rats and the kid was always building castles for them that don't fit in the cage.  Now we have a huge cage that he can build the castles inside and the cats can't bother the critters.  It's very sturdy and nice quality. Easy enough to put together and instructions are clear. Using ours for our sugar gliders and it provides a lot of adjustable room for cage sets. The doors on the side are my only complaint as they are able to be opened through a push/spring door. I ended up zip-tying mine just to be safe. Otherwise this cage is great! Love the storage underneath. I bought this based on the positive reviews.  My one concern was that people repeatedly commented on the lack of assembly directions and that two people were needed for the assembly.  I'm happy to say that while I found the directions less informative than I would have liked they did do the trick.  Also, I put it together all by myself in about an hour.  Two people would certainly make the job easier but it is far from impossible.  It's a great cage and I'm very happy with my purchase. ", "If you're looking for a cheap cage and don't care about things being bent and broken, then this cage is for you! A lot of pieces were bent, some of the pieces didn't have holes in them so you could connect them, and even pieces of the doors broke off. This cage is so fragile I'm afraid to move it downstairs. Would not buy again. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting this cage to be such good quality for such a great price. I got this for my lovebird because he needs lots of room to play and enjoy himself. He is so happy in his cage and he has plenty of room. The only thing is I have had to put zip ties on the side doors because my lovebird is mad strong and can push through the doors. Other than that it\u2019s def worth the price! This cage is perfect for my two cockatiels. Definite takes two people to assemble and about a half hour. When assembling it\u2019s best to leave all screws loose and then tighten once it\u2019s all together. I LOVE this cage. The only downfall being the doors are a little small. So easy to assemble. My 10 year old and I did it without any issues. Plenty of room for my sugar gliders and we have not had an escape yet, (had this cage about 6 months now) Took me 2 days to put it together by myself. Get some help lol. I love the height and sturdiness. Birds are happy. Used for 3 cockatiels. Have to bend over to clean tray though. had i seen this in a store i would have paid double the price. I can't BELIEVE how much value you get. I am really happy i spent a lot of time researching for the best product and boy I found it! Be patient putting together. It took me about an hour and half to get this together especially toward the end when you have to line up the holes and spokes and screw it together at the same time. but it is worth it. VERY PLEASED! I am raising organic-fed quail and this gives them space to fly around when they want to. Easily roll it outside during summer. perfect!! I wish I had realized that the side doors don't stay open - they're spring loaded to stay shut. I have one cockatiel that was not hand trained and will not step up on my hand on command. With the last cage, I was able to \"guide\" her into an open side door with my hand. It's a little trickier trying to use one hand to hold said door open while using the other hand to usher my baby inside. This product came bent, yet the box was not damaged in any way. It absolutely took two people to assemble it. The majority of the metal is extremely flimsy. I purchased this flight cage for my 2 Gouldian Finches a little over 2 months ago. My babies love the huge space they now have! It is very easy to clean. Nothing fancy but for the price-you cant go wrong. It is very sturdy and has wheels so it would be easy to move if needed. The only negative thing I have found is the large feeder containers..they do not fit well between the bars and two have broke because of the bad fit. I am still using the 1 (double compartments)and am looking for a couple other single dishes to offer vegetables in. I am so glad I purchased this cage-Most likely the only cage Oliver and Olivia will ever need :-) No trouble assembling this cage at all. The bird loves his new condo! ", "This cage is a great value!  Assembly instructions could be better.  I assembled it single-handed so it can be done.  The color could better be described as textured dark bronze paint on regular cage wire.  I have finches and this is just great for them to have a lot of flying room.  They really use the entire cage.  There is room for a natural tree branch for them to perch.  I used the small perches from an old cage across the corners.  A clip-on bird bath I had fit in the small doors.  Having multiple doors is really helpful for cleaning and arranging things in the cage.  Your birds will LOVE this cage!!! This is a really good cage for the money. I\u2019ve gone from 8 to 18 parakeets. Breeding like crazy. Needed a bigger cage and this one is perfect! Awesome cage!  After moving our finches, they all hung out around the top section, but within an hour or so they were flying all around the cage.  They seem to chirp a lot more, and can DEFINITELY fly more as their old cage was much too small.  Changing water and food is much easier, and the large dishes are a nice bonus.  In fact, I have even seen our finches bathing in the water dish! This cage is very flimsy and not sturdy at all, especially the doors. Also, the spacing around the rim is more than 1/2 inch. As some others have done, I purchased this for a pair of sugar gliders and they escaped the first night because the opening was larger than it was supposed to be. We had to zip tie plastic chain around all the larger areas so they couldn't get out again while we ordered a better cage...and what a difference! Love this cage, fits my 3 cockatiels perfectly with plenty of room to spare. Took about an hour to assemble, but everything went together without an issue. Only thing I can say I don't necessarily like is that the doors on the side are only on a spring (pull towards you from the outside) with no locking mechanism option. Had to get separate clips to prevent any accidents as they are not all that difficult to open. Other than that, i'm very happy with this cage!! large cage, medium quality metal though. It's a bit difficult to clean and the hanging food cups it comes with can melt in the dishwasher, but for the price it was well worth it. The few cons I have are that the wires can be a little flimsy, and in order to put the cage together you need to bend a few of them. Larger doors would also be very helpful as its a little difficult to get large sticks and perchs in and out. The side doors are also held shut by only a small spring, no latch. A smart bird, or whatever else in the cage, would only have to figure out that he can push the door open and escape. Great home for parakeets. We have two of them. Perfect size for maybe four or five parakeets. Enough room to fly and be happy. Food dishes are great, fill them up and don't have to worry about refilling for almost two weeks. I do check every other day though as the water dishes evaporate. Super easy to clean. Super easy to set up, didn't even need the directions. Quality is also good. I would say the locks need a spring to assure the birds can't lift them up. Came home one day and the birds weren't in the cage. Smart buggers. My parakeets absolutely love this cage. The fact that they can exercise their wings by flying around in the cage makes me so happy. They are much happier birds too We purchased this, and after a few months, the place where the screws go into the panels popped out completely, leaving the cage useless. I made several attempts to contact Prevue's customer service through their phone number, never having my call answered, so I e-mailed them, and was told they would provide a replacement part, but I would have to pay for shipping, and they couldn't tell me what that would be until it actually shipped. Sturdy enough for my plumhead parakeet & a couple more med size birds would still have flight space. It\u2019s bendable a tad bit also,so it\u2019s exactly what I expected. Easy to clean. Love the 4food trays it comes with too. ", "I bought this for my parakeet. She seems very happy with it, lots of room, no problem climbing around on the vertical bars after being used to having horizontal bars in her old cage. The height is, like others have mentioned, possibly more than you need. Birds with clipped wings who take a tumble when they try to fly will fall quite fall in this cage, keep that in mind. Lots of doors make it convenient to place dishes, toys, etc into cage.You will need additional perches - this comes with three dowels but they are quite large and birds benefit from having a variety of perch sizes to choose between. I had bought this cage model second hand for my budgies and loved it; so finding a new one at this price was an awesome deal since the person who sold it to me paid 250 for the first cage, new. Unfortunate for me, the cafe came in looking like it had been banged around previous to having been boxed. Several bits were bent making it necessary to be bent back into shape durring assembly. We have two small parrolettes and they are in heaven. Although the cage is pretty large, I feel like they advanced from a small apartment to a mansion as my son called it. This cage is pretty great for my cockatiel, very sturdy, nice, and she has lots of room to fly and explore. Assembly wasn't hard, but some of the wires were bent out of shape, especially around the links of the sides of the cage and the small side doors. The plastic trays for food and water are very cheaply made and don't fit in the cage barely at all... not what I expected. Still, good cage for the price and I think it will last us a long time. I\u2019m sure my 5 little zebra finches feel like they died and went to heaven in this HUGE enclosure. I love it! All of the doors make it easy to arrange and clean. The assembly was so much easier than I expected after reading all of the reviews. I did most of it myself but had a little help with the last few steps. It took about 30-45 minutes. The directions were just fine. Great cage for sugar gliders A few of my pieces did not fit as nicely as I liked and some of them had rust :(.... although, I just have cockatiels and they aren't that strong...A little disappointing but, the overall structure is sturdy.. Its enough space for more than 3 of them. Well to be perfectly honest, the instructions suck! It took me HOURS to put it together because I had to guess, than has to disassemble part and redo it due to the poor instructions. Also the spring doors have very sharp edges and I'm terrified my birds will injure themselves on it, I will be attempting to take them off if I can. Perfect for our Cockatiel. He has a lot more room to play and spread his wings! There is plenty of room for multiple birds of you have them. Easy to assemble. Recommend wire ties, pipe cleaners or similar to hold edges together during assembly stages if doing the assembly alone. Bought for a flying squirrel and he can grasp the wire easily as well as run along the perch dowels. Plenty of room for added branches hollow logs and nesting bags. ", "I have 2 cockatiels and 1 parakeet that I always let free fly in my sunroom which left it quite a mess with chewing, and their feathers and whatnot all over. I had a quite nice parrot cage with a play top which they did not have enough room to live in. For those who have problems with assembling the cage, here are the steps. Refer to the first page of the instruction manual to see what pieces I am referring to in my instructions. Easy to assemble, though the instructions could use better illustrations. I was in a rush and assembled a few parts backwards and had to redo it. It only took about 20 minutes. Wanted a large cage for our parakeets I absolutely loved this case for my two parakeets. Ever since I have had this cage, (which has been a few months now) I can say the birds are so much happier. They have more than enough room to fly in there. They love it. The price was not bad at all for the size of the cage. It is huge! They used to be in the standard size cage I had bought them at Petco, so this change is amazing to them. The cage is so big that my husband wanted to buy two more parakeets. Overall we are very satisfied with the product and all the extra playing and chirping that came as a result from it. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase it. The only thing is to make sure you have help building it. I almost wanted to send it back for that reason, but it was worth the time and effort in the end. Very nice size cage for my Greencheek he loves it, easy to set up. I only had one issue, which I easily fixed where a single small bar popped off the side of the cage. This is a great size cage! For the price you can't go wrong. It was very easy to put together with two people about 40 minutes. It is a little on the flimsy side so no good for larger birds. I have a green cheek conure and this cage could easily house more. Inside cage size is 30 1/4\" x 20 1/4 \"x 40\" . The cage was packed nicely and secure. Some say the instructions or horrible but mine were very clear and we had no problem at all putting it together. Highly recommend this cage! Works great!  Sturdy and easy to assemble but hard enough to assemble that when my son put the back on the front he decided to leave it so he wouldn\u2019t have to take it all apart. Would have been super easy to put together fast IF any of the pieces would have had their labels! So it took us a little longer to put together but we love it! So do our 10 zebra finches.  If the pieces were labeled I would have given 5 stars. Great cage. A little challenging to get together but once I did it\u2019s sturdy and good quality. Very spacious the birds love it! ", "Great flight cage for the price.  Installation is fairly simple and all of the pieces and bolts fit perfectly.  I don't like the rollers on the bottom, so I replaced them with stationary chrome/plastic feet.  I placed the cage on top of an appropriately sized coffee table.  This elevates the cage so the finches feel more comfortable flying to the bottom.  Also, I chose the color black because my existing white cage seems to reflect too much light and it's harder to see the birds. I was so excited to get this cage!! My 9 year old daughter and I put this cage together on our own so it\u2019s simple to do! It was packaged well and came promptly. I would say it took about an hour to put together. My budgies LOVE this cage. Only problem is now I have to order bigger toys. \ud83d\ude02 I highly recommend this product. I LOVE this cage & so do my finches!  I put it together myself, although it did say 2 people should put it together.  The instructions were clear as well as the pictures. The smaller doors on both sides of the cage make for easy access to almost all parts of the cages and being as they are small and spring loaded I just put my arm in and don't worry so much about someone escaping.  That all being said this cage would be perfect for most any bird but I imagine a really large bird could bend the bars.  I only have 2 issues:  The first being the tray on the bottom was a little loose fitting and kept trying to fall out I got it in but if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate.  The second is the thickness of the perches.  These perches are for a MUCH larger bird I did use a couple but I also have my own smaller ones that attach to the cage I plan on addressing this with the manufacturer. I loved this cage... I have 4 budgies and wanted to put them all in one large cage bc the once they were in were too small and they dint have that much flight room. The cage is great. Dowels warped but usable, and just one of the trays arrived with a tab broken off so it can't be used. It's a real pain to assemble by yourself.  Also, the spring-loaded doors open outward, so a smart bird could learn to simply push on a door and escape. Purchased this for my four cockatiels.  Perfect cage.. once you get it together. The directions require a magnifying glass and even then, you're left wondering which piece goes where as none are marked and some are very similar.  Once I got it together, which required two people, I realized I had a couple in the wrong place.. but after the hours it took to get it together there was no way I was taking it apart.  BUT even with the mistakes, it works and it sturdy and the birds don't seem to mind that the bottom should actuallly be on top..lol This was a birthday gift for my son he was extremely dissappointed when this arrived with a cracked tray and bent and broken cage sides. The company had to send me replacement panels but were wonderful about being prompt and forgiving of the damaged parts. I own a cage like this and like it but this one was defective. I was not happy. ", "My flying squirrel absolutely loves this cage. There\u2019s some really weird doors on it that have to be (in my opinion) Zip tied shut because they\u2019re easily pushed open but other than that it\u2019s a great cage My parakeets LOVE this new cage. It took my husband about 2 hours to put it together. My birds are so much happier in this cage and it has all sorts of door and latches that make it very easy to access the birds and water, food etc. Would recommend to everyone. The cage came with all the prices and all the screws and my cockatiels love it and I do too however, the doors however are quite small and difficult to reach in the cage everywhere and the cage isn\u2019t very sturdy. Also the directions to assemble it weren\u2019t very clear and it was difficult. I did already write a review for this - because I am so pleased with this birdcage.  My birds are so happy!!!! I bought this cage at a local store for $200 (should have checked Amazon...) and it's awesome. I have a single (spoiled) cockatiel in it and she has sooo much room to move around. It's wonderful. There are small doors on the sides with no locking mechanism, but I just ziptied them closed. Problem solved. Tray on the bottom is easy to remove and clean. Perches are a nice size. Four food bowls are included. I do wish they made a better cage cover for this (the one they do make is too thin to be of any use), but I will just make my own. Great cage but was going to buy 2 more but prices went way higher. So going to wait till process go back down again. Got this for my budgie, he loves all the space he gets! Would recommend for up to 3 small birds or 1-2 medium birds. Very sturdy, came in perfect condition, and easy to clean. (Unfortunately my budgie doesn\u2019t like it when the floor moves! Poor baby) Great in so many ways, but their is a flaw.  Where the legs meet the bottom of the cage, all four corners of my cage pulled away.  This led to the grate and tray beneath to fall down.  This means any animal in cage could escape.  Fortunately none of my birds got out as this happened while I was moving the cage.  I have used wire to hold it together for now, may need to get some zip ties. I love this cage. Was easy to put together even though the instructions used very few words, the illustrations showed exactly how it was supposed to go together and while I did have to fight with a few pieces and as for help from my girlfriend, from start to finish was about 20 minutes. My 2 birds LOVE the space! It did have 1 loose bar at the top, but nothing a little silver solder didn't fix. Great large cage for my 5 parakeets. Putting it together by yourself is hard because you have to line everything up without the other side falling out, so have someone help. I like the bottom grate can come out for cleaning along with the tray. ", "I don't know what to say. Such a short distance from being satisfied with the product and total mess. They didn't even look at what are they packing. Great large cage. Was packaged very well, no bent bars or anything. Also, the instructions were pretty straight forward, took me about 30 minutes to put the whole thing together, without any help! I had limited space for this cage, otherwise I would have gotten the xl. Worth the 117 I paid for it. We've been really happy with this cage.  4 parakeets live happily with plenty of space.  The poo tray is a little annoying as it sometimes slips tracks - but there are bars above the tray, so no escape concern while you clean. The doors (many ) shut well, seems sturdy.  It comes with feeders that are just fine, but we ended up getting new ones because they are a little tight, and I kept spilling the water changing it.  Also, they're uncovered, so they get seed all over and poo in their water.  Pretty minor issue though. This cage is amazing! I only wish I would have bought it sooner. My finches recently had babies and everyone needed a bigger home. This cage provides them so much more room to fly and hop about. It also has four food and water compartments. It was fairly simple to put together and is very sturdy. A great buy for the price. You will not be sorry you bought this! Your birdies won\u2019t either. Bummed bars were bent and the tray came broken, still in the box a year after purchasing and now I'm on here searching for a tray that will fit... One of the grille prices was welded backwards and was not able to assembled the cage correctly. Also, a hex screw, which is used in assemble and are not given any extras, was stripped. I will say the package was emaculant. The directions are simple. My complaint is of the manufacturing issue. Wonderful, my birds, 5 cockatiels, are so happy.  Lots of room for them, perches, toys, food, everything.  You HAVE to have help holding it during assembly, but not hard to do.  The wheels allow for easy moving, I roll it out on my patio during sunny days and bath time.  The tray removes and cleans easily in the tub.  Hang the feed trays low and the most of the seeds stay in the cage.  Best purchase ever for my birds! Don't be fooled by the Amazon's Choice label. That is based on reviews which are mostly fake per Fakespot. The bars and flimsy and the quality control is abysmal. The cage I received cannot be constructed as the holes are pre-drilled on the WRONG SIDE of one of the panels. This is in addition to the damaged panel I received. Going through the reviews, this an common issues. STEER CLEAR of this poor product! I bought it for my parakeets, arrived very secure in the box, and no damages at all. Love this cage, it was easy to assemble just took me 30 minutes to do it, I might buy different wheels cuz these ones do not have brakes but it's not a big deal. Day 1 with this new cage and so far so good! Got this for my two male cockatiels who both love to explore and play, and therefore need a lot of space. They normally hate being confined but have appeared to take well to this larger enclosure. It was fairly easy to put together as well, I did it by myself in about an hour. Great cage for the price! ", "I now have 11 parakeets after one of my females had 6 babies.  They are all very much enjoying themselves and have plenty of room to hop, climb and fly.  I am so happy I got this cage, it's not as flimsy as some cages.  Very sturdy and great quality.  I highly recommend this product. Just finished putting this item together last night. It is a great cage for the price. Nice and big and plenty of accessories. The assembly was easy enough, save for a few human errors (no ones perfect!) but we are looking forward to housing our brand new Cockatiels in this cage. They'll have plenty of space to stretch their wings for sure. I don\u2019t know what these people are talking about their cage all bent... the packaging is amazing there\u2019s no way for bent pieces... easy to put together.... awesome cage!!!! I\u2019m happy I bought it!!!! Almost didn\u2019t too reading reviews.... honestly you ain\u2019t loosing with this cage and for price you can\u2019t go wrong!!!! Promise it\u2019s legit!!!! We have two quaker parrots  We just got them an wanted new cages. I read a lot about cages and the reviews on these was pretty good. These had some instructions but my husband put on together today with a little help from me. They are good sturdy cages an bigger than they sound. If you have to put it together by your self you could use some light wire to hold it untill you tighten the screw. As the one person said there were two holes on top corner he had to drill out. No big deal Thet have four double seedor food holders and four perches'see no reason to not give them five stars The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 Stars is the fact that the cage did not come with labeled parts.  Yes there are instructions but be prepared to do some guessing.  Assemble with two people, doing this solo is a pain.  Other than that this cage is amazing for the price!  My Cockatiel does great in this! Great cage for the price. Assembly was easy. We keep our Quaker parrot in it. He has lots of room for his toys. Great cage, especially for the price. One bar snapped out of it in the first week we've had it -- ended up just putting one of the bowls over the hole. Can't argue with a cage this nice for that price. Some assembly required. It took me over an hour to unpack the cage and another two hours to put it together. It\u2019s well worth the cost. It is strong and well made. But, Some assembly required. Absolutely love this cage! It did take me several hours to put it together but my only assistants were a chair, the wall, the floor, and some zip ties! Considering I\u2019m close to 70 I thought I did really well. Quality is great and my five parakeets love it. I put this together myself with no help or tools.  It took me several hours because I went slow.  My two parakeets LOVE this.  It\u2019s their home and not a cage.  Looks nice.  Rollers make it easy to move.  Easy to clean. ", "I was pretty excited to put together this cage for my extremely pampered Love Birds. It's a beautiful cage, the casters glide wonderfully (Even over the seeds they throw on the ground), and the spacing is perfect so they can't escape (no zip ties necessary for this cage!) I have two cockatiels - one with disabled feet. I wanted a large area for him to walk so ended up with a much taller cage to get that overall room. I have added multiple ladders and perches to this cage to help him navigate. The doors are great - there are 6 - 2 each on the front and sides - making it easy to adjust toys and perches. Our birds really love their new digs. It is easy to move them from room to room and there is a nice large shelf underneath to store their gear. I got this cage for my Sun Conure to use during the day on a screened in porch like an aviary. It was easy to put together, secure, large, and allows for plenty of active movement and toys. It was an excellent price for this size cage. It is simply designed and very functional. Absolutely worth it! I LOVE this cage.  Its plenty big for my cockatiel.  What I was looking for in a cage is one that my baby can fly around in and at least spread her wings a bit, and this allows that.  It not big enough that she can /really/ fly wildly around in it, but that would take an actual avery i think, lol. I got this cage for my sugar gliders. It is a great size, and it was pretty easy to put together, but you will probably need 2 people to hold things together while you assemble it. The only complaint I have is that you have to find a way to secure the 6 side doors because they do not have a latch. Overall, I think this is a great cage for the price. This cage sells for $250 at my local pet store. Super easy to assemble. Took me 15 minutes alone. Large and sturdy. Tray and bottom cage shelf slide out easily for cleaning. I use the saran that sticks in the tray for super easy clean up. Plenty of space to house conures or smaller birds. We have 2 conures in ours and they love to climb all over it. Do have to add clips to the side doors as they are spring loaded only. My keets love this cage!  I have 2 of this cage now.  Lots of places for toys, dishes and them to just enjoy themselves.  Only thing I don't like are the open dishes because they started laying eggs in them. Just changed them over to smaller covered dishes.  If they wouldn't lay eggs in them, the dishes would have been perfect. Used as home for 4 young yappy parakeets. Nice cage for the $$. Don't be fooled difficult to assemble. Directions are vague. Parts not numbered to go with directions. Be prepared to buy different perches. These are to large for Lovebirds, Cockatiels. To assemble I put base together first as per instruction, then put base on it's back and assembled the back while laying on the floor, I also added the screws to help hold but didn't screw tight. I purchased this for my two Zebra Finches named Scratch and Sniff ", "I bought this for my 2 sugar gliders and it is perfect. I assembled it very easily with the help of my 10 year old son in less than an hour. It is easy to clean, easy to roll and the bar spacing is true to size (my babies are unable to escape!). This is a fantastic cage and a great price So I basically have a flock of budgies and I had to buy a second one of these and connect it to the first one I owned. They love the space even though I let them out. I spare no cost for my feathered babies and for the quality I am 100% you would not be able to get a similar item for under $200 This bird cage is perfect for my 3 conures. A little flimsy, but to be expected with the low cost of product. I wanted something that would fit through the door, but also be big enough to give my birds their space, this cage was on target. In photo it does look a bit like a double cage but, it\u2019s not. I purchased the cage for sugar gliders. The directions were simple, I had to match parts based on pictures which was not a big deal. I assembled alone with no help in about an hour. The cage is not black. It's a dark pewter but still blends in fine. Great for the price! This cage has very bad welds had to use tie straps. The doors are very badly made. It's  low quality, but it's a good size cage. I bought this cage on June 24 2016. Update... Today is September 20 2019 this cage has rusted right through in so many areas especially in the legs it's so bad that I need to buy another cage to replace this one before the birds get out. My wife and I have sugar gliders and were in desperate need of a bigger cage.  We looked at several different bird cages and even a big cage for ferrets.  We could not find a decently priced cage anywhere that would have small enough gaps in the sides to keep the gliders from escaping as well as enough room for them to move around.  My wife did some research and found this cage.  I took 2 looks at it and said that this was the one. It was exactly what we needed. It is made out of a durable material and now we aren't so much worried about them chewing the paint off the cage like they did with previous bird cages.  They absolutely love it and play a lot more.  We can tell that they are happier.  I have to say that even though this cage is larger, it is very easy to clean.  We just wheel it out side and spray it off with the hose. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone. It was very easy to put it together, it is super large and that is the long one.  I also love definitely safe and reasonable price, I am very satisfied. \u2764\u2764 Bars are really flimsy and come apart from seams very easily.. I\u2019m caging parakeets so they\u2019re not strong enough to chew bars..would never use it for a bird any larger than a parakeet Let me start out by saying I put this cage together by myself and it only took about 30 min if that. The bars are pretty flimsy and the side doors had to be zip tied shut because they push open way to easy but other than that its perfect. Great cage for my finches, they seem to love it. I upgraded from a cage half the size of this one. ", "Gorgeous huge cage for a wonderful price, but a few broken bars, looks like due to bad packaging. GOOD PRODUCT FOR A REALLY GOOD PRICE.  ORPHANED COCKATIEL WE FOUND SEEMED TO LIKE AND NOW HE IS STILL LIVING IT AT A NEW HOME. None Bought this for my two zebra finches. The instructions were pretty terrible but luckily I have a smart boyfriend who figured it out. It's pretty solid! It's honestly very nice! My only suggestion is that this company work on making better instructions.... Everything about this this is perfect. So easy to construct, perfect for parakeets because they fly horizontally, easy to build, and just wow. The doors are very secure. The pullout tray works great. The whole design is fantastic. Perfect for finches, parakeets and button quail. Easy to put together and once birds are removed it can be power washed! Great cage! Very happy! We have 3 parakeets and this cage gives them a lot of space to climb, fly, play with each other and their toys. This cage is spectacular I use it for a small parrotlet but it would work for a much larger bird he has all kinds of room. I did have to secure the doors on the sides as I was afraid of him getting out or other animals getting in SO, this is the 4th time ive gotton this cage, the first was for parakeets and the rest have been for cockatiels. Im still putting this last one together. so far its been a half hour and im not even close. the pieces are getting worse made every time. the last time the top was bent but other then that everything went in fine. THIS TIME. i cant even get the bottom back pannel to screw in on one side because they arent fitting right together. im supposed to get my new baby tiel soon and this cage has to be done.  it is a great cage once its done, and IS supposed to be done with 2 people but ive done it everytime except one by myself. THIS itme is just horrable. Normally id reviw this cage and say its awesome except the pieces can be bent. right now its such a dificulty because of this piece wont fit in right. My cage arrived yesterday and despite the directions saying you need two people, it only took me about 30 minutes to assemble alone. Some of the bars were bent, but a pair of pliers was all it took to easily repair them. Overall, my bird loves her new cage. ", "Cage arrived with no damaged parts. While the assembly instructions and some reviews suggest having two people do the assembly, I don't see where that is necessary or even useful. One person can easily assemble the cage. The instructions are clear enough and emphasize the one important point, the spring doors open out. I like the cage, now I have to wait and see what the birds think of it. I have 2 parakeets in it and they fly all over. Very easy to keep clean with slide trays Took 2 people to assemble. You could probably do it by your self if you're more focused than me. Great size for price. My parakeet loves it. I definitely like this flight cage! Great value for the price we paid! We upgraded from a cage half the size and our birds are really happy. This came really fast. We were a little worried it would be flimsy because of the price, but it's sturdy as heck. No bends...all the pieces were there. The color matches our ferret cage exactly which was a plus. It's like a pitted metal dark silver color. I didn't have issues with the tray falling out. The instructions were clear, but the pictures were a bit small for me of the pieces. I wish there had been a picture of it all set up to help a little, but in all, it didn't take much time at all. My boyfriend helped, but it could definitely be done with one person. The screws have the tool included. My only complaint is that 2 of the 4 white food trays had broken hooks, so they are unusable. It came with 4 large food/water trays with perches, and 3 long wood perches also. Our parakeet is in heaven. Considering getting her a mate now. We had let her free roam, but the daily cleanup and her becoming tempermental was becoming an issue, so we thought we'd try this. The small starter cages are wayyyyy too small for birds IMHO. Just not humane. This cage is huge. Don't worry at all about size for a small size bird. They will love it. Yes there's plenty of flight room, which is what I was worried about. I was a little nervous about putting this together based on some of the reviews. Thankfully, the 4+ stars were right. We (and ours birds) love this enclosure! I liked the way the cage looked. It was nice and big. I would've rated it higher but it came with a defect. On one of the legs, the hole to screw in the bottom screen was I the wrong side, so I was only able to screw in 3 out of the 4 legs. I'm not going to bother going through customer service so I don't know how helpful they'd be in a similar situation. I assume they'd be helpful because I think Prevue is a good company, but I need the cage today and my husband is handy so he's just going to fix it. The cage was easy to assemble. It took me only 20 minutes to put it together. For the size this was definitely a good purchase. The wires are a little flimsy and a few bars on the top were bent out of shape, but they are close enough together that my parakeets cannot escape. Received cage with defective miss tapped hex screws and the bottom shelf (part C1) which had a corner that was not welded.I received a pack of replacement screws and no shelf.The person I have dealt with is  Jenifer K. who required me to email her my entire invoice of the order which I find as unusual just to get defective parts replaced.  I have contacted customer service 3 times in nearly a month. This cage is really heavy and with the bottom shelf not welded correctly (one corner not welded at all) the whole cage is unstable, This is not good.. The size of the cage is nice, and it is fairly easy to put together, but the slide at the bottom that holds the tray and grille was welded on upside down! As a result of this, the tray fits in the top part and the grille under it (which is utterly useless). Also, out of the four plastic feeding trays, two were broken. I've been looking around for a number to call to ask for replacement parts, but so far, no luck. ", "I was able to assemble this cage mostly alone. It seems to be very sturdy and the size Large I ordered gives my parrotlets lots of extra room. i had been looking at this cage for awhile at my local pet store but finally ordered from amazon- it was nearly 1/2 the price for the EXACT same cage! :)  assembly was easy but would be easier with two people- i just used twist ties to hold it together while i tightened the screws.  My parakeets LOVE it and with the casters it can easily roll onto my deck.  Great product and highly recommend!! The quality of the product is pretty lacking. Multiple piece were bent and needed a decent amount of persuasion to make fit. The whole cage does not look bad. This cage is great. Easy to put together, gives my parakeets plenty of flight room, and moves easily when I need to move it. I love the number of access panels/doors on it. There are two large ones on the front and then there are 4 on each side. Makes getting to things so much easier and I love that my  birds still have plenty of room to move around and stretch their wings even with their toys. I had a little trouble with assembly because it didn't have instructions in the box but this is a BIG cage, its sturdy and an EXCELLENT value. Don't hesitate if you need a roomy cage. I have 7 society finches, a Lady Gouldian, and a button quail in it and they are all happy. I just love this cage, my finches love it. They have plenty of flight space now. It was fairly easy to assemble, doing so myself. Great purchase for our favorite 4oz sugar glider Dobby! Dobby really LOVES his giant new cage he gets to rattle around in at 4AM while squeaking in utter delight. I do wish however it had come with shelves but since it's a parrot cage I assumed it wouldn't. The instructions were a pain, because nothing is numbered. Had to adjust the doors differently so my glider doesn't get out. Seems a little flimsy, but in another way solid. My sugar glider seems to love it a lot better than her other cage, as she has a ton of room to glide now. Overall I'm happy with it. Specially for the price! sturdy construction, lots of room for the parakeets to fly around in, came with wheels! Five Stars for sure.  Excellent material, Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Has wheels so that you can simply move cage around.  Tray for droppings slides out easily to clean.  Our Budgie loves this cage!  She can fly around from branch to branch, swing and get to food dishes with ease. Our budgie tweeted and chirped with delight in her new cage as soon as she got in there! If you have large birds ( 6 inches or larger ) it is roomy for maybe a couple or three max.  Thanks Prevue! ", "I have a small parakeet and the bars are fine for her, they aren't wide enough for her to slip through. The wood perches seem kind of wide for her feet but she doesn't really seem to mind. I think she likes all of the room she has in there compared to her old cage I do love the cage as it has TWO perches and many doors on the front and sides. It works great as an small indoor aviary for my finches and canary. However, the seed cups even when sanded down do not fit properly. I use a Tidy Seed or the Corral Seed cup and screw on cups for the water as well as water bottles. Otherwise, it looks great in my living room in front of the window. I like that it is not too tall and low to the ground for a great appearance. I plan to purchase more of these. Excellent cage for the money. They must have seen reviews about assembly issues because mine came with instructions. The cage is a great size for my finches.  After a few months, the plastic tray that sits on the bottom of the cage and collects the waste, doesn\u2019t stay on the cage - it falls off. Flimsy plastic tray. A lot of people don't realize that finches need a lot of space to fly! It keeps them happy and healthy. And for a finch to achieve full flight they need at least 20 inches of space but preferably more. And, flying up requires more energy than just flying side to side. With those things in mind, I realized I would be shortening the life of my new finches by keeping them in a pretty little cage! So, I shopped around and found this beauty. It has wheels, but I chose not to put them on. Instead, I put it on a small table because finches like to fly up for security. I didn't use the massive wooden perches that came with it, because they take up too much space. Instead I bought a few different styled, finch-sized perches and put them in. It says it can fit 6 finches, but I am an animal lover and I veer more toward giving my 2 birds space to do what they are made for: flying!! I have 4 parakeets in this cage and they LOVE it. They're very active and get plenty of exercise flying from perch to perch. The price was reasonable, it arrived in good condition, and it was not hard to put together. Instructions aren\u2019t very clear on which panel goes where for assembly but it\u2019s easy to figure out. Took about 30 mins to assemble it. So far me and my two cockatiels love it. Plenty of space for them. I would recommend this cage for cockatiels, lovebirds, and parakeets only. Anything bigger would be able to bend the bars easily. I bought this cage for my new Indian Ringneck baby before she came home. It was packaged nicely with extra padding on the sides, and the contents were in great shape. The only modification I had to do was push down one of the door loops with vice grips because the door wouldn't close. There were no bent wires, nothing missing, etc. It says that it requires two people to put together, but I put it together by myself. It wasn't difficult to put together, just very particular in the order you must put the parts together in. You have to install the dowel perches (I only used two and wrapped them in vet wrap because babies are clumsy) BEFORE you put the front panels on. This is a very nice cage. I like the fact that it is on rollers and can be easily moved for sweeping. I moved my Parakeet from his little cage that he HATED into this and he loved it right from the beginning!  He was an only budgie, but this cage was so nice and roomy that I got him a friend.  They really like it.. At one point I had three parakeets in there, but one of them died so now there are only two.  But there is plenty of room if you have multiple birds.  This is a LARGE cage, so make sure you have plenty of room for it! ", "My birds love this.  Definitely need two people to put together.  Make sure your slide out tray is on the right way before adding sides.  I put mine on backwards and didn't  realize until the cage was completely finished.  I left if that way!  Two of my plastic perch feeders were broken where they connect to the cage.  I just used the other two.  Instructions were short and simple just make sure all of your doors open to the out side before assembly. I like the cage but it was hard to put together, no parts were labeled. I also have a few missing parts which I have to report. This is plenty big for all my finches After reading other reviews I thought that it would be hard to assemble but my son put together for me in under an hour. I love it my birds think they are in heaven. Although it is not Black more of a grey but looks good anyway. My only complaint would be the instructions that came with it the print was very small and hard to read, that is why I gave it only four stars. It came late because UPS had lost it but well worth the wait. This cage is awesome! I love the spring doors....and more importantly, my 2 Parakeets are having a blast!! A solid and very attractive cage! Great value for the money, more than enough room for 3 cockatiels, side doors need to be secured though The cage is easy to clean and provides my budgie a lot of flight space, but when assembling it, a hole I needed to align part of the cage wall into was entirely missing. It took some drilling to make our own hole before continuing assembly. Over all it is a nice cage for the money. The directions are not that easy to understand but I was able to figure it out This has worked out great for my parakeets.  It fairly large but fits nicely in a corner of my kitchen.  You can easily wheel this around for easy vacuuming/cleaning.  My two little guys love being able to spread their wings and fly throughout the cage.  Made only for non-destructive birds for the bars are very thin.  Assembly was easy. I have a sun conure and it has a lot of room to fly and play shes always happy because i was able to put lots of toys and bowls of food and water, just a fun house to move things around for my feather beautiful happy birdy companion. A very good bargain! ", "Just got my budgies in it tonight. Looks great.  Definitely can\u2019t assemble alone so have a helper. Big cage for five parakeets (I have 14 parakeets).  The five birds are new babies and they love flying around inside.  The cage arrived with two broken food bowls and a cracked bottom tray but the manufacturer promptly replaced them at no charge. AMAZING especially for price. Contrary you what other people wrote I had a fun time assembling it.  I'm so happy that my cockateil has that much room now and I'm bird sitting a friends parakeet who actually flies a little in this cage!  Would definitely recommend. I needed a cage due to an accident that resulted in four babies. I went in with trepidation after reading quite a few of the other reviews. This cage is a really good size for my two finches.  The wire gauge and spacing is perfect for these small birds.  I love the 6 little spring doors, there is no way my little birds could open them.  The cage is sturdy enough that my cat can't break in or tip it over. Being able to pull out the mess drawer AND the wire cage floor is really important to be able to clean it without a lot of fuss.  The price for this cage is really great too, other ones similar to this are at least 1 and 1/2 times or twice the cost. Definitely need two people to assemble and the assembly is kind of a pain in the butt. Once it is made it\u2019s fantastic though. Finally was able to give my lovebird more room. This cage is great. Ive been wanting to upgrade and so glad I did. Now I have 4 parakeets. It looks so good in my living room and is so easy to clean.Tray and grate pull out seperatly and easily. There are a few side doors that I put little clips on becuase they have no locking device. The many little doors makes very easy access for food water and toys. Quality product at a great price. If i could give zero stars i would.  I bought this cage for our new bird. We assembled the cage and put all our toys in only to find that theres a broken bar that wasnt soldered well and is poking out of cage.  This cage is less than poorly made and didnt even last long enough to put the bird in it.  This is a dangerous cage for birds. None Very large cage for smaller type birds.. a African grey will get out though ", "Wasn't hard to put together at all, very solid and didn't encounter any of the problems I read in other reviews. Great cage for not much money. Loved the cage and so do my 3 cockatiels . Was fairly easy to put together so that was great. Put it together in less then one hour with the help of someone else . Loved the little feeding trays included . Love all the doors that this cage has . I have 2 budgies that I got almost 3 years ago and they've been cramped on the cage they came with ever since. It was super small especially now that they're both grown up and I felt so bad. I got attracted to this product because it's a fairly huge and it's cheap for it's size compare to other cages I've seen. So I ordered it on Jan 18 and it came Jan 21st which was great because the estimated ship date was Feb 15. Needless to say that this cage is AMAZING! its wrought iron so its more heavy duty than my previous one. It was easy to assemble and hardly got any problems at all. There's alot of doors so you you can reach in easier for cleaning and such. The wheels are great so I can take them to the living room in the day and roll them to my room at night. I really do love this cage and I recommend this to anyone that's looking for a replacement. One thing though is that some of the holes that's been punched have the little pieces still attached to it so the screw wouldn't go in. But nothing that a nail and hammer can't do :) But before you order this, make sure you have the room for it. Thanks for this ever making amazing cage!!! Sturdy cage.  Great for my two parakeets.  My cat has laid on top under the cage cover and the cage doesn't seem bothered the birds a different story. I love this cage very much, I got it for my pet rats. The only problem I\u2019ve had with it is that lining up some of the pieces when assembly was extremely hard, took multiple tries and multiple people to put together. Other than that I\u2019ve loved this cage. Works but the item came with parts that should have been welded and were not. Assembly was not very fun but you are getting an inexpensive bird cage. Great quality and easy assembly. Ours houses 5 parakeets. Great price compared to local big box stores. Not bad to put together. Latches not good. Tray can drop out when you don\u2019t want it to. Seed goes everywhere.  Wanted more room for cockatiels.  Wouldn\u2019t buy again. I have had this cage for almost 4 years now. It is still in good condition and my birds love it. I would never recommend anyone to buy pet store cages , because of their small size and expensive tag. PLEASE buy this for your birds, don't restrain them to a small cage, where they can't spread their wings and explore. Overall good cage for the price. 2 pieces we're bended, but I still was able to put it together.building it was pretty easy.overall very happy with it. ", "putting it together was really at ask, you do need 2 people to put together. It took me 2 hours plus and if I had another There's nothing even remotely wrought iron about this cage, but for the price I expected that to be a marketing lie. That said, it is a nice, large cage, and assembly was easy. Unfortunately the design leaves a bit to be desired. The spacing on the bars doesn't match up with the spacing on the feed cups, making them awkward to fill and clean. For the price I'm happy with the cage. I love this cage, but I probably wouldn't have purchased it if I had read the reviews first. Yes, it did take two people to assemble -- but that is often the case when putting items together. Yes, the welding didn't hold on one of the tines, but it doesn't affect the cage integrity. My only real complaint is that the tray in the bottom of the cage is difficult to slide into place and doesn't stay in place. I've solved this by storing extra care items in a plastic container that sits on the bottom shelf and is just the right height to hold the tray in place. Not the perfect solution, but it works. Most importantly, my parakeets love the space they now have. So all-in-all, I'm very happy with this product. Love the cage Mike to Quaker parrots absolutely love the size gave it to four only because the instructions are too big to understand and you have to figure it out on your own other than that I would buy it again We have 4 parakeets and we love this cage. It gives them so much room and they love it!! Very easy to set up and every easy to clean!! Very happy with this purchase!! i love the flight cage because it  is so huge for one.  i don't have to worry about my parakeets being all crowded in a small cage,; they have plenty of room to fly around.  its's also convenient with all the different spots on which you can enter the cage from any direction in the upper/lower area.  i would recommend it to one and all.  i had to have assistance from my daughter when it came to putting the sides up.  the instruction tells you ahead of time that it may take two people.  got it together within an hour.  love it. This cage is 0retty big. Bought it for my cockatiel. Actually planning on having 3 cockatiel in it. It's very spacious and roomy. The panels were slightly bent so more difficulty to put together. No instructions, but was able to figure it out and assemble within 2-3 hours.  Cage was good size and rolled pretty well.  Sizes have spring-loaded access doors, so I had to wire them shut to keep my bird from escaping. I am female, 63 yrs young.  It took a while to put together by myself.  I might suggest another pair of hands for assembling.  Nice cage.  Larger than I expected but nice features. My Lovebirds won't know what to do with all the room. ", "Arrived quickly in perfect condition and was really easy to put together. Dropped a star because one of the plastic feeding cups broke immediately...but I wasn't planning to use them anyhow. Overall it's a great cage and my two quakers seem quite happy. This XL cage is definitely super big! I\u2019ll add a new nesting box inside and hopefully my pair of cockatiels will make some babies again :) This cage is exactly what I wanted for my scarlet chested grasskeets and bourke parakeet! It gives them plenty of room to play and be active... especially on the random days that I can't let them out to fly around. I also love that it's very affordable and the quality is awesome!! I would not recommend this cage for birds larger than a rosella, conure, or other similar sized birds because the cage bars are not thick enough to withstand the beak strength of a larger parrot. None This cage is made of good quality and is an excellent value for the money.  My birds have more than enough room to party.  The water and food trays could use a design change as the birds make a mess with the food.  I would like some type of catch tray at the bottom of the cage to catch airborne bird seed.  Otherwise, this is a great cage.  The instructions are almost useless, but it was easy to assemble by viewing the photo.  The measurements are exact.  This is a big cage, so make sure you have the room for it. I ordered this cage a few months back and loved it. I hit reorder to get a second for a bird I just rescued.  What arrived was not the same cage but a similar one. The screws were stripped, 2 sides were bent, and one of the bird perches had a split in it.  You would think a quality control person would have caught this prior to shipping. Very disappointed this was nicer in person than I imagined. It was easy to assemble and one person was able to do it. Overall very nice cage, the only thing I don't like is the food and water bowls don't fit in between all of the columns. You have to move them around to find out where they fit best. Nice cage. Biggest issue was a bolt was malformed so I had to find an alternative and one of the food containers was broken. My two finch love the space though. Makes me feel better that they now have the ability to stretch their wings. Bought this for my lovebirds, they seem to love it. Its very spacious and i espciallylove that it has wheels that allow me to take the cage out during the day and putting it back inside at night. Missing bolts needed to hold cage together. Every peice came bent so had to rebend by hand. Not worth the money i spent on it. ", "Spacious, well made and reasonable priced. Assembly manual is a bit confusing, but that's nothing, you'll assemble it just once! Great cage my cockatiels love it. Plenty of room for them as well. Love that it\u2019s on wheels so it\u2019s easily movable to clean under Love this cage! I have 2 for my 4 birds. It's a great size for pairs or small families of anything from a sun conure size down. There's plenty of space for extra perches, hanging toys, food dishes. I like the slide out bottom tray. Makes for easy cleaning - you don't have to open the cage to get to it. Great product at a reasonable price. Big enough for my 2 \ud83e\udd9c with space to fly around. Perfect for my daughters baby! Easy to put together. Beautiful cage. Came in a day sooner than expected. Been wanting to get a flight cage for my parakeets and finally got this one. So far it is working out well.Only have it setup for 2 weeks. Easy to assemble and very big.  I have no complaints at all.  The instructions say it should take two to assemble.  Maybe so but I did it with only me and it wasn't too difficult at all.  Regular masking tape suffices as my third hand when needed.  The instructions are exactly what one would expect.  Probably written in Mongolian first then translated to Chinese northern then Chinese southern then English.  If you use your imagination and a little common sense they are quite understandable. This is a great cage. The wires are flexible, you can bend them very easily with your fingers. Took about 45 minutes to set up by myself. Look, we have 11 parakeets. This cage is so big it's probably too much room for the beauties but they love it. It is such a nice cage. Very much worth it. Awsome well worth the money I have 5 parakeets in this cage I could probably get 10 more it's huge well worth the money. Very well built little hard to put together definitely need two people job but I had it up and birds in the cage with in an hour I love it. Bernie in the summer I can roll it on my deck such a nice deal. Love my new cage thanks for a great product. ", "This cage comes with barley any instruction, and is super hard. When I got the package a piece was bent. Amazon was amazing and sent me one next day but in all of the joints it had medal still in it so it was hard to put the prices together. My four parakeets LOVE this home! It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and easy to roll out of the way for vacuuming underneath. We added a wooden play set & bird bath on the top of the cage because they are some free-range budgies and enjoy the outside of the cage just as much as the inside! Very happy! This is the best buy we have purchased for our birds. It is such a joy to watch them flying and enjoying the new freedom that their smaller areas didn't offer. I recommend highly recommend this product not only for the value, but for the health and happiness of your birds. Cage is structurally sound for a sleeping cage for a small primate. Only complaint is how close the bottom tray is to bars, enabling him to pull up and eat newspaper. Knowing parrots, it'd be a problem for them as well. Otherwise great buy for the price! Please ignore that \"well\" -> this app is being a little wonky and not allowing to delete: well.. This cage is well worth the money, my little birds are flying around in it, and love it, they're happy, they chirp and play in there all the time, I also purchased they're toys from Amazon, great cage, for the price, we're very happy.. Thank you Amazon, My parakeet is markedly happier since getting this cage set up for her. It's really huge for a keet and she knows the space is all hers. It comes with three long perches, but I recommend buying toys like hanging bells to put inside the cage as well so that your bird can fully enjoy the space and it won't feel empty to them. I am so happy with the flight cage.  I had no problem putting it together by myself although a second pair of hands would lessened the time.  I have 2 parakeets and they are loving their new cage.  I truly believe that if people are going to own birds of any kind, then the bird should be as comfortable as possible.  This cage exceeded my expectations and the price is incredible.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase and your birds will be happy as well. Large cage is ehh. 2 wires on top were extremely bent. I straightened them the best i could but the metal is so stretched theirs still a bad bow. Same goes for the bottom pan that slides out. Can see both imperfections in pics. For the price i expected something a little better quality or at least better inspected thru quality control. It will do tho. Probably would recommend. My budgie escapes out the spring doors. Was easy to put together and is a good size. But I had to zip tie the side doors. Plenty of room for a starling sized bird. Enough doors on 3 sides to easily clean the cage and place items such as water/food dishes, birdbath, and floor coverings. The only think I'd change - and only because I take the cage outdoors onto our deck and bring it back in daily, is that I'd put \"balloon\" type wheels instead of solid plastic wheels. Balloon type wheels would navigate the cracks/spaces between the deck boards better. ", "This was as advertised, but there were some quality issues.  The machining was poor.  One hole was drilled horizontally that should have been drilled vertically.  Luckily, we had a power drill- otherwise we would have been in a difficult situation.  The food cups are also very cheaply made.  They do not fit in properly, the clips are flimsy plastic, and one of the cups arrived missing the clips to hold it to the cage entirely. Just received this beauty from Amazon and Prevue got it spot on! This wrought iron cage is powder coated a dark pewter shade which makes it an awesome addition to the house. The instructions seemed a bit slight until you look at the parts and they are mostly self explanatory. One little problem with the instructions we worded out was \"Don't put the casters on when they say.\" The cage rolls about in a very hard to control way, wait till finished and put them on last. Bought this for a baby mockingbird after he had outgrown his first cage.  Needed something large enough for him to exercise his wings in preparation for release.  This worked perfectly.  In it's second incarnation, with some interior modifications, it became a temporary home for rescued kittens.  My plan was to get some finches, but the two kittens, now cats, are still very attached to their old home, frequently sleeping on top.  So, probably no finches, yet. I have 3 of these cages . They hold my sugar gliders and they are very happy in them . Lots of room and very easy to keep clean . Metal grates of the cage were packaged in plastic which kept them from being all scratched up but one panel was warped and another panel had bent wires.  The 4 plastic food/water dishes were just thrown into the box loose and one was broken.  The cage seems to be a bit flimsy but instructions for putting it together were good.  For the price it is okay. Your birds will be disoriented when you place them in the cage because they can really stretch their wings and fly! This is a very large cage, and is a good price.  I assembled it by myself without trouble.  I house doves in this cage, so I don't use the bottom grill because they like to walk around on the bottom a lot.  I just put the pan into the upper slot, what should be for the grill.  This cage is for docile birds like finches or doves; it wouldn't do for parrots because the doors open too easily. Everything was easy to assemble & I didn't need help to do it. Really nice large cage. Well made and rolls easy. Parts were all wavy and not straight, not sure if it's from manufacturing or shipping.  This made it harder to put together.  Also, the pan was cracked but Amazon gave me a partial refund for that. ", "Nice cage, exactly as pictured. Sturdy enough! Easy to see in and enjoy our birds. Love this cage! I used this cage for the iguana for outside sun bathing work and looks great !the quality is good There were some bars that were bent :( The cage is pretty nice, but its really hard to get things situated in it.  Birds seem to like it and that's all that matters, but its easy to clean and has enough room for toys, their food and extra perches.  it does need more clasps for the doors as it has several doors that you cant latch and they don't have a spring to them in keeping the doors closed.  Other than that, its a nice cage I bought this cage for my green cheek conure.  It's a great size for him with lots of climbing room.  The only drawback is the cups won't stay put, not a flaw with the cage, the bird is just a jerk.  He has plenty of room and lots of toys.  It does take 2 people to put it together.  Thinking of getting another for my parakeet. I bought this cage for our 4 Budgies. This was just what we wanted. Plenty of room for the toys and they can easily fly around. The wheels make it nice and easy to move. Simple to put together and very well made. This is a very nice cage. I am very pleased. It did take my husband and I about 2 hours to put it together. My bird is used to a large enclosure so I can't speak for her but so far she seems to be adjusting. She is a large conure(Patagonian). A bird any bigger than this might not be comfortable in this cage This will be much easier to keep clean. Also all pieces were in perfect shape. Took about an hour to put together, if you don\u2019t like IKEA you\u2019re not gonna like this one either. Great Cage My Parakeets Enjoy It, Just Instructions Were Alittle Weird But if you have expierence building stuff and figuring out on your own you won\u2019t have a problem Super deal for the price. After reading some of the negative reviews,  I was marginally worried that we would receive a dud...BUT wrong-o. Perfect condition, easy to assemble if you have 2 people, and exactly as advertised.  Very happy with this cage. ", "Well made, easy instructions to put together, great price for a VERY large cage.  Not meant for larger parrots as the bars are smaller and probably not strong enough to contain them.  Very well suited for parakeets, canaries, finches, even cockatiels. The cage is absolutely huge. You could fit an amazon in there and it would still have room. I have a small fancy green cheek conure. The only problem is, is that on the sides the doors do not have clasps or anything to make sure they stay shut. If you're looking for a big cage at a good price this is great. I fixed this problem by putting some of my birds toys on the door and the cage and secured them. I also used bread ties. It's a great cage, takes awhile to put up but very easy and simple! Your bird will love you if you get this. Awesome price for a bird cage! My budgies have plenty of room! Definitely a cage for smaller birds! The only problem I had was that one of the feeders clips that hold it the cage broke off and I would want it replaced! But all in all its a good deal! The pet store cage was much smaller and more expensive! I got the XL cage and this cage is fantastic. My green cheek doesnt know what to do with all his space. His old cage looked so crowded with those toys. Now it looks like I need to get him more. Was time consuming to put together but well worth it! The cage is amazing quality very big and steerdy!! My bird loves it!! Easy to assemble. My cage came with all the screws and was just as described. It is sturdy and has a lot of room for my bird. My only complaint is that it has these doors where my bird can easily open and get out. I fixed it with just adding clips on the side. I gave the cage a four because out of the six swing doors on this cage only four opened and two were welded closed. Also for Me this whole cage is to low to the ground and I own a cat that always tried to climb the cage. And if you own a sugar glider they might be able to squeeze through the gaps between each level of the cage. It is a big cage great for Birds. It would have gotten a higher score had it come with better instructions. It was missing a couple of holes for some of the prongs to go into. One of the holes that the screws goes into is missing. Once I got it assembled it's a nice cage for price. My parakeet and dove love it. Very thin wires so I wouldn't put anything bigger than a small conure in it. But aside from assembling its satisfactory We are happy with the Prevue F050 cage that we already have so we bought a second cage. The second cage however looks like it was through a war. The box had numerous holes and one leg was damaged beyond repair, on fact there was parts protruding from the box. I can't say for sure that the protruding part was the damaged leg. However it all worked out for the best as Prevue will replace the damaged parts. This product came with unfinished parts leading me to zip tie the cage together! This is junk, contacted the manufacturer and have heard nothing for 3 days now. I would have immediately returned this if it wasn\u2019t urgently needed. Amazon was listed as seller and shipper but have no way to directly contact them! ", "This is a great cage for my sugar gliders - lots of room to glide around.  A couple of spaces around the edge and on top were a little larger than others.  Ok for my older gliders, but for the younger one I just simply zip tied some small dowels around top edges outside of cage.  No big deal to do at all.  Well worth the price.  Sturdy cage. This has turned out to be an awesome purchase because my parakeets feel very happy in this cage. They have plenty of space to move about and  to fly around plus they do not fight like they used to. Extremely happy with the fact that it was very simple to assemble the cage. I recommend this cage to folks that have more than 4 birds!!!!!  Your birds will last longer living in this cage, that's a fact. The hardest part was definitely assembly you might need two people to assemble it but it is a easy to clean cage it is Great for budgies and it is  very sturdy, I can see this cage lasting a very long time. My keets love the new  cage. It is so much larger than I thought it would be. The only reason I did not give  it 5 stars is because the shelf is way too low. It is almost touching the floor. They could raise it so you could actually use the shelf. It does not fit the container of food or my basket that holds bird supplies and my dog can actually look I to the cage which ha  me worried. I am afraid he may scare them to death. Great cage... except the springs on the doors, could injury your bird. Wow! This cage is huge!! Definitely need at least 2 people to assemble. Sturdy and roomy and OMG, I ordered it on Wednesday and it arrived Friday -- and I live in Hawaii!! I give it 4 out of 5 because one of the joints is faulty: the screw has nothing to grab onto. Other than that, I'm very pleased. Excellent cage for the price! Plenty of space. Easy to clean. Easy to move. My conure loves it! Cheap wheels bend when you try to roll. We like to put our parrot outside on nice days. I bought one of these cages in July and it was relatively easy to assemble and all the parts were intact. I recently needed an additional cage so I ordered another one. Big mistake!! The second cage had holes on the frame that were not drilled through the entire piece  where the screws needed to go, parts were bent and one of the feeder trays was broken into three pieces. Fortunately I had a drill and was able to finish drilling the holes and I have requested a replacement tray.  I don't know if it will be replaced or not. It takes two people to put together but it is easy. Easy to clean and move around. My birds love it. ", "Great cage. Can't say enough good things about it. Great value. Very sturdy and large. I have looked at many pet stores before finding this one and comparable cages were priced at $250 and above. Overall an amazing deal. Would definitely recommend! My cockatiels are very happy and comfortable. Really need two people to assemble. Other than that the cage works well. My parakeet is thrilled with the room as he can fly some without hitting his wings. Took out the rack in bottom and placed paper there. Bottom tray wipes clean easily! If I had room my two parrotlets would have one too. For the price, can't beat it! We just bought this cage to move our 5 quaker parrots into after they had been in two separate smaller cages for years. They love it. It is more than enough room for all five together, and they mostly just hang out in the top anyway. The bottom tray is so light and easy to take out to sift their litter. If you have multiple small birds such as parakeets or budgies, this is the perfect cage. Assembly was easy too, my husband and I finished it in maybe 20 minutes. Very nice cage.  Study and stable. My 2 cockatiels loved it! It\u2019s big and has so much room! The spring side doors caused a little concern but adding some clips fixed that problem! Definitely worth the money! Assembly was not that complicated did on my own in less than an hour! My birds had babies and needed a bigger cage. This is awesome! Only time and wear will tell if this product can last but so far, the size and ease in assembly is very good. The method of assembly is quite intuitive. I do have complaint about the packaging/box was damaged during shipment. I have read other purchasers revel the same issue. Only problem really after unpacking, was a rod that slide into sleeve was bent and wouldn't fit. I used pliers and screwdriver to force it back so the rod would fit. The plastic bowls were all intact. All loose pieces were smartly packaged in plastic bags and easy to find. The wheels were surprisingly better then expected, they are round, ball bearing wheels. Easy to put together and a great size for the finches that live in it. It doesn't need all the feeding dishes, but has plenty of room for a few live plants, which the birds seem to enjoy. I ordered this cage for my daughters two cockatiels. She had no problems setting it up by herself. It is very large and good quality .It even has space for the bird food and other items under the bottom tray. She is happy with it and so are the birds. Best cage ever for my parakeets. ", "Took about 35 to 40 minutes after laying out the parts and reading the instructions. Our first cage was bent and broken by Fed Ex after they slammed it down on our porch,so I met the Fed Ex guy at the truck as he pulled up . Great cage for the money. It took me about 45 min to put together by myself. Could be tricky for someone else alone to put together. I have four parakeets in mine and plenty of room. They love it, I keep just a couple of perches in the bottom part and they get down there to fly. They have a blast in it. And I keep all the toys and food, water containers in the upper half. we love this brand new cage we got for our new birds I totally recommend but we did have some problems cause we had to drill our own holes cause the cage did not come up with them but overall the cage was great My zebra finches love it! I like that there are so many doors making getting inside very easy. I am very pleased with this product. The only issue I've had with it is that it arrived with one of the dishes broken, but I contacted Prevue and received a replacement promptly and without any hassle. My bird loves this cage.  She was trying to nest chronically and would constantly climb to the bottom of her previous cage to shred paper through the wire grate on the bottom.  I needed to change up her environment and purchased this cage.  She took to it very quickly and loves all of the space.  It's so big I think she's too lazy now to go all of the way to the bottom.  I'm 5'2'' and it stands above me.  It is very easy to clean.  I love the shelf-- it provides a spot to store all of my bird's food and other accessories.  The wheels make it very easy to move so I can vacuum.  I would buy it again for sure. Hi everyone. I will totally recommend this item. Great quality and I think the price is the best. Not only they send me the bird cage but they also send me 3 sticks for the birds to stand up and 4 little plates to put their food. Love it. This cage is for my new family. My ringneck birds had their first babies.\ud83d\udc25\u2764\ufe0f Directions spot on didn't take long to put up. Definetly need more than one person. Only thing my slide tray has a crack in top left corner. Still usable but would like to replace it in case cracks more. Other than that truly love the cage it's space and room for my 4 parakeets. Love the cage. Fast at shipping. Update: This cage is very low quality.  Do not buy it.  It is not worth the hassle of putting together or the poor quality.  The cage is already rusting in several spots which caused some of the support bolts to weaken.  The bottom grate and tray keep falling out and it is not safe.  Spend the money on something with better construction. A little bit of a puzzle putting it together, but once assembled, I've been very happy with this product.  My birds are even happier, now they can get the exercise they need for good health.  It was delivered quickly and everything was in the box...I ended up ordering a second one. ", "the issues on the cage top was not correct,but once the cage was assembled ,I did what I could do to hide the issues on top of cage.lots of room for our 3 birds to have room to fly. Cage was a bit hard to put together on my own. I highly suggest having someone with you to help when you put it together!  I really like it, but my only pet peeve is that he large doors are on the bottom of the cage rather than the top, so it's extremely hard to get to my bird, who prefers to stay at the top part of the cage. Worst!!! My father (a mechanical engineer) was helping me put this together and it was hell on earth. To make matters worse, there were multiple locations that were not drilled correctly so we couldn't even get the screws in!! Cage materials were flimsy and bent, there's no way this is wrought iron. I'm so disappointed...I bought this so my cat wouldn't be able to knock down my budgie's cage... It\u2019s worth every penny. I highly recommend this cage. It was not easy to put together though. My two budgies are quite contend. Good cage for my parakeets but doesn't lock well on the doors or feed openings. A bigger bird could easily push the doors open or unlatch the main doors. I breed American budgies, and boy does this cage do the trick. I have this cage and one 18x18x30 cage. This is the PERFECT flight cage for my little budgies! The only problem I saw was that one of the bars on the top panel wasn't welded correctly, but this can easily be fixed with some crazy glue. And apart of the top was a bit bent but we worked around it. Overall it is a freakin' awesome cage! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! For the price this is a very nice bird cage.  It goes together very easily, maybe 10 minutes of assembly time.  It is very sturdy.  Only complaint that I have is that the bottom tray insert is not the correct size - too small.  Pretty annoying, had to throw it out. Came today a little hard for me to put together. But it came out nice,and my lizard likes it now I'm working on decorating it. So my lizard can spend more time outside with me. I'm so glad I bought this cage.  Easy assembly.  Sturdy cage.  My cockatiels sang so happily when I moved them in. I love the cage so much it was so much fun assembling and my 4 cockatiels love it! HOWEVER, upon arrival one of the feeder cups was broken on the hinge where you hang it up to the cage. Now one of my cockatiels has to eat out of a different feeder and feels left out. Really wish they sold a replacement. Oh well. ", "I love this cage. It includes all your bird needs for the first days. A little annoying to put together but was expected with it being the size it is. The only problem is that I would've preferred there be a large door on the top half so that I can hang the birds toys more easily and position the perches more directly. The cage itself is solid, its made of decent sturdy metal, but don't expect solid steel or iron/bronze. The cage is lightweight enough that pushing and pulling is easily done and the wheels means I don't have to rattle the cage to move it. There's enough room in it to fit either two to three large birds like parrots with enough play room, or several smaller birds should you want a nice colony of them. Very Very Nice Cage. Just prefect period. I received my cage in two days. From the first piece of tape cut to open box to the cage being fully assembled and where it was going to sit took 40 minutes by myself to assemble. The cage is nice and perfect for our four parakeets. I recommend this cage with no negative thoughts toward it. Extremely easy assembly by one person. GREAT size, super easy to move around (even on carpet), and shipped SUPER fast.  Highly recommend. I use it for a single cockatiel and she is in heaven with all her new space.  So nice to see her spread her wings so easily.  And it was simple to put together (did it by myself).  Only drawback are the spring-hinged side doors - she doesnt bother with them but a more energetic bird could easily push them open. My lovebirds just love this cage. I am so glad I chose this cage. It is so large and spaciouse. I bought one of these for my Society Finches, who were housed with my Zebra Finches and were hating life.  Recently, I became a parental unit(SNL) to a lost and scared Parakeet, whom I had to put in my small isolation cage.  I quickly added a second Parakeet to keep the first one happy and then realized they were hating life in that small cage.  I bought my second cage for them.  I love these cages, as I can roll them around so that they are getting lots of sunshine.  These cages are easy to clean and have lots of room to add all of the toys the parakeets can handle. Directions to be a little bit better but other than that it is a great product Nice cage with plenty of access for cleaning, etc. The instructions could have been better, the pictures are often too small to distinguish which panel they are actually discussing in the instructions. I use this cage for my black capped conure to play in during the day when he is not exploring. He loves to climb and play with the toys he has. ", "This thing is huge!! Love it and so does my one lone sugar glider.  He will be getting a friend very soon. I contacted the mfg.  R1, L1 (legs) had the tray slot welded on upside down so there is no way to have the lower try and the screen in at the same time.  they are sending me replacement parts and are aware of the issue. Roomy for our little zebra finches My canary loves it. Easy to put together and it looks good when finished! Now to go out and get some goodies to finish it off. Two of the feeders arrived broken and one of the partitions was bent and rcvd. only 2 perches. It's a beautiful cage and I can't wait to give our birds their new home! My budgies actually stretch their wings and fly a little, much more vocal and busy talking.  Cage is wicked hard to clean though Nice cage, packaging was a mess and hard to get into. Took about 30 minutes to assemble. Needed a bit of force to get pieces to fit. Excellent cage and sweet price For the price this cage is awesome.  We have several finches and they have enough room to fly around.  FYI, if you have more than 4 finches, make sure you add more perches so that they don't fight each other.  1 perch for every two birds is just perfect. I have 2 parakeets we keep in this cage and it's like a bird mansion! Bar spacing is great for them they can not fit out. It's a pain to build but I did it myself without help from my husband and it only took about 1.5 hours lol ", "I have had this cage several months now. i am 66 yrs old and in a wheelchair wit little use of my right arm. I LOVE THIS CAGE! I did need someone to assemble it which took about 30 mins. and was not complicated. directions and diagrams were easy to follow. This cage is HUGE and my year old Cockatiel just loves it. This cage is easierfor me to maintain than the little parakeet cage i used to have which i had to pull and tug with my good arm to get the bottom tray out clean. THIS one is SO EASY for me! The bottom slides out so smoothly. i cover itwith paper towels so i just roll them up with the seeds and messes my bird makes, toss them in the trash and reline with fresh paper towels. Thats easiest for me. There are other easy ways to clean it in other reviews that are great as well. The tray is very large of course but INCREDIBLY LIGHT so i can put it in and out with my one good arm.And the cage is on wheels so it can be moved room to room or even outside! Kind of cheaply built, but will work for the price. My 2 parakeets love all the room they have to fly around. It is perfect. Thank you. Very nice sturdy cage. Easy to put together solo. Great size cage I've bought two of these and am about to order a third. Some is partly bent, but not badly enough to effect putting it together. Check for sharp spots before putting your animal into it. You can file them down Definitely easier to assemble with two people.  Not a spendy cage but nice. My Birdie is Happy and so am I he loves having a bigger cage. I love all the little doors all over the cage. Didn't come with instructions but i put it together by myself. My bird loves it and it's very sturdy Great cage for a great price, houses my doves and easily cleanable. Very spacious as it is for parrots but works even better with smaller birds. Definitely recommend! ", "I really like this flight cage for the price. The only issue I had was that one of the holes was not drilled out right because I had to put a screw in diagonally to get it to catch. But other than that it is great. My 4 parakeets love it, lots of room for them. The shelf on bottom is nice too. For the price and size its ok. I bought it for my two sugar gliders and it works. But it did come with a part of it not fully welded on the top, and most of the doors on the sides are welded shut, which is fine for me since i zip-tie them closed anyway. The side doors also don't have a lock on them they just swing open. The size and quality are great at any price but for $88 it is a steal.  As others have noted the instructions could be larger with parts labeled but I had no problems assembling within 30 minutes.  I did have one side piece that had 2 holes on the wrong side but it was easy to drill them through.  11 Finch's love their new home! Quite dispointed! On One of the two back panels, found the wire mesh is broken and a bit blended. One of the feed bailed is also broken and can not be hanged on the cage.  These damage were  not caused by shipping and packing problem, they were defective and seller either did not mentioned it or didn't do a quality control check! The birds still scream in the morning at the same top corner so I\u2019d say this cage seems to suit their needs. first cage received broken, replacement cage received broken, after 2 broken cages we  decided to keep 2nd broken cage, I would suggest buying from another vendor entirely, product claims to be wrought iron, I don't know what it is made from but it is certainly not wrought iron. Definitely not worth the money. As listed I was soooo worried when reading these reviews. I was so anxious waiting for it to arrive. I am a breeder and have purchased many cages - assembled at least 50 and this was by far the worst. The design is flimsy at best and outright dangerous for small birds like finches or parakeets. The bar spacing is listed as 1/2 inch - however - at the points where two panels meet there are bigger gaps. The screw holes on my cage were often drilled at an angle which made assembly very difficult. The bottom legs are slightly crooked and it took some major strength to force apart far enough for the bottom shelf assembly. The door closures are a joke: a metal rod  that slides up - I know that many birds will eventually figure out how to open their cage or get their bands caught on the rod. Perfect little big flight cage! My whole family approves. ", "Easy to assemble and nice, high quality.  The doors and openings are conveniently located for easy access to different parts of the cage.  FYI the bottom has the same as the sides, so you can't keep quail etc. in the bottom. Great cage for Birdie!!! Great Cage for a Great Price..... Parakeet loves it....... I love the size of this cage for price .my girls ( two cockatiels) are really enjoying their new play house :) however be very carful with the feed trays the prongs break extremely easy :( but r great other than that.  I has a couple wires that wasn't welded right either and that aggravated me to pieces one  was not welded good on the tray at the bottom and two more on the small wiring in the bk but honestly u can't  tell and it's still safe and I'm the only one who knows because I set it up . All in all I would repurchase if was asked so yes I recommend it.  I couldn't get the petstore to order this exact cage for the price  don't forget your coupon ;) oh it's also easy to clean and all the doors are very handy . I bought two cages for my pollitos! And it's perfect!! The assembly wasn't that difficult, but I do recommend at least do it with an extra person. The size is perfect for my cockatiels. I do think that in one cage is enough for four or five cockatiels, I'm happy with this product! While a very good bird cage the instructions leave a lot of lacking as it was very difficult at first to assemble as the pieces are not marked or labeled Thank you Amazon I know those kind of aviary cages go for hundreds of dollars God bless and your wonderful company love shopping and saving money We ordered the large one and it is pretty big it's not bad for the price it's sturdy my sugar gliders love it it was really actually easy to put it together there were no damages to anything in the Box everything came out perfectly fine Great Cage for the price, amazed on how easy to put together. My 9 year old Son and I put together and only took less than 30 minutes. Our 4 Parakeets Love this cage and plenty room. Perfect cage and size for the price.My 3 indian ring necks love it!Just one of the dish trays was broken when it arrived. ", "I received this cage on April 21st. Two lovebirds are housed in the cage. The bottom tray has already broken, only had a sheet and millet seed in a small bag. Nice cage for the price. I purchased to use for Sugar gliders. The little doors on side can be open by them, so had to Zip tie them shut. It doesn\u2019t seem to be very sturdy/hardy, but it works for the price. In a bind, I\u2019d buy it again I'd buy it again! A bit difficult to put together, but not all that bad. Perfect cage for my crazy kakariki! I ordered the XL ones and it's so much room. Great cage! Very sturdy construction and excellent design.  I put it together in my livingroom by myself with no problem.  The only time I needed assistance was when a panel needed a little support while tightening the bolt, but I used a bread bag twistie to hold the panels together temporarily.  For the price, this is a really great buy. I just got this today. Shiping was fast. Was concerned at first as the box was tore up butnall parts were fine. Easy to put together. 30 min top. My budgies are sooooo happy singning and chirriping.  LOVE THIS CAGE You can't beat this cage for the price. My 2 parakeets and conure like the extra space. The wheels allow you to move it around easily. Is it a high quality cage, no, but it works and looks good. Takes forever to put together... But love it..  :-) What I especially like about this cage is all the doors both large and small.  Another type of cage I have has one large door in the middle of the front and one small door on each end.  The Prevue cage has two large doors on the front and 3 small ones on each end.  It makes it so easy to reach food containers and clean perches.  I really would like another if I had room. EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! I hope my new birds take advantage of all their space! You can fit several parakeets in here, and larger birds too. Easy to put together, decent quality- especially for the price. I honestly love it. As long as the birds all get along, this is ideal. The next best thing to an actual \"walk in\" aviary. ", "I bought this to give my 3 parakeets room to fly around. They mostly stick to the top part of the cage, but there is plenty of room and they do enjoy it. They cage includes some great food dishes and the assembly is easy to follow. Great cage for the price. Would purchase from them in the future. Love that it's on wheels. easy to roll from inside to outside. I love it and my birds love it! The only reason we're giving it a three is because the end result is good but this was the worst thing to put together ever! THE WORST! Seemed a bit flimsy going together but it works fantastic for sugar gliders.  Much larger than their previous habitat and strong enough for them I love the space my birds have in this flight cage.  Lots of room to move toys around.  Easy to clean!  I would have two people to help put it together. This cage would be great for very small birds that like a lot of room, but it is not a good cage for larger birds. I have a Parret and he can bend the weak bars but climbing on top of the cage. The cage also has 6 spring loaded feeding doors. My bird was able to push them open because the springs are small and weak. The cage looks nice but isn't fit for large bird use. My birds and I love this cage! Easy to move from room to room (we follow the sun), easy to clean, lots of room, excellent quality. The cage was a little challenging to put together. It takes 4 hands to erect, took 30 mins. to complete.. Very sturdy and well worth the money. Instructions where not simple ", "This cage came quickly and was in great shape did not have any damaged parts or missing parts my husband said the trick was figuring out what went where but he figured it out and all 4 of my finches love this cage placing your own perches inside is no problem my husband made some from outside was a great price for this cage as well Awesome, best cafe ever, birds love it, room for toys and flying around. This cage is exactly what we needed for our two doves. The cage itself is a little flimsy and the last back piece was a pain in the neck to get in because you would get the pins in then move out of place on the other side. I battled with it for a good 15 minutes. All in all it\u2019s a great buy! This cage is nice because it has a lot of room but if I had to do it over I would have bought my green cheek conure one of the heavier wired cages that preview has to offer. I think this cage is better suited to finches or for parakeets. This is a very large cage and could house several birds. This was generally easy to build, and is the perfect size for my mynah to fly in. This cage was great for the price. You can't find a cage this size for $125. However, the quality of the cage isn't the greatest. The metal is weak and not all of the welds are strong. Some of the wire were bent and one wasn't even welded. The handle on the slide out cage on the bottom was bent unevenly so it looks crooked. The directions are just silly, but if you have any common sense it isn't difficult to put together. Despite the quality issue, it is a great cage for small birds like finches, but no bigger than a parakeet because a stronger beak will tare it apart. I like this cage and so does my baby. My parakeets love it but it was kinda tough to put together. Happy parakeets. Lots of room to play. I bought this for my mom's finches. I think it took us maybe 30 minutes to assemble. It was very easy and the instructions were clear for once. They absolutely love the space to fly in as there is a dozen of them. Its easy for my elderly mother to clean. ", "Horrible to put together. Missing the right piece to finish putting it together. Flimsy. Never finished putting the cage together I give this all 5\u2019s across the board!  Our little Finches are so happy with all the extra room.  The assembly was easy to understand and the strength of the cage is very sturdy and to be on rollers is awesome!!! A lot bigger than expected and only one part was dented on arrival, but it isn't noticeable. Extremely easy to put together and I did it by myself. My birds live the space in this cage! Lots of room for toys and food dishes! Size is right Finch flight cage.  3 pairs are very comfortable This is a beautiful cage! It only took about 20 minutes to put it together as long as you take your time and sort out the cage sides. My two budgies love their new space! Now for some new toys! Actually for the $$ I was VERY satisfied with the cage and the size! It'll hold up to 8 tiels VERY easy. The putting it together wil take 2 ppl. in certain places during the process, but well worth it. Only nay I have is the latches on the doors. not the easiest to get into and lock back up, and on 2 of the food dishes one of the clips that hold in onto the cage broke the 1st day, but besides that? The cage is huge and spacey and well work the $$. I wish I could write a book about this cage, but I'll try to leave out the fluff. This cage has pretty much everything I've been looking for in a bird cage. It's very well though out and must have been designed by a team that's had experience with birds. The slide out tray is deep enough for whatever you use to collect waste (I prefer pet wee-wee mats with Alpine bedding on top). But the birds can't make a mess in their waste because there's a grate, which is positioned above the collection tray. Plenty of room for the birdies to have fun, hop around and for all the stuff that comes with keeping birds. Nice, easy wipe finish, plus too many other features to list here. The only minor criticism is the latch on the main door--it's a bit odd imo. But there's not much that could take away from the 5 star rating of this cage. And let's not talk about affordability--this is a steal! It's easily worth in the $500 range, and I've seen that price in my parts. You will love this, and so will your birds! I bought this cage for my pair of budgies to give them lots of extra space to fly. It's a nice looking cage, and plenty of room for the two of them. It came with 4 large food/water dishes to hang in the cage which is great. It also came with 3 wooden perches. We had no issues assembling it, but we have owned similar cages in the past. ", "Really easy to put together. Very sturdy. My critter's love it. Plenty of room for gliding. Easy to clean and access critters. Having all supplies on the bottom shelf is very convenient. Being able to roll it out of the way for cleaning or relocation is great. Great cage It arrived broken but my husband put it in and put the birds in it so I did not return it.the part of plastic I do not like as it is completely because it does not fit well. Metal is not treated, after a few months you can see rust, one of the leg even broke off, Got the xtra large for my 3 parakeets they love the space to stretch their wings and fly pretty easy to set up with two people definitely recommend for the price. I'm very happy. This is a great bird cage for the money.  In fact, so much so that I got extra birds to fill it, and they are happy!  When I received the cage, it came without the necessary hardware to put it together.  I wrote the company and within a day I received everything I needed.  That's good customer service!  I would buy from this company again. Absolutely fantastic.  Tons of room for 2 sugar gliders and so many toys with even a lot of space to play in.  Put in together all by my self with the instructions provided easily.  No broken parts, even though the box it came in was worse for wear from shipping it.  Huge!  Love it!!! The cage itself was nice, but the tray that came with it was broken as you see in the picture. The tray is something that should be whole to maintain the cleanliness of the cage but with it being broken, it often falls out and doesn\u2019t serve its purpose. Very bummed about it. We have 7 parakeets and they all fit comfortably with plenty of room to fly around and do their thing. It's fairly sturdy, the tray is good heavy rubberized material and slides out easily for cleaning. I love that it's on wheels so I can move it around to clean under it. Would definitely recommend. Very large and beautiful cage. I received it today and am highly satisfied. Assembly took around an hour but the directions are very simple and straightforward. I am using it for my sun conure. The bars seem strong enough to to take anything that my bird can dish out. Everything arrived intact and in perfect condition. I look forward to purchasing more birdie supplies from Prevue. ", "I previously purchased 2 excellent breeder cages from this company, and so was confident about this purchase.  This cage is \"ok,\" but probably would not purchase another one.  Putting it together is tricky (have a helper if you can!).  The seed cups that came with don't fit the bars.  The slide-out tray fits onto the side rails - but barely.  On a positive note, it does clean easily (which makes me wonder what it is coated with).  It works as a holding cage for my fledglings, but I will probably shop around more thoroughly next time. To put the cage together you need two people kind of hard for one person otherwise it is a beautiful cage for small birds mine love it . Very nice cage I have 7 budgies in mine. The tray arrived broken but the manufacturer is sending a new one! Great cage for little birds. Easy to assemble. Nice roomy cage for my quaker and a green cheek conur.  Enough room for both to move around and even fly.  The wielding on this cage is weak, so you have to be careful putting it together not to break anything.  Also the bottom tray on my cage just falls off.  I just have the metal piece wrapped in plastic to repel the water and topped it with paper towel.  The feeding trays also don't sit easily on the bars so you have to apply a little pressure to make it sit tightly.  If you can adjust to these little nuisances than this cage is a good deal for the room offers your birds to move around in. This is NOT a cage for small birds like canaries, what a MISREADING description ;(( Purchased for my sugar gliders and it has perfect! Easy to clean but had a little trouble assembling. When I got this it was open Box in some of them was bent. Bab Store Love the cage for my two cockatiels.Very big and sturdy. No missing parts or damage at all. And it took me about half an hour to put together. ", "They recommend that two people assemble it.  Two people are definitely better than one when putting it together, but if there is only you and no helper, using TWIST TIES will do the trick.  Except for the back, each and every piece is unique, so lay them all out and look at them all until you understand where each piece goes.  Assembling it is then a piece of cake if you use twist ties to hold the pieces lightly together, before you tighten the bolts.  When assempled, this is a very sturdy cage and easy to keep clean. We initially purchased this cage for our parakeets, however after assembling it and seeing how big it actually was we put our  ringneck in it and he loves it. I bought this cage for my 2 quakers.  It is huge!  You have to put it together, the instructions are a little hard to follow, and you need a friend to help out, but you get the hang of it.  Nice finish.  It has 2 big doors and 4 small doors.  I took one of the small doors off for the nestbox, and it fit perfectly.  Love the wheels, makes moving the cage around so easy.  I love the cage! We wanted a cage that was big enough for our parakeets to fly around in, more space.  We had looked at other sizes, but we felt this was the one.  And it was!  Our birds are able to stretch their wings and flutter around inside.  It was easy to assembly, it came with instructions but none of the parts were stamped with any indicators..i.e. ,A,B, C. D.  etc. So I relied on the picture on the box to help me assemble it.  It is  sturdy and I like the casters, I can move them outside with ease.  I would recommend this product very highly. The cage itself is very beautiful. I have two main complaints.. Amazing value - love that it rolls for sweeping bird messes- perfect for my 7 parakeets I bought this cage to use for three pet rats that I was getting and it worked out great for them. The bars were spaced apart just the right amount for them not to be able to get through. This cage was also a lot bigger then I thought it was going to be which was also a plus. It is also very sturdy and I would order one again from this seller for sure. Need two people for assembly. Great cage. It's perfect! I have one Quaker and one cockatiel. They absolutely love this cage. It's a gift and a curse because now they would prefer to spend more time playing in and on their cage than hanging out with me. Haha. It makes me so happy and relieved to know that they enjoy the size of this cage because I work full time and take classes a couple nights a week, so some days they have to be in it a long time. There's so much room to reorganize toys and there is room in top of the cage to put a little play perch for when you're at home and have the cage opened. Seem like they could be better quality. Our small/medium sized bird, a cherry head conure, has broken bars on her door because they are too weak for her beak. The green cheeks can't bend and break the bars like her though. ", "Easy assembly, rolls easily, storage is convenient. Good cage, the only two objections I have is that there is no way to secure the side doors - a bird can push that open and fly out , which seems a bit odd to me. So now  I have  a ton of clothespins on the cage to prevent that.  The other thing is that the silver tone disappears where bird droppings fall on it.  Still, definitely worth the money spent on it. Very well made for a small bird flight cage. This is the best cage. It was easy to out together with the help of my son, the roof is a little tricky if you're short like me. My birds live it, and the quality is outstanding. I'll have this cage for years to come. This is really a great cage! Very well made and easy to assemble.  Has wheels to move it around, lots of doors for easy cleaning or rearranging. I have lovebirds in one and just bought a second one for parakeets! Plenty of space for them to fly around. Overall nice cage.  There was a panel that had a stripped out screw inner piece.  My husband could redrill and fix it but it would not be able to come apart again.  So I called amazon and they offered to replace the whole thing or refund $30 of the $104 i paid.  I figured with shipping and time since it was overall a minor problem we kept the cage and my husband fixed it.  It will not have a resale value in the future but I intend on keeping it so I am happy with the out come. Nothing is labeled, stickers with A B C, etc would be extremely helpful. This cage was really well packaged and easy to put together with two people. I left off a star because some of the pieces were bent and the casters required a hammer to make them flush. i have four of these. the newest model is nice, i like the improved front doors. a bit too small for my wife, but my dove fits perfectly. While most of the cage is very good, the legs are not very sturdy. Within weeks the legs buckled on one side so that it has to be shoved up against the wall. That made the tray not stay in place so we have to hold it with a large clip to keep the tray in. I'd look for a sturdier product. It\u2019s a great cage until you get some little bugs crawling in between the holes and once it becomes infested...it\u2019s difficult to get them out completely. Had this for a year but now we are getting rid of it because of this situation. ", "Plenty of room for multiple budgies and toys.  Well made and easy to move around to window or out of the way to clean under the cage.  Would buy again for sure. I love this cage. Me and my dad put this together today and I'm SO HAPPY with the result. It's not too big (I know that sounds like a bad thing) because it doesn't protrude too much into my room making me still be able to move. It's almost as big as me at 5'5 and can't wait to get my green cheek baby! I will update my review when I get my bird. (If I remember to) Cage is nice and good sized for sugar gliders but some parts arrived bent and dinged up.  Cage also rusts and is cheaply made.  There are better cages out there.  I would skip this one. I have had this cage a little over a year and would tell you to save your money!!! The cage has rusted and I now have to keep it together at the bottom of the cage with zip ties.As I move it it wobbles back and forth and the bottom of the cage falls out. The price has dropped by 20.00 form when I bought it and I still would tell you save your money!!Very poor quality!! This is the perfect home for my 1 oz parottlet.  Lots of room for lots of toys, exactly what a parott needs. Arrived very quickly. It took some time to assemble. Very roomy and sturdy. It's held up just fine since we purchased it. The parakeets seem to love it as they have more space.  Moderately priced too! Was pleasantly surprised by how nice the cage looks. Went together easily with the included tool. Huge. Inexpensive. Decent quality. Pretty. Can't beat this for the price. Easy to put together. Great product This cage should not be marketable. The wire is so weak any bird can get out of the side spring doors, main doors, and easily snap the bars or bend them and get stuck in them. ", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd17 Definitely needed a 2nd pair of hands to put this together but in the end, this cage was perfect for my 2 cockatiels. Very nice cage for multiple parakeets. Only thing is some of the parts are rough and need filed down to fit. (Like the lock.). Huge cage! Easy to put together. Used for our sugar gliders I had finches that were breeding so I wanted a roomier cage for them. This is so perfect. Now they all have plenty of room to fly around and have their own spaces. The color is much better than described as well. It has a silver fleck on it, so it looks very nice. The shelf on the bottom is perfect for storing food and extra dishes and bath supplies. Some hinges were missing on the doors. One of the 5 feeding cups was broken. Customer service did not respond. On a positive note, the bird loved the extra space.  It is as large as a 4-drawer upright dresser. Spacious enough for my bird to stretch his wings and  fly around. Easy to roll / move around. Has a lot of doors for easy access. Great cage, great price. It was easy to put together just make sure you follow the instructions. My boyfriend installed the doors backwards at first, but he didn't even glance at the instructions. The only thing I don't like is that the metal seems a little flimsy. This thing is awesome! I bought for my sugar gliders and they play sooooo much more! I assembled it myself pretty quickly. I'm about 5'1 and it's about the same height as me. One of the trays came cracked but I only needed 2 so not a big deal. It\u2019s a nice and sturdy cage. My birds love It. ", "Love this cage. amazing for the price. very big. its a mansion for my two green cheek conures. the side doors are very handy for hanging toys and perches in the back. they do not lock but havent had any escapes. you could always zip tie them or something though if you are nervous about that. GREAT DEAL. I received this cage today. Some of the sections were bowed. I got 3/4 the way putting it together and noticed a solder point is broken and a hole is too small the thread the screw through it. So now I still don't have a bigger cage for my Canaries. This has to be the absolutely worst bird cage I have ever bought!!! A piece of junk!!! Be careful about how you assemble the cage, because some of the instructions are rather confusing and I did indeed assemble it incorrectly the first time around. It's mostly an inconvenience if one misassembles because of all the screws, however, when I did assemble it correctly, it was quite wonderful and provided adequate room for twenty canaries (if not more if one is in need of space). Very sturdy. I bought 2 of these , I 100% recommend for sugar gliders , bar space is perfect , easily cleanable , and the doors on the front are perfect , don\u2019t let the picture fool you , I love these cages !! It looks so good in person Great cage This cage is huge.  I have 8 green cheek conures and 7 babies in a nest.  This cage is roomy for everyone.  There\u2019s no more fighting because they\u2019re on top of each other.  They have room to fly and play with their toys and have their personal space. Our Green Cheek Conure loves her new cage.  Plenty of space for toys and movement! DO NOT BUY THIS BIRD CAGE- OUR COCATEELS HEAD GOT CAUGHT IN SPRING LOADED SIDE DOOR, AND NEARLY KILLED HIM- LUCKY TO STILL HAVE OUR BIRD- BARELY SURVIVED- TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW!! Assembly wasn't too difficult.  It rolls very easily, it's easy to remove the bottom tray, and I really like all of the access doors!  I house two parakeets in here and it's plenty of space for them to fly. I was really happy with this cage for the price, but I paid around 85$ I will check my purchase but it was around eighty dollars even I wrote that like 4 months ago  it was the best choice for the price but now it\u2019s over 50$ more I wanted to buy another one but not any more. ", "The parts were clearly for specific levels and a couple glances at the adequate instruction sheet gave the rest of the needed information for quick assembly. Took my time and only had to ask my daughter once for her set of hands. Perfect home for my cockatiel. Plenty of room inside and on top for her to play and stretch out. I put it together by myself but would recommend an extra person to lend a hand if available. Good cage. Lots of doors and four food dishes. I had some problems mounting it up. Pay special attention to the holes on the various panels as it is easy to use the wrong parts or use the right part upside down. After a year, it has also started to rust, so remember it is not rust proof. So initially the bottom tray (catches the seeds and mess) arrived warped and cracked, I contacted Amazon in order to try to get a replacement part.  They said I would need to send the whole cage back.  I decided I would just live with it instead of going through the trouble of sending back such a large cage.  After getting fed up with the bottom being broken and falling out on occasion I decided to check the manufacturer.  I emailed them, they requested a receipt, and within two days I had a replacement tray.  This company has excellent customer service.  I will certainly be looking into their pet products for my future needs. I ordered this cage for my 2 quaker's. Very big and spacious, overall satisfied. My birds enjoy it. The cage is perfect if you are housing several birds. I definitely needed a skirt for the bottom of my cage, my birds fly a lot and does does all the other stuff along with it. Price, space and quality were my main concerns buying a flight cage. Shipping was very quick, I got it within 3 days. The directions were a little confusing at first, but I was able to put it together myself with ease. I would recommend having 2 people during assembly as it would be a lot easier, but if you have the patience you can do it yourself. It's a pretty well built cage, a few pieces were bent and the \"lock\" that holds the tray in the bottom was garbage. Somebody at the factory screwed it up and it just dangles there. Overall a good buy, for a decent sized cage. I don't see the big deal about this cage. The wire is flimsy and I don't like the gap around all of the panels. With a little effort a small bird could get his head stuck in one of them.  The size is good but that's about it. A couple of the panels aren't completely straight. At this price point there are better cages available.  I would not buy it again. The bottom catch  tray needs to have  widre  edges  as keeps slipping and falling  down /The food tray hooks on back of them  to hang in cage  to not  match the wire pattern  to attach  them  and cannot be attached.  as a cage  wire always  in way to hook them to cage. ", "This is my second one of these. I have budgies in one and diamond doves in the other.  They are great cages giving these birds space to fly.....so important for our little winged friends. I will probably buy one more in the future.  They are versatile with plenty of access to the interior and a \"good buy\" for cockatiels, budgies, doves, canaries and finches. Highly recommend. This cage is perfect for my two parakeets. They have plenty of flight space and places for toys. Great for canaries. I have 4 in one cage and they love the space to flutter around! Although it was a pain to put together, this is a huge cage that looks great.  It is a cockatiel mansion!  I was worried about the doors that don't lock, but they have springs and don't present an issue.  The only problem I had with it was that it arrived with a cracked tray, but other than that it's great. Easy to assemble and sturdy. We'll see how it stands the Florida elements outside in the patio, but so far so good. No signs of rust. The perches included fit perfectly Love it perfect size I read some bad reviews but decided to take a chance because of the price. This is a very nice and big cage! I have no complaints at all. Glad I purchased it. I keep my parakeets in it and they have so much room! Great price and cage. For the price, you really can't go wrong. I have 3 parakeets and they seem to love the extra play space. The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is that the doors on the sides don't have locks or latches. I ended up putting some bread ties on them. The directions say that you should have a partner to assemble it, but I did it alone in an hour. I bought this car for my two sugar gliders.  They were trapped in a small cage for a year before I rescued them.  They have a blast jumping all over the cage.  I had to ziptie the slide doors closed but I hope to purchase another one in the future and extend the cage.  Also easy clean up to take a large wheel in and out of the bottom. Needed to replace my sugar gliders cage and this is PERFECT.  Have it had it about a month now.  We did have to wire tie the doors where the bird food dishes would be which isnt a bad thing, just a thing. Cleaning is easy, the floor slides out as well as the tray for easy access/cleaning. Large enough the critters get to bounce n soar all over the place! ", "Thrilled !! with this cage. its, Huge!  & comes with  four long & well designed double feeding  Throuhs & 3x extra long & sturdy wooden perches,  On wheels , & can move around  with ease ,if needed .Easy to assemble with Good  Detailed  Instructions .  Delivery was Extremely Prompt .  A total bargain at this price.  Thanks Prevue!:) I bought this for my sugar gliders after doing A LOT of research. They love it. Plenty of room for them to play in. I tested all gaps in the cage and its glider safe. Wasn't hard to put together at all. I did most of it on my own till my roommate came home and with her help it got done in ten minutes. And the price was great. Most economical price for the quality I could find. This is a great value for the price. I have 4 lady gouldians in this cage and two nest boxes (plastic) in the openings. Had to get creative to make the nest boxes fit correctly but nothing that couldn't be easily fixed. A very nice, affordable cage. Assembles fairly quickly, though 2 people are needed. Solo assembly would be possible, but extra difficult. Plenty of room for small birds. Easy to clean. Excellent for price, large cage. Put together easily. On wheels which is a plus. Easy to clean slide out tray. Great deal for the price.  My birds (5 cockatiels) and I are very happy with it.  Well made.  For me, a nightmare to assemble.  Provided instructions were tolerable....physical items doe not have any label on them to match drawings.  Takes 8 sets of hands to assemble, or one fuming me.  But got it together, and am very happy with it. Love this cage. Its perfect for my 6 budgies. Lots of usable space. Only thing I'd change is it needs a bigger front door, but otherwise i love it! The cage is really nice.  However the instructions for assembling it could have been better...none of the pieces were marked, which would have been nice.  Overall very happy with this purchase Well built cage.  I put it together myself in about 1 1/2 hours.  Great size.  Would definitely recommend.  Only issue I had was one of the feed dishes was broken. Really big easy to put together when you get to the top can be done with one person but would be a lot easier with two ", "We call this our Conure's condo not his cage. he loves the size and all the different toys we got from Amazon that we put it in. My wife does switch out the toys every few weeks so he won't be bored and I did get some multi-colored braided rope at a local hardware store to put across the condo. Perfect for my Quaker Three years of owning this and it is still standing! Not as strong though. We have one weld that broke. It is not a devastating break but, it did happen. This cage is still a good budget friendly cae. Exactly what I was looking for my pet cockatiel. I love it! For the money this cage is a fantastic deal.  We keep 7 zebra finches in it and they have plenty of room.  I replaced the dowels that come with it with some real branches.  Not hard to put together... I did it myself except for top piece where it was easier with another pair of hands. I loved everything about this cage and how spacious it is!!! If you\u2019re looking for a cage and don\u2019t know if you should get this one you definitely should!!! It was easy to put together and the directions were very clear. This is my first customer review after using Amazon for years, and this cage drew me to write a comment. This is BY FAR the best deal I've found for cages.  If you want BIG at an affordable cost, this is the cage for you. Got this for our sugar glider baby\u2019s and we love it great size super sturdy! Easy to put together Great cage! Very big! Lots of room for my 2 sugar gliders:-) Very Satisfied! My parakeets love it! ", "I bought it because it describes it as for cockatiels ..... but the thickness of the cage is too thin for them ..... it would be great if they describe it for smaller birds. i have had this cage for about a month and a half. This cage come with everything that it said it would and all parts easy to build took about 40 minutes 6 very good small breeder box doors for easy access and two big doors in the front but the top door was messed up and is harder to open than the bottom one a large shelf for storage very big cage my parakeets love it i have four and there is tons of room to fly around and large food/water bowls big enough for three of them to fit and eat while the other one is eating somewhere else and the bowls r divided so i can use seed and veggies to eat excellent cage with one problem thanks for reading Very pleased with this cage.  Easy to assemble and really a nice size for my 2 cockatiels. Has many door openings and is sturdy and attractive. Nice size to allow my cockatiels to fly around and move from perch to perch. We hung this from the ceiling and left off the wheels- works for me!  Great price,too. Very sturdy especially if u have other animals not too bad to assemble and a lot cheaper than the pet store Very perfect size for my sugar gliders it\u2019s like a mansion to them. They have room to glide and jump around with no issues. I find they come out more often because they are able to. Great value for a cage this size. However the instructions are terrible. I am pretty handy and this took me nearly an hour. Now as other reviewers have said, the bottom sliders are welded upside down which took me a half hour to figure out. I will contact company about this. You can't slide in bottom tray and bottom grill for birds to walk on. The rails are reversed. Pretty bad manufacturing flaw. Will update review after I talk to company. This is absolutely awesome. I have 3 Diamond doves in it and they are extremely happy. They have more than enough flight room. They are no longer on the bottom of their cage. They are cooing constantly. This is a great product. Love it. This cage is the perfect size for my two sugar gliders lots of room...goes together easy...I am totally thrilled that I bought this one the price was awesome and definitely worth it My Quaker parrot does great in his new cage. It's easy to put together  and clean Love it for my sun conure!! Perfect big size,  lots of room for toys food and the parrot.  Our conure loves it!!! ", "Wonderful cage! Large, very well made! Looks great. Packaged securely so pieces were all in good shape! Great value and well built It's a nice size cage for a few finches.  It's easy to assemble.  I like it very much. Received the product damaged. Feeder trays are very cheap and were broken when arrived. The doors were not securable as it arrived and missing a latch. I am giving 2 stars because I was able to return to receive full refund. And the cage is actually a roomy, large cage. Cage came one day after it was ordered and one day quicker than expected.  The bird seems to love her space.  Came without damage though one of the plastic trays had damage.  So I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if I was being hyper critical. I'm very pleased with this cage.  I have 2 cockatiels in it.  They have plenty of room to move around.  Biggest plus was putting it together.  All the holes matched up.  I did not swear even once.  That must be a record. Looks nice. To bad item was shipped after the original delivery date and both the box and item were heavily damaged. 1 door is very bent and the bottom tray is broken. My two lovebirds love their new cage. My kids put it together since I just had cervical spine surgery. Plenty of room for them to fly around and act like the silly birds that they are. I wouldn't use this cage for larger birds as the bars can be bent easily, but possibly up to a quaker or conure would be appropriate, the bar spacing is small enough for even finches to live in this cage safely. I now own 2 of this cages. There perfect for birds like cockatiles and parakeets! Tje cage arrived without damage. In a brand new factory packaging was fairly esseybto assamble. Like some of the other buyers said this is a bit hard to put together but is a great cage. Lots of space there for 2 conures. ", "I did some research thru all the products available & found good reviews on this cage, so I decided to buy it. I really needed a bigger one (5 parakeets) but also needed something sturdy (2 cats!) I really had very little trouble assembling it myself, it took about an hour. I did not put the wheels on - was afraid any cats bashing at the birds would actully send the cage across the floor! It's easy to get inside to clean, feed & interact with the birds. Love this cage & reccommend it to everyone! Good sized cage which provides plenty of room for four cockatiels very easy to clean. I an considering to buy another for the other two cockatiels. Very easily assembled. I ordered this cage withthe intention of purchasing a quaker parrot to live in it. When it arrived I was impressed with its size!!! I could have several Quakers comfortably living in this cage and they would all have room to move around and play!! As other reviews state, the doors would need to be better secure for a smart bird like a quaker, however, they would be just fine for parakeets, canaries, or finches. Putting it together was very easy. A lot of the reviews said it was difficult and time consuming, but I'm an overweight woman in my 50s and I put the cage together in about 30 minutes with no help. The instructions aren't the best but common sense should kick in and fill in the gaps that the intructions leave out. A couple of the wire bars were bent but easily straightened with a pair of pliers. The cage is sturdy and looks great! I love that the bottom shelf and wheels are a part of the cage and NOT a seperate stand. I've found that when a large cage is sitting on a seperate stand it's open to be knocked over by grandchildren or large pets (especially Great Danes)  I loved this cage so much I bought a 2nd one and plan to breed Gouldian Finches. Couldn't be happier with the purchase!! We just have two zebra finches, I know this cage is overkill but it works great for them to get to exercise and move around. Excellent. I got the Large size and I have 6 regular sized budgies in it. I am looking to get an English budgie or 2 to also go in it but later on sturdy. lots of doors for easy access. Easy to put together,  lots of doors for easy access. We use this cage for our chameleon Rango :) This is exactly what I needed, was easy to put together and gives the parakeets much needed space to move around even with their toys hanging in it:) Great cage! My 3 rats love it, has so much room for them plus the bar spacing is perfect! Light cage it says you need 2 people to put it together i did it by myself but id be easyer with 2. No problems with bent wires and such. All around awesome deal for the price. I have had this for over 1 year. My birds love this cage. I am sure they feel like home. The extra extra room gives enough space to spread their wings. Rollers make the cage easy to move it while cleaning. The bottom rack is useful to store bird food and toys. I do Not recommend this cage for birds any larger/stronger than Cockatiels. ", "parfait pour mes 2 gris d'afrique quand je suis en vacances en floride This is a beautiful, sturdy cage.  It was 2 hours of pure hell to put together, but definitely worth it.  Now I just need to find some canaries to put in it!! My husband didn't think the large parakeet cage we had for our 2 parakeets was large enough. Well let me tell you this one is large enough for me to get in if the doors were bigger.  But, it's nice for the birds as they can get lots of exercise flying around the cage. Cage is a PITA to put together. Feeder trays broke in first week and don't fit properly between the cage bars. One of the bars was not welded properly so I can to solder it in place and then plati-dip the area. Many pieces arrived bent or warped.  I'm really disappointed.  I would not recommend purchasing this,  I  wish I  hadn't. What a lovely large size cage preferably fitted my 6 parakeets very easy put to gather I\u2019m so Happy comes before time Thank u Amazon \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Great buy for the price. I paid 98 dollars. Nothing was broken during shipping. Only advise is to not go crazy tightening the screws while assembling. Assembly Instructions could have been better though. Great cage, materials and size. None Great item. Baby Quaker loves it. It fits her well.

However, the second day I put her in it again so she can get used to the cage, she got too hyper and stuck her head through the bars. What happened was she started running around and playing with her toys. I stuck my finger between the bars to scratch her head and she stuck her whole head through the bars. She wasn't able to get her whole body through, but I had to force her head to go back in. It seems like a bigger budgie/parakeet variety would work better in the cage. Will have to stick to her old travel cage for now. It is a very good quality cage with easy set up, but make sure your bird is a bit larger than a budgie, or Quaker or conure size. The poo tray bellow came warped, hence the 4 stars, however it manages just fine. I had my doubts about this cage being retractable and all of that but I love it and so does my sun conure! It was bigger than expected which of course is good for longer trips or car rides. It was between this and the Suncast pet carrier. After watching reviews it was obvious that the Suncast was too small for a week long trip so I chose this and I'm glad I did. Always keep in mind that you don't want to keep swinging toys in any car ride because it could smack against your bird during turns etc The product is poorly packed with loose parts. What's new, huh ? I love this cage. It's sturdy and folds together like a dog kennel and collapses for easy storage. We needed something for our conure to be in so he can sit outside on nice sunny days. It's roomy and should be something he can comfortably spend the weekend in when we take road trips. Very happy with this cage.  My avian vet is almost an hour from my house, and I needed a better \"travel\" cage for my birds.  I'm very happy with this cage, and all of my birds, Amazons and Greys both, will fit comfortably in it.  It was easy to put together.  In fact, it took me longer to open the package than to put the cage together.  Not complaining.....it was wrapped very well, and of course, the cage was in perfect shape.  Also, it's nice and light, but sturdy.  I'm very happy I ordered it. ...NOT a permanent cage.  Even those with small birds (finches, canaries, etc) should be using a larger cage than this one for a main cage, I would hope.  This bar spacing would also not be appropriate for tiny birds. Much larger than I expected for the money. Cleans easily and looks great. Fits my eclectus parrot perfect. I purchased three of these so each of my cockatiels would have their own space for traveling in the car.  To my surprise all three birds with distinctively different personalities remained calm in the moving car and more peaceful than in other things we have tried. Two of the cages were simple for one person to set up, the third box had a cage that was jammed together that took some thought and effort to unfold. One of the cup rings was bent because of this which makes it more difficult to change the water,  The slip out waste tray is much nicer than any portable cockatiel home I have ever used.  The bowls are deep and have lock bubbles to prevent spillage in a moving vehicle when filled below the \"bubbles\" and the cages are secured in a upright position.  The only negative I see about this travel cage is that you have to open the one large door to refill the food and water during a long trip and a bird may escape and get lost if their wings aren't clipped.  I would like to see a lightweight travel cage where you could change the food and water without opening the main door.  The perches in my packages were nice and not too short. If the door doesn't stay locked to your satisfaction, all you have to do is use a recycled lock ring that comes on most cockatiel toys.  I chose this cage over the other choices because it came with things I know my birds like.  After a car ride of about an hour we returned home and sat the cages on the kitchen island with the doors open and left for another three hours.  When we returned home, all three birds were still in the travel cages.  None flew back to their permanent wrought iron 18X18X57 prevue hendryx cages.  Our birds will be happy campers now. I purchased this as a temporary cage for a conure that my husband rescued from a tree in our neighborhood until we found the owner. Well, this clever little guy was able to escape the lock and we had to get pretty creative to secure him in the cage.  My parakeets would not have been able to get out of this cage, but conures will let you know that you need to up your game if you want them to stay in  the cage.  We had to finally put a padlock on the cage to secure him. Overall, the cage is well-made, easy to assemble and easy to carry. I still recommend it as a travel means for your birds. ", "This turned out to be a nice cage for evacuating our African Grey parrot for Hurricane Dorian. There was one minor flaw, one of the white holders for the cups was welded crooked, which made using one of the enclosed bolts an impossible task. I had to rummage through our bolt supply to find one slightly smaller so it could fit past the crooked weld, and eventually it all worked out. This is the perfect travel cage for my green cheek conure. I use this when I go home to see the family for holidays (sometimes a week or so) and he seems to enjoy it. There\u2019s enough room for him to stretch his wings and add a few toys and a sleeping tent, so I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s too cramped in it when he has to spend several days in it (don\u2019t worry I still let him out for plenty of play time). The only thing I would change is adding small doors to access the food bowls, he either tries to come out every time I change his food, or thinks I\u2019m trying to make him come out when he doesn\u2019t want to- resulting in nipped fingers. It is a bit heavy, but I can still move it from room to room easily so he can be a part of the action too while everyone\u2019s bustling around. I love that it has a grate at the bottom so he isn\u2019t walking around in his mess getting his feet and tail feathers dirty, and I can easily pull out the bottom tray and clean it without disrupting him. For the purposes of travel it is excellent.  It would be nice if there was a way to have a perch on top of the cage.  However, it does the job.  I like the removable tray that is washable.  I can just hose it off and put it back into use after drying it.  I use this cage for travel with my Conure.  However, I also use it as a bedtime device for him as it is easier to cover and keep it dark for him.  The product is a great quality.  The latch on the door/gate, however, would be better if it was able to be locked into a closed position so the bird can't easily open it.  The gate latch just slides open/closed.  It could use a bend on the end of it to require the latch be rotated and slid to lock the gate open/closed. So the idea was to purchase a mobile cage so that I could haul my Conure around and position him in my daily life - where otherwise I would have left him behind. We have a green cheek conure and a cockatiel.  We travel frequently, and we almost always take our birds.  These are big enough that they are comfortable while we travel, and once we are at our destination, they like to get out and sit on the tops.  The trays slide out for easy cleaning, and they are the perfect width for lining with papertoweling.  The food and water cups have a little bump on the side that locks them into the holders at each side of the cage.  They are stainless and good quality.  The whole cage is sturdy, made well and has a handle on top for carrying. They come with a thick wood dowel for a perch, but  we've found that the birds prefer a rope perch, so we have a short one in each, along with a few toys to keep them busy. This is a perfect cage for my greencheek when we go out on the patio for some fresh air and relaxation. It'll also be great for vet trips because it's a long drive from where I live. The best part is that he likes it so I don't get eaten alive like I do when I put him in his smaller travel carrier. He happily goes right in! I think it would work well as a sleeping cage, but my little guy sleeps in his regular cage. This will be a perfect travel cage for my green cheek conure. In my opinion, it shouldn't be a home cage because I think that bigger is always better for a main cage. Every single part of me is impressed with this cage. Thank the gods for this cage, seriously. You would think after owning several cockatiels for years I would already own a travel cage, but no. Any vet visits were done in a small plastic container meant for small animals. Any birds that needed to be separated for a temporary time we had to erect a small cage that we kept in storage and took forever to rebuild and clean. I finally had enough and ordered this. It's a bit bigger than I expected, and more likely meant for a bigger bird (the perch that comes with the cage is rather big and my cockatiel never uses it so I stuck a swinging perch inside), but the food cups are sturdy and well made, and overall the cage is easy to assemble and collapse. We have yet to take the cage in the car with us, but I doubt that will be an issue. We currently have a recovering sick bird in here and he is much much happier being in here than the wonky set up we had before. The price is also great as i've seen some cages go for $100 or more. Shipping was also fast as we needed this cage asap! Thank you! Needed a travel cage for a vet visit for my African Grey. I was nervous about the dimensions and cage over all, but as soon as I put it together, I knew it would be okay. My guy had plenty of space for a day trip. I would say if you want to use this as a vacation travel cage, it would be fine as long as they were able to get out and stretch there wings. The only thing I didn't like was the handle, which I am making a replacement for. For birds smaller then a CAG, this cage is fine. For birds larger then and CAG, you will need to look for something larger. The wooden dowel has to rest on the bottom bar, for him to have enough head room. I also think it should come with two, since it is a longer cage (I ended up making him two from 3/4\" dowels. First the good; the wire spacing is just what I needed for my Pionus Parrot. This isn't awful but it is more like a dog cage shrunk down to bird size. The wire of the cage is easily bendable which becomes a problem after you attach the stronger metaled food dish rack. If you try to remove the dish, instead of the dish coming out of its bracket, the wire of the cage bends towards you. ", "This bird cage \"will do\" for now for short road trips between the house the bird lives at and the pet sitter.  However, the instructions to put this cage together were poor and I had to get them off the website because the instructions and parts were trapped in the folded cage and could not be reached until the cage was put together.  The cage might have been easy to put together except that 2 sides were stuck together in a way that they were not meant to go.  It took pliers to get them apart.  The door \"locking\" mechanism does not really lock.  A bounce could easily move the mechanism out of the lock.  I will have to tie them together. Excellent little travel cage. We have a 6 month pineapple green cheek conure that we recently took on his first road trip across several states and although he sat on either my husband or myself for the majority of the journey, this travel cage provided and excellent place to keep him safe while we dined out and overnight while he slept. He didn't have a single accident which I attribute to the accessibility of the cage in the backseat and the fact our bird is freaking rad. We had brought along a 14 in comfy perch for him to sleep on and he much preferred sitting on that as opposed to the provided perch at night. I saw other reviews stating that the bar spacing was too wide to safely leave a green cheek in, and although it is wider than what is suggested for a green cheek conure, I would've been amazed if our bird found any motivation to push his head through the bars. On the way home you could tell that he was getting a little worn down from all the going's on over the past few days and he happily spent the last few hours of our journey shredding some paper toys at the bottom of his cage, while it was half covered up. Definitely a solid little cage and the ease at which it folds up and stores is a huge plus. I would certainly repurchase should the need arise. I love this cage, it's perfect for our birds.  We can comfortably fit our tiels for road trips.  The cage is very sturdy, and the tray has a piece that clicks closed so the tray won't slide out.  The perch it comes with fits very securely, and other perches easily attach.  The only issue though is we can only use one of the bowls.  The bowl holders have screws and wingnuts, however on one of the bowl holders, the hole for the screw is too high and the head of the screw won't fit in, which is really disappointing. I've reached out to the company, so hopefully they'll be able to replace it, I really don't want to have to return the whole thing! I use this case as a car cage for my small conures, but it does have its drawbacks. First off, the bar spacing on this cage is a little odd. It's too wide for most really small birds, yet the cage is too short for most birds with larger heads. My sun conure has a big head, so I wouldn't feel weird about leaving her unattended for a little while in this cage. I would never leave my green cheek in it alone, though, as she could stick her head through the bars and get hurt. Perfect short distance travel carrier for my Congo African Grey (CAG) parrot!  My CAG prefers to travel on bottom of cage rather than simply perch and I like the fact that this has the bar bottom with easy pull out tray to keep him clean. Still has enough room to perch if he wants to though.  And it's nice this came with two removable feeding bowls that can be placed anywhere. Ignore the lower ratings, here, unless you, too, are mechinically challenged. This cage snaps together in a minute, no biggie. Those who talk about bars being painted together (I strongly suspect) are trying to open parts that are not meant to be opened. Also, the food and water bowl mounts must be lined up before you tighten the screws, or you'll think the screw holes are off center. The bars are for cockatiel or larger birds, and I believe the description points that out. No, your parakeet will not be a good fit for this cage and vice versa, literally. This is our go to travel cage. RECOMMENDED. I have an atypical need for this cage. I live on a farm, and most years I end up with nestlings or fledgelings that I either help out or they become cat or dog food.  I've successfully helped a lot of wild birds go on with their wild little lives, and really needed a cage that wouldn't take up tons of room the rest of the year. I was so happy to find this, which is a small version of my dog crates. It has everything needed, and unlike the last one I used won't be worthless if the bottom tray breaks. I didn't realize perch and bowls were included plus hardware, that was a nice surprise. I have 3 conures and a hahn's macaw.  This was my second purchase of the Prevue Travel Cage.  I understand that the product folds up nicely but that is not what attracted me to it.  I bought my second one because it is absolutely fabulous for traveling.  I am a Florida snowbird so I travel twice a year with my parrots in the back seat of my car. These cages allow them to be comfortable for 2-3 days at a time.  They can see out of all sides and have room to move around.  Most travel cages made me feel sorry for my bird being cramped up and unable to see the world going by. I was also very pleased at the cost for such wonderful quality. I bought this for my African Grey parrot for traveling and for when I clean her bigger cage at home. She loves it! You may need to purchase a few more perches to put in it, but it is a wonderful cage for large birds. Even medium birds such as parakeets would do well and not be able to get through the spaces of the bars. It is very strong, durable, and long-lasting. I highly recommend it to anyone with a medium or large bird that must travel with them. It is even good for birds that do not like large cages. There is plenty of room for toys and several perches. It comes with two strong bowls for food and water that fit in metal supports that lock the bowls in place. Terrific product! This cage is a great  size for my Meyers parrot. I am very happy to have found it. It's sturdy, folds nicely and seems to be good quality overall. The one I received was missing a part. I called the manufacturer's customer service and they mailed the part in a couple of days. I would recommend this cage.  The plastic packaging for the small parts could definitely use some improvement. ", "This cage has been a great addition for allowing my sun conure to travel around the city or just to hang around outside. He has a very large cage that is not easily mobile. This small cage is spacious, simple and very convenient. The price makes it a super buy! My sun conure and I liked it so well that I purchased a second one for our other conure. Quick and easy set up! The quality of the cage is nice too! I always prefer stainless steel bowls for their food and water and this certainly did not disappoint. This cage is such a great purchase. My dad bought this a few years back for when I need to take his Sengal parrot to care for when he's away. It fits perfectly in my passenger-side (buckled in!) when I have the large cage broken down for transport. The door is very simple to use and thus far has been escape-proof! This is very easy to \"knock down\" to the storage size and is intuitive to figure out. I know the original cage came with a perch, but my more recent purchase also included two feeding dishes. These dishes are well designed in that the rings that adhere to the cage have two places on either side where the ring juts out a bit; these correspond to two little bumps in the sides of the bowls. Thus, when you drop the bowl in and twist, this deters any little birds from picking up the bowl and throwing it (as a certain senegal loves to do....). I liked the design enough that I bought a second one for my two indian ringnecks for any transport needs that they might have. Admittedly, it's a bit tighter with two of them, especially with their tails, but for short-term use, this is a great cage! We purchased the cage because we wanted to use it while traveling and then be able to store it away when not in use. And to be fair, the \u2018cage\u2019 part is easy to put up and take down, and it\u2019s the correct size for my cockatiel. However the cups are the issue. ABSOLUTE JUNK. NONE OF THE PARTS FIT. THE DRINK HOLDERS WERE ALL WELDED CROOKED. THEY SENT COUNTERSINK SCREWS WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING COUNTERSUNK. WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.  WHEN I READ MADE IN CHINA, I'M ALWAYS LEARY ON THE QUALITY, BUT THIS WAS OVER THE TOP ON POOR QUALITY. THE FLAT PIECE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HOLD THE CUP WAS TOO SHORT TO WORK. NOTHING WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT. The advertising could have been clearer about the wire spacing.  I notice that since I sent this cage back the ad is much more clear now that the bar spacing is too far apart for smaller birds.  Good for us, the intrepid Amazon reviewers, for again demanding - AND getting - clear, informative ads that properly represent the product. We're in the middle of a someone complicated move, where we started with a 1,000 interstate drive, and movers won't get most of our stuff to us for about a month with the giant birdcage we normally have. Although Prevue Pet Products Travel Cage comes with easy-to-follow steps to assemble instructions with graphic pictures, this cage is one of the simplest to put together. In the box, the cage is already attached. Just lift the top--the top and bottom are already attached to two sides, and then hook the remaining two sides. That's it. Once I figured out how to put it together it turned out super. Very sturdy for sure. Directions were rather sketchy but common sense prevailed.The hard part was figuring how to get the tray out with the dishes and perch setting in the tray. Just look at the very end of the cage and pull down on the curved handles at each end and it drops down so that the tray can then be removed. Now remember the dishes and perch are a bit hard to slide out on the tray but a little umph and success. The dish holder is extremely secure and easy to attach to the wires. The stainless steel dishes are very well constructed. Each dish has a marked indentation to set the dish on and it drops and turns to securely lock in place. Thus your bird can not flip each dish.( a terrific design indeed) I am amazed how well built this cage is. Now it is somewhat heavy to carry but what the heck. It is definitely worth this feature. I am getting one each for my Cockatiel Senegal and GCC. They need such a cage as they will be visiting my friend(their aunt as I named her) for 2 weeks. Their home cages are the 5 and 6 foot styles. I hope you like my comments. I have a Quaker parrot (monk parakeet) and a small car and this is a perfect little cage to travel with. It\u2019s very sturdy. Love this travel cage! I was in need of a new travel cage for my youngest green cheek conure, and did a lot of research before buying this one. I am extremely happy with the quality of this cage! Set up took mere seconds, very easy! I have dealt with flimsy and poor quality cages before, and this one is leaps and bounds better than those. Lots of room for my guy. Also the cup holders and perch can be put pretty much anywhere in the cage. Highly recommend and I am going to get one for my other conure as well, I like this one more than the clear plexi one he has. ", "This is the best collapsible, travel cage. I purchased it to move my parakeets. It is just large enough for them to be very comfortable yet easy to carry and move. All mechanical design details were engineered in: the dishes lock in, the hinges work well, the tray is easy to clean, locks together when folded and it comes with perches, too. The color is a nice bright white and the metal coating is excellent for easy cleaning. This cage is a perfect carrier for my two conures(a sun and a jenday). It has plenty of space for both of them. It's super easy to pop together and fold down to store it while not in use. The 2 food cups can be place just about anywhere which is great. The bottom is nice and deep to accomodate for bedding material as well. I put a soft perch in to give them some more space to stand but the wood perch included would work fine as well. I recommend wrapping it in vet wrap if you plan to keep it in. That helps the bird grip it a bit easier. We got this travel cage as a home for our son's budgie while away on a week-long vacation when we didn't have a good pet-sitting option. We didn't use it as a carrier during travel, but just set it up in a family house at the Jersey Shore. The carrier was easy to assemble, has nice food and water bowls, and a great door. Clean-up was comparable to the bird's regular cage at home. The cage folds up nicely into a flat rectangle that fits nicely in a car trunk. Our only complaint is that the cage is really sized for smaller birds like our budgie, but the wooden perch is way too big in diameter for smaller bird feet. We're going to remedy that for the future by purchasing a narrower perch that can be cut to fit the travel cage. Well made, seems like good quality. Our cockatiel didnt hesitate to go in. I do think the cups are too large for the size of the cage and the ring that holds the cup was not welded to the breacket in the center, so getting the screw into the hole was a bit of a pain, i had to knock it it. Thats why I took a star off. I might look for smaller cups if I can. We plan to use this as a cage when we need to take him for grooming or to stay with us overnight when staying over at friends or family. Great quality & size for the price. The dog kennel style folding is a nice feature for storage. My only complaint is the door latch. There is no means of securing the latch in the closed position and it slides open very easily. Green Cheek Conures are very intelligent birds and can figure out how to unlatch this door from the inside. I bought this for my green cheeked conure to take to Florida for a week vacation. It\u2019s perfect. I did zip tie the walls together just to make sure it stayed sturdy and opened, and the door has a REALLY crappy latch on it that can fall right open and that a smart parrot will figure out in 5 minutes , so I twist tie that closed to make sure it stays shut. Otherwise, pops right open, it\u2019s a great size, and my little bird has plenty of room. Great price point too compared to some other travel cages! This is a nice travel cage but the carry handle needs to be  beefed up.  The handle does not feel as if it is strong enough for the cage.  Also, the perch does not stay in place very well.  I have to put a different perch in when using the cage.  All in all it is a pretty good cage for short trips like to the vet or to visit grandma.  Love the large door it is easy to get your bird into. Folds down to a nice size for storage. I got this as a temporary/travel cage for 2 juvenile starlings to keep them out of trouble until their flight cage arrived. The white is beautiful. The wire grate on bottom can't be removed BUT you can pop one end out to fit the tray inside the cage. It collapses just like a dog kennel which is great for storage. It is way to small for any bird to live in full time. It comes with 2 bowls This cage is wonderful!!!  I recently had to move from state to state and needed a good way to transport my cockatiel. I needed something large enough to house him in for a few weeks till our things arrived from the movers, but small enough to transport in the car easily. This fit the bill perfectly! It was easy to assemble. Everything was great quality. I was able to put my cockatiel in there easily and he was very comfortable in it right away. It was easy to clean with a slide out bottom tray. It was even big enough to hang some of his favorite toys and his cuttle bone.  He spent a few weeks in it with no problems until his regular cage arrived. And best of all, the price was fantastic! One of my best purchases on Amazon! I purchased this as an extra or travel cage for budgies.  I will no longer use it for extended hours or w/out supervision. I witnessed one of my budgies sticking his entire head through the cage. Spacing of the bars may be ok for larger birds. This should still never be used for more than travel. Even if you are on a long weekend with your birds, you must bring extra support to keep the top from caving in. Especially since birds are very smart & can figure out a way to unhinge it if they want to get out. I would only use this if I needed to confine birds as you clean their permanent home. ", "So happy with this purchase! I got this for my green cheek conure as a travel cage and also to be able to take him outside on nice days. He's flighted and we have hawks that live in our yard so I now don't have to worry about him taking off on me.  It's a great size, folds up just like a wire dog kennel and locks together so it won't come open when you store it. Very pleased. Cage is larger than I anticipated. My son needed a new travel cage for his bird, but it too big for his car seats, but it is a great cage for the bird when they come over to visit. Large enough for her to perch & have toys instead of being stuck in a little travel cage. Excellent price for the size and quality of cage, only issue is with the feeding cups, they really are a bit too big for the cage, too deep for small birds. Looking for a travel cage for my Congo African Grey. This is a great value. She is unable to break through the cage, it comes with a water and food dish, a removeable plastic tray to catch any jetsam she may create, it's foldable for storage including the bowls and perch. I added another perch which she prefers to the one they provided as it is a little small and unstable for her. Seems to be sturdy, well designed and is light weight enough to carry easily. Fit on my passenger seat perfectly and she get belted in. I needed small, portable cages for my Senegal parrot and my Quaker parrot while our house was on the market. These cages made it very easy to carry the birds to a neighbor's house or out to our backyard every time there was an open house or private showing. They also worked very well as travel cages when we moved by car to our new house six hours away. The birds were very comfortable and arrived safe and sound. Easy assembly and great customer service. One part (the bracket for a food dish) was broken on delivery. The replacement part was sent to me by overnight delivery at no charge. Happy to recommend this good-quality cage. I wanted a sturdy but lightweight travel cage for my sun conure.  This arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for.  It's a good size for a travel cage and will be perfect for Koki when we travel!  I also purchased a tabletop perch from another company that hasn't come in yet.  Koki doesn't stay in his cages much, mostly uses them just for sleeping so this is perfect for our needs. The food and water bowls are notched so that you can turn them once inserting them into the holders to keep the birds from knocking them out, which is a great feature.  The only problem I've found with this cage so far is that one of the bowl's notches are not placed properly so they do not line up with the holders. I plan to call the manufacturer to see if they will send me a new bowl.  Other than that, this was perfect for our needs.  It's easy to put together and folds down pretty compactly.  For the price, I think it's a good deal.  I'm VERY happy with the purchase! Overall it\u2019s a nice cage. Perfect size for travel with my Caique in it or for work/other house visits. I like that it came with bowls, that was nice. It was also my second time buying it. Only reason my rating is lower is because I felt like it wasn\u2019t done being assembled due to how unstable and wobbly it feels even when everything is put together properly. I get really nervous already... I bought this travel cage for our 2 tiels to take them for grooming and vet trips. Could also be used for some outside time with supervision.  Has no issues assembling this cage but did have issues with wingnuts. Contacted the seller and they sent me replacements right away free of charge. Great everything for this one! I ordered this cage for a new baby cockateil. I was amazed how big it is. My new little bird loves this cage. It is built sturdy, and the stainless steel bowls are big. I am using this cage as a regular cage. My bird won't go to any others I have. I also can use it as a travel cute if needed. You can't go wrong with it These are great travel carriers. Picked up 5 of these for our two African greys, lovebird, Aztec conure, and Indian Ringneck. Came in handy when we had to evacuate for a hurricane. Will say the male African grey was not too keen on the size but the other birds did well for a 5 day stay. They fold down quickly for storage. Pretty sturdy and compact when folded. I tried to find a small cage that would suit my sun conure and this was perfect size for him! The only problem my bird had was with the bowls because they were a bit too big but he got used to it and he enjoyed staying in it without any problems. It has plenty of room for a small or medium sized bird, but a large one would probably be a bit cramped. Either way, the mess tray on the bottom is also a life saver and the box that this whole thing comes with is a fair size for a travel cage of the sort. ", "This travel bird cage is AMAZING! I\u2019m upset I spent so long looking for one when I shoulda got this from the start ! My Indian ringneck and conure fit in here just fine even when I want to take them to the vet together.  So happy with it ! And when they can\u2019t stand each other I can have one stay the night in here and all. It\u2019s very spacious for a travel cage and even room for toys !  And another plus : it\u2019s the easiest cage I\u2019ve ever put together!  Could not have been easier !  I love it ! This cage is suppose to be a travel cage.  I find it a bit heavy for that purpose.  The perch that came with it was wobbly.  A bird needs something to hang unto without it moving if the cage is being moved around.  It does have an easily movable tray for easy clean up. My GCC has plenty of room in this cage when I take him to the vet or when I travel to see family. It's easy to clean and its collapsibility makes it easy to store. Putting it together was easy as cake, didn't even need the instructions. if you know basic product design and or origami you should have no problem putting this cage together. I've had this cage for a while now and I use it a lot. It's great for travel because it's easy to fold down and set up. I also use it in different parts of the house when I want to have my bird in the room with me and I need him in a cage. I have a much bigger cage in my living room but of course I don't want to move it from room to room because of the size. The size is perfect for my conure but it's definitely not for a bigger bird. There are a few problems with this cage. The cage door gaps open a lot at the bottom. My bird can't get out but it really looks like he could if he was willing to try to squeeze through. Also the perch and dishes are very oversized for this small cage. The cage can only fit a smaller bird but the perch and dishes are big enough for a bigger bird so they just take up unnecessary space. I bought this cage for my sun conure. It pops up and snaps together very easily. If you plan to have this for more than a vet trip, I recommend getting some nickle-plated clips at the top two edges and on the door to keep smart birds in. You can get those at Lowe's for less than $3 each. I got this as a travel cage for my two green cheek conures. I also use it as a station for their food and water during the day as they are free range. This cage is awesome! It's high quality and large for small parrots but with proper bar spacing. It has stood the test of time, and is still good as new. It also folds for storage but I don't fold it down. I can see how that would be convenient for someone else, \u200bthough. I can easily put my birds in this cage in the event of an emergency or simply to take them to the vet. I have also used it for them to get some time outside. This cage is definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone with a smaller or medium sized parrot. Got this cage for traveling and tag a long to many activities daily. Highly recommend I bought two of these and out of the 4 cup holders only one had one hole that was useable. All of the others were off center so the screw would not go in. I\u2019m sending back one and keeping one with the one cup because I like the rest of the travel cage. Poor Workman Perfect travel cage for my Green Cheek Conure. He has lots of room to move around. It is even big enough that I could add one of his regular perches inside the cage. I added newspaper on top of the bottom bars, rather than have him poop into the tray below. Not just for birds!  Bought this for traveling with a large rodent.  It's the only chew proof containment with smaller bar spacing that I could find at a somewhat reasonable price (still a little too expensive for me).  Made my own waterproof padded liner for it and can use bottom tray for spare liner and treats for critter.  Worked out perfect and she was comfortable in it for a weekend get away.  Have purchased a second one and if I need more, I'll be back again.  Very sturdy.  Love it! ", "I wanted this cage to transport my cockatiel to the vet and back. It's just too big and heavy for that. Would be a good, sturdy, roomy cage for an extended car trip, but not the compact and easy to carry cage I was after. It really is a substantial cage though, and is easy to assemble. Sadly, had to send it back...and had to accept that the return postage was to be subtracted from my refund -- NOT what I'm used to with my PRIME membership!!! A great travel cage for my little green cheek! We used it as temporary housing while we were moving house, and it comfortably fit her huddle hut, two perches, a small bowl + the bowls the cage came with, and two hanging toys (plus some foot toys scattered on the floor). Overall, a great product for the price. I really like this cage! It\u2019s a nice size for my cockatiel and it has enough room for his tail (big plus). I use it to take him on longer trips. It\u2019s great for camping and road trips because it is collapsible and light weight. The bowls are nice and easy to clean. The bottom tray is very convenient and easy to clean. My parrot travels with me when I rv. She rides in the backseat of the truck in her cage. This cage was what I expected but I missed the smaller size dimensions when I ordered it and it was a little too small for her so I had to return it and order the slightly larger one. I had to replace my birdie's travel (car) cage when age & wear/tear got 2 his other one (loose wrungs needing 2 b re-soldered on). I couldn't believe the price of this one which is great! I recommend this cage 4 no bigger than conure-sized birds, it's too small 4 say, an African Grey, which u could get a grey in here but u have 2 put the perch almost on the floor. Got this cage for my Green cheek and looks just perfect for her. Pretty sturdy and compact enough for veterinarian trips or any travel.When not in use is easy to just fold it back and store it away But was missing a part for one of the bowls. The white metal part for the outside food cup holder. Got one extra screw and a wing nut. Over all a good buy. This was purchased as a travel carrier for a CAG.  The dimensions are fine, with adequate room for medium parrots to turn and move.  Unfortunately mine arrived both missing hardware and with wires painted shut.  The front door of the cage is literally painted shut.  I was also missing the hardware required to mount the food/water dishes to the side of the cage. It\u2019s great to use as a small cage for our Green Cheek Conure to sleep in. However, it\u2019s not good for travel. The latch easily opens with the smallest movement and my bird can easily open it. So definitely get some extra clips to keep the thing closed. This cage is the perfect size for a cockatiel. It was easy to put together and will be easy to clean. It is sturdy and my grandson is very happy with it. I would order from this person again. This is much better than I was expecting. Very well made and sturdy. I really like That it folds back down out of the way. I bought it as a travel cage for my cockatile. It\u2019s a little big for him but gives him lots of room to move around. This will for sure fit a much bigger bird. Anyway I highly recommend this cage you will not be disappointed. ", "It is absolutely perfect for what I need. I love that it its white and unfolds so easily. Came with perch, dishes and just the right size to transport my African gray when I need to. I wouldn't use it as an every day cage for her, but perfect to travel. Can't beat the quality for this price. I use this for my Eclectus when he stays at my parents' house when we go on vacation. Got this for traveling, it worked good for my two cocktails. Wish it was more sturdy. I put a snuggle tent in this and it works well for my connure I travel alot and use this for Nemi- it is roomie enough to use as her cage when I get to my destination and while we are in the car. She likes to see out the window and sing and dance to the radio. It folds to a manageable size but I have not had to pack it but it could be packed and carried  easily if for some reason you carried your bird in another carrier. I could see in some circumstances the bird would be protected better (from wind - other animals maybe or if it is scared to travel) in a regid sided more solid cat carrier. I like to see my bird and feed it treats while I drive - she keeps me company. This is a very nice travel cage for my conure. It's easy to assemble and roomy enough to not make the bird feel cramped. It comes with two stainless steel feeding cups which fit into the two holders. It's large so I put it on the back seat and wrap the seat belt around it. We hate leaving our blue headed pious at home, and HE hated his travel cage. When we gave this one a try, we were all happy! The food and water dishes lock tightly in place,perfect for car rides! This cage is even collapsible, which is great for storage and saving space! Great second home for my bird keep it at friend's house folds easy and compact the only little negative I wish I had a spot to put his food and water cup when it's folded Perfect for a temporary cage.  Bought it for a sun conure to stay in during a hurricane evacuation.  I put a playpen on top so he could come out and stretch.  Cage collapses and is easy to store under the bed. Worked perfectly for what we needed. Used in a hotel room and new apartment before our regular cages were put together. Very easy to assemble (takes less than a minute without the food bowls, 2 mins with the food bowls) and super light weight. Great investment. Wish is came with a carry bag. Great cage, very sturdy and sensible design. Nicer than I expected for the price. The one downside is that the bars are a bit far apart. If they were spread any wider my caique might be able to get his head stuck in them. I would not recommend for any bird smaller than a caique. ", "This is a lot bigger than it looks. It's about the size of a regular parakeet/cockatiel cage. Bought this as a travel Cockatiel carrier and cage for a long weekend trip.  So far it works wonderfully and I love the way it collapses down like a dog crate since I will be transporting some of those as well for this trip.  Hopefully this works as well as I think it will.  Update to come after use. This cage is just the right size for my Indian ringneck and for my greencheck conure.The only complaint is the feeder dishes.I tried to put the screw thru and i got stuck so I had to break the ring to get it out.I also dont like how you cant change the dishes from the outside of the cages I will be getting the bird dishes that you screw on the outside of the cages to use instead.But I feel this cage will suit the purpose I bought it for. Our green cheek conure was right at home on our seven week vacation.  Sturdy construction.  Easy to breakdown and fold flat.  Included S/S feed and water bowls.  Large door opening.  Electrostatcally painted for a tough finish.  A good buy. A good, sturdy cage! It's a bit heavy to carry, but not unreasonable. The bottom part slides out easily and makes quick cleanup quite simple. Note that the bar spacing is a little bit too wide for small bids such as, in my case, lineolated parakeets; while the bars are just about fine, the door does open a bit wider when moved around so I'd recommend securing it somehow just to be safe. Just the right size travel cage for my Quaker Parrot. You can place the feed and water dishes anywhere in the cage so it's easier to get to for the bird or you. I don't regret buying this cage and will buy more for my other birds as needed. This is the perfect travel cage for our cockatiel! We will be using it in our RV on the weekends. It's definitely not big enough for a forever home for cockatiel sized bird but will work well for a day or two at a time. This cage is also very sturdy and easy to put together. This is my Lovebird's sleep/travel/outside enrichment cage. I really love this cage and I've found that since he has a flight cage and this, he's less territorial. He's also very familiar with this cage and that it moves around, so in an emergency situation it would be very easy to pack him up and head to safety. So incredibly useful for transporting my Senegal Parrot. This is my second one, the first one I bought 10 years ago and gave it away, but re-bought this one. It lasts! I was so surprised when I opened the box.  This cage goes together and folds back up just like my dog crates.  That means, not only do I know how to do it, but . . .I can store it flat and get it ready to use in minutes.  Good quality.  This is our travel cage so it is perfect. ", "The cage is perfect for vet visits and daily walks in the sunshine. The quality of materials and build are excellent.  If you\u2019re looking for a small very well-made cage, this is the one to buy! Our Jenday Conure Parrot, Rio loves this cage, she knows it\u2019s outside walk time. Kind of small even if it's for travel. Inconvenient as to the opening for the gate. The small containers should be fixed in a metal circle in order to be attached. One of mine was too small, so it didn't fit the container and as such, the container was put on the floor. Got this for my parakeets, as a 2nd cage/ travel cage. The design is awesome! is a great well built cage, for parrot or large bird, mainly like a carrier cage, rather then a permanent home cage.  will last forever, but wasn't what I thought, but not because of seller, just me not reading everything clearly.  Nice cage thou, heavy duty, no parrot is going to brake anything, or do damages to this cage.  easy to clean. etc. This cage is well made, sturdy and easy to assemble.  I wanted it so that I could take my pionus parrot with me out on the deck in the evening.  He loves it, and he knows it means he gets supper out there.  It is a huge success! This is a great little cage. While too small to be the full-time cage for my bird, I use it for transportation or short weekend trips. it is easy to assemble/ disassemble. It is well-made and sturdy. Just put the cage together and placed my green cheek Oliver inside. The size is great for smaller Parrots. Plan to use it for enjoying the summer outside with my bird. The cage was very easy to put together though it's a bit on the heavier size so I probably won't walk around holding it. Very happy with this purchase! We have been toting a huge dog crate around for our parrot to be trimmed and clipped when we make the hour trip to purchase his seed. Big and bulky was what we had to tote him in because it doubles as a cage for our patio on lovely warm days for him to be outdoors yaking up a storm lol. We love this unit it folds that is the number one choice to have bought it, its roomy for this Amazon yet not big or bulky. He goes right in with out a problem. One of the best value/finds to date for exactly what we needed We bought two of these Prevue Pet products to use when we drove to Montana. One was for a Quaker parrot (Conure) and the other was to hold two cockatiels. These cages are well-built for being collapsable and we had no issues whatsoever. They didn't take up as much room in the car and we were also able to stack them. The birds actually loved them. They are easy to clean, come with two stainless bowls and the perch. For the money these cages are exceptional and we couldn't be more pleased. I wouldn't recommend using birds any larger than what we have. Our birds were the perfect size for these cages. Good to know, this is only for a large bird!!!  To big for a canary or parakeet.  They could easily get out! ", "The cage is huge. It can probably fit a small dog in it. I\u2019ve used it once for my cockatiel and he had plenty of room. He didn\u2019t seem to like the cage much so I had him out on my shoulder for the car ride. It is a good travel cage with food bowls and a perch. It is large enough for bigger birds or multiple small birds. This cage will keep your pet bird safe and secure when you need to transport it for any reason.  It is easy to set up and will just as easily break down flat for storage.  The cage is sturdy and easy to clean and your bird will be safe when housed in it..  It comes with a perch and two stainless steel cups and a grid.  I have used it for a lovebird but a cockatiel would be comfortable. Bought two of these for a pair of Green Cheek Conjures. Prevue does offer this cage in a heavier gauge, we bought one for a Sun Conure earlier. They run $50 - $60 I purchased two of these for my birds (a blue quaker and a hahns mini-macaw) thinking they'd be great for our upcoming cross-country move, and expected the birds would have to be in them for just  the 5 day drive.  Little did I know the 5 days turned into a month, due to a delay on the part of the moving company delivering my furniture & their large cages.  My birds survived nicely due to the wonderful construction and design of these cages and I highly recommend them.  They are durable, well designed and easily assembled and disassembled. My parakeet went through the wires within 30 minutes of being in this cage. Returned it immediately! This cage is for a medium size bird.  Quaker, Conure, etc. Its huge. Purchased this for travel and its a great size for my bird. Granted it is not as nice as the real cage at home but it does well. Los bowls de metal se oxidan rapido. Tuve que ponerle otros. Muy pesada, robusta. None I bought this cage so I could take my Cockatiel outside for a while. It's perfect for that. So I moved from Maryland to California and took my 3 cockatiels in this. Then Los Angeles wasn't working out. So I moved from California to Georgia and got to Atlanta with the birds in this cage. Great cage, would recommend it to anyone traveling. ", "Great cage! It arrived quickly and is very sturdy and easy to assemble and clean. I really like the stainless steel bowls for food and water. Good price as well. I'm very happy with this purchase. Perfect for a weekend trip/holidays etc. I bought one for my Quaker and it\u2019s the perfect size. Great quality and such a great price for what comes with it. It would be an easy 5 star if I wasn't sent a dented package. The clip that holds the cage closed, pierced the box and was bent into a fashion I can't replicate. I took out the pliers and chipped away at the nice white finish.  It works. Also the bar spacing is fine for an English budgie Good carrier, easy to set up outside but it is difficult to fasten the food bowl holders on the inside so I never actually collapse the cage.  Lock is also a problem, will actually slide open on its own if it is jostled enough while carrying.  I expect larger, smarter birds will be able to open the door by themselves.  Not recommended for cockatiels or smaller. Bought for cockatiel to travel . Perfect size and sturdy. Dish holders are secured on to sides by you, with nuts n bolts. It looks like a decent size gerbil type cage, that is modified for a bird. Exactly as pictured. Very satisfied. Great travel cage for under $40 bucks.  I have a green check conure and it's big enough for her to spend a week in during a long vacation.  I wouldn't recommend it for long periods for a larger bird like an eclectus, grey or amazon but great for weekend trips or even just to take to and from the vet or hang out outside.  This cage is too small for anything larger then species listed above. This cage is ok for parrots.  It has wide spaces between bars, where parakeets would slide through them and potentially escape. Please make sure you\u2019re buying for a parrot. I reccomend  this cage to all my customers  for emergency  and all around travel cage. It has everything  needed but food, toys, and the bird. Nice little cage for the money  my Aurora (an amazon parrot) went right in and she was comfortable, using it so she can get some fresh air and sunshine Love this little to go cage.  Needed something for my little cockatiel to travel from my house to his sitter's house, and he can stay in it while he's there too!  The water and food bowl are moveable, so I can place it similar to how it is in his home cage.  That keeps him from being to psyched out with the changes. ", "Perfect for travel with my Green Cheek Conure. Returned it only because my bird almost got through the bars.  It\u2019s a young English Budgie. bought it so that we had an easy way to transport our conure  in case of an emergency, and we have to vacate.  looks great, and it is close to her cage, and easy to set up. Tried twice. Cage was bent both times as to be unusable. Guess it\u2019s total luck of the draw. Bought one before and it came through fine. Disappointed this one didn\u2019t. I ordered two of this, one for my Pionus parrot and one for my blue front amazon parrot. Both parrots went right in without any problems, and settled in for a ride right away. I had to buy a rope perch for my amazon because the wooden perch sat to high, and her head was almost touching the top of the cage, so to make it more comfortable for her i just changed it.  It is great for vet visits, car rides and to grab a little bit of sunshine outside. I do recommend to buy a clip to lock the door more securely.  As inquisitive as my parrots are, the current lock was not going to cut it!. Love this cage. Perfect transport bird cage for taking your bird to vet or groomer and for smaller birds like my cockatiel it makes a good cage for vacations with your bird. Perfect for a travel cage. I bought this so I would be able to transport my Lilac headed amazon to the vet as well as across country. It was plenty big enough for him and it is well made. I had read that there was a problem with the way the door closed and I was worried about that, but it was fine. My cage is well constructed and easy to use. I did a lot of research and came up with this item, I couldn't be more happier!! Sturdy construction folds for storage, I used it to take my cockatiel to North  Carolina a 13 hr ride, he did great, I recommend this carrier highly plenty of room but the large door can be a hazard for smaller birds that need to stay in the cage. This carrier turned out to be far better than I expected. I love that the poop tray is secured by a clip so that you can maneuver the cage without it falling out. It's much larger than I thought it would be (which is a good thing). The dimensions are accurate, I was just afraid it would be too small for my IRN. His tail does stick out a bit but it's never bent and he has enough room to move around comfortably. I use it to take him out to the courtyard of my building so we can enjoy the sun. ", "Love this cage for traveling with my Conures. They have plenty of room to move around and can see everything. THis is a great price. They love it to can see the action and everything thats going on. Bought these for a move to another state.  They worked well.  I am now using them as a cage to take my birds outside on the deck with me.  Well made and like the how easily they fold up when not in use. My Linnie likes to spend time in it. It's super easy to fold & unfold, big enough for my little parrot and she likes it. It was a great value for me. The only downside is that it's heavy, but that is why it's so sturdy I'm sure. Was so easy to assemble and is even greater that it collapses for storage under the bed when not in use.  Although I doubt that will happen.  Will be used to bring home the new baby Indian Ringneck Parakeet next weekend and when transporting her to clipping and grooming.  May even use it as a temporary cage in the bedroom while watching TV and she wants to be with me.  Her big happy cage is out in the living room to sleep in all night.  I thought this small cage was perfect.  I'm glad I got this one.  I'm sure it's going to serve multi purposes.  Might even use it for when she takes her baths. Having had parrots and let birds for years, this is by far the very best travel cage you can buy for the money.  It\u2019s lightweight, easy to clean, and has a good lock on the door. Excellent product, used it during evacuations of Hurricane for my Sun conure.  Is a perfect size and a wonderful option to place him in when cleaning his larger cage.  Great to place him outdoors in this unit for a little fresh air. Easy to install. Foldable (only when disassembled) . Cups holders are TOO small for the cups. Cups will not fit inside, and stay out. If fitted by force, it will be impossible to take them out for cleaning. See pictures. Great traveling cage for my quaker parrot!  There is no assembly other than screwing in the water and food bowls.  It took me 2 minutes to set it up.  It\u2019s stylish-looking and very sturdy.  It\u2019s such a great buy I just had to write a review to spread the word! NIght time cage for my grey. She loves it. Put some of those rope perches in there. Rehabbed a little bird and this was perfect. It's a nice size and folds down flat. It would be great for a small rabbit too, or a hamster or gerbil. Easy to clean tray. ", "This is the perfect little travel cage and also is used as our African Grey sleeping cage on a nightly basis. It comes with a pretty low grade wooden perch- i just replaced it with a rope perch and the food and water bowls are also included. This is the perfect size for him to fit comfortably. He hapily waddles in when hes ready to go to bed every night. I bought this as an \"away from home\" cage for my conure to use in a hotel when I went on vacation.  It folds up compact and fit right in my suitcase. Perfect for my aging yellow parrotlet, chip, who was lost in his former large cage.  He loves it, and it's very sturdy so even when my cat sits on top of it (i put masonite art panels on top so chip can t see him), the bird is secure.  More importantly, the bars are so narrow kitty can't get a paw through, so he's largely lost interest in chip. I rescued an injured pigeon at work and needed a temporary place for it to recover before releasing back into the wild. This cage has enough for it to stretch its wings. While the pigeon does not use the included perch, the dishes that came with the cage are used. I recommend this cage for a travel cage or a temporary set up. Good size, very sturdy and easy to put together.  I had to return it because the grates were too large for my parakeet (she popped her head out when I was using it on vacation!), but it's a great cage otherwise. Bebe approved! Great size for Quaker Parrot. Easy to put together and like the single door. Very good sturdy travel bird cage I recommend it and reasonable priced This is a very sturdy cage. Much like a small dog crate. Locks pretty well and bird seems comfortable when traveling.  I like that it comes with a perch and dishes. Exactly what we were looking for to transport out Quaker parrot Ritz. I love these cages SO much I bought SIX. Very nice cage. I only gave it 4 stars because the dishes & perch it came with are for very large birds & we just have a Bourke Parakeet. We easily added our own perches & replaced the dishes, tho. No problems with that. ", "Overall happy with product as it meets the purpose. Gonna have to zip-tie a few spots that feel wobbly, other than that, ready to go. Arrived promptly and was super easy to assemble. My birds love it. I'm happy with it for a traveling cage. This item did the trick.  We moved 2 birds and a cat in the cab of a truck about 800 miles.  The birds loved the cages and sang and talked the whole way.  The cat was not as happy.  The only issue we had was the the food bowls in one cage often became jammed.  They were easy to set up and we will use them for transporting the birds from now on. Great cage but spacing too far for my budgie. He kept sticking his head through the bars. He definitely would have got stuck if he kept trying to get out so had to send it back. If only the spacing was small I would so have lived to keep it. Bought as a second portable cage for my Amazon parrot, to fit on a stand and to travel with but it didnt work for me. Nothing wrong with it just didnt work for me and my bird. Good that it folds flat for storage. I loved it very spacious! I know I don\u2019t have it in the photo but that\u2019s because it\u2019s stored away but my sun conure fit in it very well and had a great 5 hour travel from it\u2019s home pet store Really nice travel cage.  Sturdy and collapsible for storage.  Buyers should be aware that this is a PARROT cage--not a parakeet cage.  My new little keet tried to squeeze through the bars and almost managed.  Depending on the size of the parakeet--she might break free!  Now that I'm a more seasoned buyer, I realize that parakeets need a 1/2 inch spread on the bars--3/4 inch is not ideal. Bought this for my BF Amazon. It fits her well size wise. The cups don't fit into the holders, which is a huge pain, if I hadn't needed it I would have returned it for that reason alone. A good, simple travel cage for my green cheek conure.  I deducted a star because I think it was a little overpriced, but it was as I expected and I'm satisfied for using it on occasion for travel. It does serve its purpose so I'll give it three stars, but it arrived dirty- very dirty.  There was black and gray soot covering all sides.  Even after cleaning it thoroughly, it seems the bottom will stay permanently stained.  There is rust under almost every hinge and the perch is cracked right down the middle and pretty much useless. ", "Love this travel carrier. Birds love it, comfy for longer car rides. I do not fold when not in use. Came on time just as described. Great travel cage for the money Really great travel cage for birds!  I drove my parrots 1500 miles and back with this cage and they were fine.  I had my Senegal and Green Cheek in there and there was plenty of room for them, as well as 4-5 different perches, hanging toys and the feed dishes. I recently went on vacation and while I was gone, my quaker parrot got to go to grandma's house so she could be spoiled.  I purchased this cage for her to stay in and she seemed to like it just fine - it's not too big and not too small.  The cage is easy to set up and folds flat when not in use, which I like.  It also comes with two bowls and a perch.  This is the cheapest travel cage I could find that still had quality construction. Easy to assemble, easy to clean, sturdy. Perfect travel cage for my lovebird! Perfect size, too! Thought it would be too small for her, but she loves it. Great little travel cage for a green cheek conure! Sturdy and well made.  However wire spacing is too wide for smaller birds like parakeets. What an awesome idea now my Tweety cam go where I go worry free. ", "This is a great cage. When I got my Indian Ring Neck, he came with a cat carrier. He clung to the front bars as he could not see out anywhere else. When I go away for business, I board my bird at the place I got but it is an hour away. Last time when I brought him there, he went in the cat carrier the day before I left, but then this cage came same day, so I quickly set it up and put it in my car so that when I picked him up, I could use this instead. Well, what a difference. He was so much happier!! Very calm, and seemed like he was actually enjoying the ride. Ring Necks have very long tails so the width was important as well as the length.This cage is great for him. Folds up easy. I took my Goffin's Cockatoo in a few trips this past month. The cage was perfect in size and shape for my bird. This is a very sturdy, well-built cage. The only con is that the handle is made from the same wire as the cage and does not have any padding. I covered it with a piece of tubing and then wrapped Co-flex around it to keep it from hurting my hand when I carried the cage. Great product for the price. Great for a large travel cage. Only critique is that the instructions are in the bottom of the cage and you'll basically have to assemble is entirely before you can read how to assemble it. I had to pull lthe pamphlet through the bars before I realized how to open the bottom drawer. Good and recommend to others. Only problem is to place the food. I think it would be good to open the section where we hand the food. Great little cage Easy to put together and easy to collapse.  Great to have if you don't have the largest space available.  I needed it for my Sun Conure when I head to the vet or if I decide to travel with him. I was bit afraid that it might be difficult to put together, but this was super easy to set up. My bird loves it and I love it. Easy to clean and spacious for lovebird. THANK YOU FOR ALL ", "nice easy to put it together. We have a medium size parrot who goes with us when we travel.

Easy to put together and plenty of room for my cockatoo to move around in it love this cage!  my two  parrotlets live in it except when they're out flying around in their room.  comfortable size.  is great for traveling with them as well. I used this for my parakeet and was not impressed. It was damaged and bent in several places. The bars were too wide and my bird squeezed out between the bars. The bottom pan doesn't fit into the tray right. It moves around and let's a lot of droppings out through the sides. I was disappointed to say the least. Need to put the directions where you can reach them I got 2 of these for RVing my parrots.  They are nice and sturdy. Nice travel cage for a small parrot. Great travel and short term holiday cage for our cockatiel. Very strong. Nice white colour. Our adult budgies can squeeze out of this cage and then gets stuck.

Folds flat which is great and can be set up quickly I am pleased with this cage. It is exactly as described. It was very easy to unfold and prepare for my bird. It's light weight and just enough space for my Caique while we travel. The only negative I can say is that I thought it was a bit overpriced. Although, I tend to think everything is just a bit overpriced. I would say $35 would be a more fair price for what you're getting. Compact, easy to assemble. Durable and the bird likes it. Great travel cage for car rides and such. Switched out the perch because it's not comfortable for my budgies. Love that it can be folded flat and packed away easily. If you are buying this for your bird please reconsider. It's a decent size but there are gaps in the door and the bottom that are too large for smaller birds. The cage isn't large enough in my opinion for a larger parrot, though. Such an awesome travel cage! And what a great price. I bought 2! Perfect design, I can collapse them for easy storage. I would not leave my black capped conure in this cage unattended. A bigger bird no problem. I wish it would specify not to get for which birds.

It's too small for a permanent cage, but she was perfectly happy in here with her old toys and perches for a week. Collapsible into a size that can easily fit into a large suitcase ", "I bought this cage to take my Quaker Parakeet to the nursing home. The residents comment how clean the cage is.

It'S a nice new house for my sweet bird. Pretty much no assembly required. Shipped very fast. He loves it. ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!! All my parrots love them! I have a blue front amazon, sun conure and a greek cheek. they all don't mind this cage at all when we travel. Did not know what to expect as it is hard to judge by a picture, was so pleased when it arrived this cage is perfect!! enough room for toys and extra perch as my African Brown Head likes to play and has his sleeping area. Perfect for a traveling cage or temporary. Its a perfect travel case for our african greys.  I purchased 2, 1 for each of them. Easy to assemble, easy to clean. Fits into a seatbelt in the car easily. Bird loves it! My Goffins cockatoo does fine in this. It's sturdy enough that I don't worry about her getting loose if she's unattended.Too small to stay in for more than a couple of days. I bought two of these for a cross country trip with my birds. This cage is just the right size for traveling with my Cockatiel.  It was extremely easy to assemble but I did reinforce the sides with zip ties. Very tight parts and it did not com with a perch.  Now it's too late to return it. ", "Good travel cage. We used this cage for moving our cockatiel across the country. It had plenty of room and was well constructed. It even had room for a couple of bird toys to keep him entertained. It\u2019s very nice and great quality. My Conure likes too! Very nice at great price. A nice size easy to pu together It's hard for me to open the cage door works well for the purpose This is a great little carrier.  It sets up and disassembles quickly.  The only issue is I have is that the plastic tray is rather flimsy and also the door must be opened completely before the tray can be removed.  The carrier is a good thing to have in cases of emergencies too. Lightweight and easy to clean. Folds down for storage. Great price and good product ", "I'm very pleased with this cage, I have two cockatiels and this cage is plenty big enough for them during trips. Good purchase! Meets our needs for additional space when we travel perfectly.  Folds up for storage when we don't need it and fits easily under the bed or in the trunk. I use for quilting This will be a perfect travel cage for our cockatiel. It is sturdy and complete and simple to fold away in one piece when not in use. There's nothing compared to it here in Brazil. My Bird can finally travel with comfort. PERFECT! A plus would I say it is how easy it can be put together. This cage is amazing!!! We took Rio to the park and he enjoyed it! He was comfortable and happy. Perfect size for a green cheek conure. Good quality food and water bowls and easy to carry because of light weight!! works for what I needed it for Easy fold for storage I have a sugar glider and travel quite often. This cage is perfect for her to take with me or leave at a friends. Collapses pretty small when she's at home for easy storage. Very happy with purchase. Great for bringing the bird to grandma's for bird sitting or taking on a camping trip. Has been well used and well liked. ", "My Cockateil is comfortable traveling in it. Unfold and voila instant travel bird carrier!  Will have to send an update once our newest bird comes home from the breeder! It's easy to clean and good cage Good quality cage. Big enough for my conure or 2 for vet visits or stay overs etc. Only thing that I didn't like was at the bottom of the cage where door is, there is only 1 latch. There should be 2 latches for sure! The bottom corner at door stays slightly open and unless u personally clip it shut somehow, if you have a frantic bird that likes to escape, don't get this cage. But if you have a calm bird that just perches and doesn't search for a route out, it's a great cage! My bird is very calm could care less if there was an escape. But I wanted to put that out there bc I know there are birds that are on the escape spectrum lol. :) This was great and worth every penny I spent. My cockatiels were happy as birds in a bath. Perfect fit for my Goffins Cockatoo for a travel cage. Ease of use for unfolding and folding back down for storage was a big plus. This is the second cage made by Prevue Pet Products I have purchased, having really liked the first. The cage is very easy to assemble and fold down. My African Grey has plenty of room to move about. Love it to travel with my bird.Good quilety and fast shiping. Very functional and nice. recommending it. Big enough for my quaker parakeet; he loves it when we travel in my camper van. Very sturdy and easy to setup or fold down. ", "Good cage None Great transport cage I like that it folded together so easily but it would have been great if it had arrived with all the parts. It came with the hardware missing for one of the food trays and we are leaving for our trip in two days. Too late to return it. Bigger than I expected, not too heavy, good concept Perfect size a comfort for my yellow naped  Amazon! Took him to the vet in it with ease and the vet even loved this Travel cage!! It works. Love this! I purchased this cage when we were moving to accommodate my cockatiel while traveling. It was ideal and a good size. Not too big and not too small. It is made well and I like that I can collapse it when I'm not using it and tray, perch and feeding cups are stored within the collapsed unit. The door doesn't shut all the way.  The bottom corner stays open, and the bird tries to wedge his head through the gap.  It is not a safe cage.  You would need to use twist ties to close the edge corners. ", "I gave this a 5 star rating because I own 4 other cages that could be used for travel as well.  I bought one closer to $100 but it was too heavy.  I had an appointment for my Quaker the day this arrived.  It is recommended that the parrot get use to the cage first but because of my unhappiness and awkwardness with the others I really wanted to try this one.  I was surprised at how well my Quaker took to this cage.  I also have a Miata so not all cages fit well.  This did.  This cage should not be used for a large parrot (not enough head room).  I read reviews for this one and took a chance.  I got home at 3 p.m. and had to leave for appointment at 4 pm.  In that amount of time, I fed wildlife, cats and put cage together (easy).  I wish others were as easy.  I did not even read directions (just looked at pictures).  I did put a rope in as well but my bird did not even go to it.  Perch was adequate. gives my african grey timneh a great home away from home, great emergency cage for severe weather and short trips. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure about a year ago.  I needed some kind of cage I could travel with because his home cage is HUGE and I take him everywhere. I absolutely love this cage!!! I have taken it on countless trips and it is just perfect. I has plenty of room for him to sleep, play, eat and hang out for hours at a time. I can put it up and take it down in less than 5 minutes. It's very easy to clean, as the floor tray slides out effortlessly and the coated bars wipe right down. The bars are spaced well and it's simple to add his toys and remove them when it's time to go. Very nice cage for small bird to vacation in. Plenty of room for small birds toys. We tool our conure on vacation with us and he had plenty of room to roam with all his toys. Easy to put together and very easy to store for next year .the cage collapse down for easy storage. Affordable price . Love it. My cockatiel fits perfect in it. She has lots of space. I bought 2 transport my cockatiel & conure during an out of state move. The cages were sturdy & sufficient for the trip. Both birds had to spend a few days in them & didn't seem to mind. The perch is too large for a cockatiel, so I had to add a smaller one. Really fast and my bird Jerry loves it . item performed as advertised, did what I bought it to do I have two cockatiels, and I use this cage as their carrier for trips to the vet, and also as a temp cage for when I'm cleaning their regular cage. It's very spacious, and there is plenty of room to fit your own perches and/or toys as well. cage well made.  very easy to assemble. dishes are made so birds cannot pull them out. would recommend.  very happy with this purchase. ", "I am loving the cage. I wanted something to use for carrying my finches to the vet, and I love the fact that it folds for storage until you need it the next time--major selling point for me. The cage is very good quality, but it was shipped with a missing piece This Prevue cage is made solid. Prevue is a good brand. It went together easily and perfectly. My bird is safe in it. My only problem is, in the description, it says this is for small parrots. I have a Green Cheek Conure, which is a small parrot. It's too big for him. The perch is too big and it's just oversized for him. Great cage.  Designed for medium or large birds.  My parakeets could stick their heads through the slate openings. Nice item good price Great Cages. easy to break down and set up. very secure and sturdy. good size for sort term use for vacation. thank you This is an amazing travel cage for my 2 Cockatiels! There is lots of room for them to stretch out their wings while we travel to vet appointments or friend's houses. Great buy! very pleased This cage was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived alot faster than I had expected, which is good because there was a little finch waiting to move in to it Easy to setup, and good quality. ", "It's just okay. My lovebird watched as I assembled it.  It was so easy.  As soon as it was finished he hopped in to check it out.  By the way, I purchased it for my cockatiel.  I think the bar spacing might be too wide for a lovebird or other small bird. It is extremely durable and was very easy to assemble - my little canary (Prince) loves his new home which is permanent but I will take it whenever I travel with him. The cage was exactly what we needed, we do a lot of camping and this will be our Conure's tent! It folds away to almost nothing and is as study as any parrot cage when erected. A small part to mount one of the steel dishes was missing but the cage itself is really good and easy to setup This is  great travel cage Nice cage, every thing as stated and very fast shipping! The cage is sold every where else  for a lot more! great for my birds should I ever have to leave because of hurricane. Soon after I bought this I had to take my Bird to the Dr.  I was so glad that I had it, it worked out great. My travel cages came in about 3-4 days.  Perfect for transporting my birds.  Thanks for being so expedient!  Love that it has cups too! ", "Great Traveling cage for my African great This is perfect for travel.  Trips in the car. It is easy to fold down and store. This worked great for our bird. I got this in preparation for a cross-country move with my cockatiel.  Even though I knew the dimensions beforehand, it is a LOT larger in person.  I am also concerned that it might be too large to fit under the airplane seat in front of me, and may require me to purchase a plane ticket for a cockatiel.  It is also quite heavy.  Now, for the good stuff:  I like how the bottom try locks in, and overall the construction is high-quality. Very practical for traveling. as advertised and easy to set up and take down. good So so for cheap travel cage. No washers to install clips for dishes. Perch doesn't fit well. It's a little too small to be secure in the cage. Would return if didn't use gift card to buy it. I was very happy with the bird cage.  I put it together as it was easy.  i am 73. The birdcage looks nice and it's roomy enough, but the parakeets I recently purchased have escaped three times and it worries me because I have a cat.  I had to throw a towel over each parakeet and put them back in the cage. Finally  I covered the entire birdcage with a densely woven lace curtain and tied the curtain under the birdcage to prevent them escaping.  This birdcage is obviously better for larger birds.  I had to order a new cage with 1/2\" spacing between the wires. My bird tries to not go in this cage.  Maybe because the size of her cage is like a mansion. Hoping it will serve a purpose if needed. ", "The cage came in quick time. Nice size, sturdy and light weight. We got it for my Cockatiel for moving her in my car and for travel. One less star because the wooden pirch was missing in the package & wish one side had horizontal lines because she likes to climb. I will let the supplier know about missing pirch, will let you know if they send it. Haven't opened the box yet but think I will love it Good quality Great travel cage Wasen't big enough! Now stuck with it! These cages are not big enough for Parrots! I purchased this for my cockatiel when I had to do a four-day drive and hotel stays with him. This is the perfect size for the car.  My bird likes to look out the window so I ended up placing a kitchen trash can on its side and putting the cage on top of that then seat belt the cage down. This cage works perfectly for it's intended purpose.  We have a cherry headed conure who we used to leave home (with a neighbor dropping in every day to take care of her) while we would go on vacation.  Well, you can imagine the abuse we would get when we got home, a week of barking and complaining.  We just figured it would be easier to take her with us, but we certainly didn't want to drag her full sized cage with us. I did not buy this on amazon, I bought this at another pet retailer during a big sale, but thought I would express my opinion of it. Hey! I just got this cage and assembled it & its so far easy to do it. It looks sturdy enough & little heavy. I have a African Grey and its just perfect size for her & it serve its purpose as a travel cage. In my opinion, People who say its only for smaller type birds then it defeats the purpose of a travel cage. Travel cages are suppose to be little smaller or exactly the bird size. It works for medium size birds & some large birds (not for XL birds or XS birds) My Indian Ringneck absolutely loves this travel cage, she spends more time in and on it than her bigger home cage. Putting it together was easy(minus my bird getting in my way as usual). Everything is already together pretty much, you just unfold it then connect the sides. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the cup holders being out of line. The cups would not go inside the holders so, I broke out the dremel and shaved down some of the metal. They fit very snug but work now. The instructions are clear but not really needed. Overall, you cannot beat the price for this type of quality. ", "This is a great travel cage. It fit into a carry-on (though I expanded the suitcase and ultimately did it as checked luggage).  The bars are farther apart than a normal cage for small birds, but my English budgies don't tend to challenge their cages.  You will have to provide/make your own perches. Downsizing my16yr old Canary who doesn't fly or perch anymore, and this cage is perfect. Our old guy stands on the floor mostly so love that there is a barred floor that keeps him up out of debris. It's very well made and cleans SO easy!! Great space for him-even the cage bar spacing is ok for his size. Could do without the huge perches and dishes that are way too big for our use. This cage is really roomy for my conure, I like to use it to take her around town, have her enjoy some sun, or take her to the vet. Some paint did come off initially upon assembly but overall it's pretty sturdy. Getting to the instructions was a bit of a hassle I wasn't expecting. The cage has a nice weight to it and is easy to clean. What I love most is it collapses easily so it takes up less room. If you want a practical travel cage for your feathery friend this would definitely be it! I use this cage for my cockatiel when i take him to the vet. easy to clean and i like that it came with food and water bowls. Only cons are that its kind of heavy, and the lock on the door is absolutely useless. The slide lock is loose and if you even tilt the cage to the side during transport, the lock will just slide right out and the door will open. However it's an easy fix with a chain and lobster clasp to keep it more secure. I chose this cage because of the large door that makes it easier to put my little guy inside. Overall a good travel cage. Fast shipping by the Amazon warehouse. I don't have Prime and got it in 2 days. I opened the box and the setup is extremely easy. No pieces came warped and nothing was missing. Cage size and quality is excellent especially compared to the cheap price. This is going to be a perfect night and travel cage for my Caique. May purchase more of this item in the future for my other parrots. Love this Cage. I have a sugar glider and use a very large bird cage for her, but I plan on acquiring another glider and needed a cheap cage I can use for her and travel. My only complaint is it came with two metal rings to secure food bowls inside and one of the two is so rusted the welded section broke. It is a great product considering its price, and fold up small enough I can store when not in use. Arrived quickly, assembled easily out of the box and looks great. Sturdy good sized cage that fits my daughters Cockatiel very well. Needed a smaller cage than she has at home for when my daughter sometimes comes over for the weekend and brings her bird because of the heat. Nice added touch for me is that it easily folds up and can be hidden away the rest of the time. It\u2019s a lot bigger than I thought it\u2019d be, but it\u2019s really high quality and my bird loves it!! He goes to the park everyday so the bigger size is great. He didn\u2019t like the perch, but it\u2019s a type I don\u2019t use with him so I suspected he wouldn\u2019t I've been using this cage to travel with my African grey for the last 5 years and it's still getting plenty of use! I've either tried or seen most of the other commonly used travel cages and still think this one is the best on the market for medium to medium-large parrots. It's not the sturdiest or the most lightweight, but it makes up for it in convenience (super easy to collapse and reassemble), its large size and cheap cost. I've definitely gotten my money's worth! Came on time.... some parts were bent ... however, for the price,  it's decent.... easy set up.... it's not really meant for small birds..perch and feeding/ water cups are way too big... ", "This is a great travel cage for my Conure. Easy to fold and unfold and Sully enjoys it. I love it .... great I wish the bowls had doors to open! I Breed My lovebirds in this cage amazing. Good quality cage BEST TRAVEL CAGE EVER We use as night cage for Quaker parrot and she loves it!! Perfect size for her warm sleeping area. Heating pad just fits, put a little sleeping box in the corner and she is one content little girl. 6:00PM - 6:00AM every night keeps a girl chirping. The pictures don't do it justice, we bought it as a moving case and kept it because our Cockatiel loves it which is great since it's 1/2 the size of his old cage.

It is perfect for my two cockatiels, and definitely has room for a few more. The boys have lots of room to flap and climb and plenty of room for lots of perches and toys. The cage is very sturdy and the measurements are true to the description. It pains me to leave a negative review for this product. I've had good luck with Prevue products in the past and have always felt they were a good company. If I had written a review for this cage a couple of weeks ago, it would have been 4 stars. The cage was a pain to assemble. The parts weren't labeled, a couple of the prongs were bent, and a few steps absolutely required an extra set of hands (which annoyed me, since I much prefer to do these things by myself). However, once it was put together, it was roomy and seemed good for the price. My two baby cockatiels also seem to like it! First of all I've published photos on Amazon of this product because I couldn't find any real life pictures or images of the Prevue Hendryx F050 Wrought Iron Flight Cage, X-Large. I have 7 Zebra finches, 3 males and 4 females, they are all 3.5-4.5 inches long and weigh no more than half an ounce. Super awesome for the price!!! My 8 parakeets LOVE this cage!!! It gives them tons of flying room. I also got one for my 2 cockateils and sun conure and they love it too!! The quality is excellent!! I highly recommend this cage :o) This is such a great cage! I have a cockatiel and I had been housing her in a cockatoo cage that I happened to have on hand up until I purchased this cage, and while it worked ok, it really wasn't species appropriate for her. The bars were very thick and she just couldn't get around as easily as I wanted her to be able to which also caused issues with her slipping and falling and damaging her tail feathers. The bowls for it also weren't working out. They were so large her tail was always soaked with water. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if it wasn't for a few things: So far, so good. Took us a few minutes to figure out how it put together, but it's pretty easy once you get the base. I went over it with my hands and eyes and looked for flaws, and I didn't see anything. I was doubting getting this cage after reading a few reviews that weren't too good, but I just took the risk. I don't regret it. I can't wait to get my 2 parakeets in here, I think they'll LOVE it! I love this cage! My sparrow loves it even more! The cage is large, sturdy, and really well made. I am so happy with the purchase. I love the four food/water containers that came with it, as well as the 3 wooden perches. Someone used this cage, returned it and then it was resold to us. The floor of the cage is still stained with bird poo, it came without instructions and seems to be missing pieces. The seller simply resold it without inspecting it. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time and money. I read so many reviews on this and decided to give it a try and now I am returning it. Multiple welds are broken, two of the screws won't go in (they don't even fit the size of the hole it's supposed to go in. The spring doors on the sides don't latch in any way so any animal (bird, mouse, sugar glider, etc) can easily push them open and escape! Thankfully I ordered via Amazon prime so return and refund is easy. ", "Terrible shipping experience was just the tip of the iceberg, but I guess I can't talk about that since my previous review \"couldn't be posted in its current form\". I should have known better than to purchase a cage online. I should have just saved up and bought a Double Critter Nation, Congo, or Brisbane. I know this is a bird cage, but since they really don't make any cages specifically for sugar gliders, I was hoping to get a decent cage at a decent price, since I'm a disabled veteran living on a fixed income. This cage is quite flimsy, shouldn't have passed quality control, and will no doubt need replaced in a few months! There's a pretty large gap between the slide out grate and the bottom of the cage. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but since the grate is very cheaply made (cheaper than a knock off Brisbane that I own. I was buying this cage to replace it because of the rust after close to two years of owning), it flexes with the least bit of pressure. There was only one bent bar, but nothing that can't be fixed. One of the side, spring-loaded doors, doesn't work properly and will stay open, when pushed open. This really doesn't matter much because I've zip tied them all closed, since sugar gliders would definitely be able to open them. Another one of the side doors, the long, straight part of the spring, meant to give resistance, broke free, causing the paint to chip down to bare metal. This will surely rust quickly! One of the front doors, was so tight around the bar is supposed to swing freely from, that simply opening it, caused paint to scrape off, to the bare metal. Another spot that will rust quickly! There are a few spots on the cage that the paint was scraped off, straight out of the box. The drop pan is the worst quality I've ever seen! It's so flexible, when barely resting my arm on it, while trying to zip tie my floor stand of my sugar gliders wheel to the bottom grate, it bent so much that it fell out of the rails it's meant to slide in and out of. This definitely takes 2 people to put together. I will update with pics later, it's been pretty much an all day affair between finding the missing package that was supposed to be here yesterday, putting it together, and getting it ready for my sugar gliders. I need to use my other phone to take good pics so you can see the issues I'm talking about. Great cage for smaller breeds of parrots -- Cockatiels, Budgies, etc. Bigger breeds could possibly bend some of the bars or potentially open up the cage, so I'd avoid it for anything bigger/stronger. I got it for half the Price on Amazon that I've ever seen the identical model in-stores. $90 vs $180), so while it definitely has its flaws, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I'm going to reiterate what many past reviewers have stated, but I have to give credit where credit is due. This cage has lived up to my expectations. I had been searching to find a spacious, efficient, well-built cage for a good price. After a lot of researching, this was the best cage I found for its price regarding material (sturdy wrought iron), size (internally 23\" depth, 37\" across, 47\" high), and design (easy to clean, move, and access). I know several past reviewers have mentioned that it came with damaged or missing parts, but I believe that Prevue has resolved this. This cage came extremely secure and well-packaged, with all parts present and intact. I found that the instructions, one double-sided page with pictures, are pretty simple and straightforward. If you can tell which parts are which and you have a helping hand to hold them together, it shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes to assemble this. 5 stars for loving the cage design after assembling and 5 budgies love it also. Flexibility of door sizes and location, see excellent, I use brown craft paper, 55lb from bulk roll ordered from amazon, most economical so I can change paper daily, like the pull our tray easy to clean w disinfectant wipes and it slides back in under the wired bottom so birds can't touch it anyway. The craft paper is on top of the bottom wired shelf so they can run around easily without tearing or sagging, their feet aren't on the grill bottom this way, nice and smooth. To simply say that this cage was defective  and poorly crafted would be insufficient. Yes, it came with two broken dishes, and several parts were bent. Some of the holes were poorly drilled or drilled at an angle or not drilled at all. However, it was the AGONY involved in putting this cage together that is the crux of my 1-star review.  Had I attempted to assemble this cage before it was past the return window, it would've gone right back in the box to China. Honestly, as a parent who has put together numerous and impossibly intricate toys the night before Christmas, I have never quite experienced the misery involved with putting this cage together. My helper got so frustrated less than half way through, that she quit and stormed off cursing the cage and those who fabricated its pieces.  Four hours later, I completed it alone, but only after creatively devising fasteners that would grasp the angled drill holes, frantically emptying my tool box over the floor desperately seeking just the right tool or screw that would make it all come together, and getting out my electric drill to make holes where there were none. And so many times, that glimmer of hope - when all the bars and screw holes on one side of the cage were finally aligned - was suddenly dashed when I realized the bars and holes on the opposite side had unaligned themselves because the part was bowed. As a final blow, the two of the four dishes that were not broken, didn't fit the bar spacing. The only consolation I have for buying this cage is that my canaries seem to like it, and what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. The cage is decent, seems sturdy, however LET THIS BE A WARNING TO ANYONE ABOUT TO BUY: There were multiple spots on the cage bars where there was very, very sharp metal sticking out. I had to use a file and pliers to dull the metal enough that it wouldn\u2019t rip my cockatiels feet open when he was climbing (I have cuts and punctures). Quality control needs to step up because it was nonexistent on mine. 2 of the cups came broke (as expected) and the spring nonsense on all those side doors needs replaced. If you dont want to use the grate and have a small bird (like me) you can put the tray inside the cage and slide it down to the bottom. Its actually more secure this way as it kept falling out of the track anyway and there is no gap at all for the bird to get stuck in or for things to fall out. I bought this extra large cage for my two cockatiels so they could have some more space to play while I am working. It is now their full time cage because we love it so much! Super-fast shipping! All pieces were included, no damage, took me about 30 minutes to put it together by myself--very easy. Great quality cage, my 3 parakeets love it! Easy to clean. I like that there are two big doors on the front, one at the top and one at the bottom. Makes it very easy to access their food, switch out their toys, and clean. I took away a star because I don't understand why all the little doors on the sides aren't secure like the big ones on the front. I had to bend paper clips to hold the doors shut, since they open out from the cage and my birds would easily escape. Still, this big cage was much less expensive than the smaller one I purchased at the big chain pet store. Great value, good product, happy birds! I got this as a cage upgrade for my green cheek conure. For the price, it is an incredibly large cage. I like having the two doors to easily clean the cage and move around perches and toys. The assembly was definitely a two-person job, but it didn't take much physical strength or any special tools. Some of the panels were slightly bent when they arrived, as other people had said. The assembly process bent it straight again, other than a few slightly bent individual bars. I had to secure the spring-loaded side doors I wasn't using with zip ties and used clips on her food and water doors, as she could easily escape by just pushing those open. Not sure why then included such an easy locking mechanism on the large doors but nothing on the side doors. Regardless, this is by far the best cage I could get for her for the price, and I'm really happy with it. I would rather get her this and let her have room to fly and climb all over the place than get her a smaller cage from a more reputable seller that didn't have issues with bending or had better locks, as those are easy problems to fix. None ", "After having this cage for quite some time, I can attest that my society finches adore this cage. It is literally an aviary for them and they love to flit about. It is easy to clean and the doors provide excellent access for food, water, nesting stuff, toys, millet spray, and baths...or whatever else you put in your birds cage (mine are spoiled so...). Assembly took about an hour (2 person job, limited space to move around) and it's pretty sturdy. Rolls really well and the storage is handy, though the compartment isn't very large underneath. I would definitely recommend this cage to anyone that has birds that are parakeet sized or smaller. It is NOT for larger birds as their intelligence and bite strength would render the spring loaded doors useless. It's a huge, beautiful cage. Easy to put together, but definitely need two people. My budgies are in awe over the size and jumping all over with excitement. It was sweet to see how happy they were to be in it. BUT.... Two out of three food trays are useless because one of the hooks on each of them didn't fully form so they won't hook to the cage. Another thing I noticed, and this probably just part of having such a large, tall cage.... But hanging toys is difficult. I've had to put all their toys on chain links to bring them lower so my birds can reach them. But, all in all the cage is beautiful, spacious and worth the money. They do need to replace my food trays though. : ) I took off one star for the food dishes. Those should have been inspected by quality control and never been allowed to be sent out like that. I haven't had a bird in a long time,  but my dog, cat and I decided that it was time for the trifecta. I decided on an English budgie. I had heard from everybody that you should get the largest cage possible and athough I just got one bird (but I might get another one after Sydney has bonded with me), I decided on this Prevue Pet flight cage. I am thrilled that I did! It was easy to put together by myself and I am a 66 year old woman. I love the fact that the two doors on the front are absolutely huge and allow access to pretty much the whole inside of the cage. Also, the three doors on each side of the cage (6 in total) allow access to reach anywhere on the back wall of the cage to place toys or perches or millet. I took the two feeding stations and put them side-by-side on the back of the cage, which makes for a kind of a buffet for Sydney -very easy to reach from the side doors and I just like the fact that it was in the back for some reason. I like the look and I like the way that I can have toys hanging on either side of it. The cage bottom grid and the cage bottom plastic tray are easily reachable and fine. There is a little shelf under that which is toward the bottom of the cage (you can see that in the photograph) and you can either find a plastic container that fits it almost exactly at Ikea or Home Depot or you can split up your bird items into very colorful shoebox kind of containers that are super cheap at Michaels. The shoe box containers have little slots on the front of the boxes that you can mark what is in the box. So I have millet in an airtight bag and I put that in one box and I have extra toys in another... you get the idea. Some people might think that this cage is an overkill for one budgie, but I don't think it is. It looks great and there are toys that Sydney loves like the rope & wood bridge that I can hook up diagonally on the sides of the cage. Anyway, I can't think of anything I don't like about it. Oh! I did want to mention that my cat, Oliver Wendell, likes to sleep on top of the cage so my idea was to get a piece of plastic or lucite or something and cut it down so that Oliver's paws wouldn't go through the wires.  I found that the plastic was a lot more expensive than I wanted to spend, so I found a wonderful solution. At Home Depot where they sell outdoor welcome mats they have rolls of vinyl runner material that is about $2.40 a foot. I bought three feet of a semi-clear/slightly frosted vinyl and trimmed it down to fit the cage top.  It's perfect!!  I will be building a homemade play gym for Sydney and the mat will be easy to clean.  Enjoy your birds!!! I purchased this cage for my 5 budgies as my heavy duty cage they were living in did not fit through the doorway of my new home. This cage does the job for now but there are some very large gaps between the frame and the first bar in the panel. This gap could cause issues with smaller birds, which is obviously what this cage is made for based on the fact there are no fastenings of any kind to keep the side doors closed. It relies entirely on 1 spring. A medium or larger bird could definitely figure out how to get out. This makes the gaps even more questionable as it creates a potentially dangerous bar spacing issue. There's also a large gap at the bottom of the cage where the bottom panel meets the last bar of the side panels. The bottom tray of mine keeps popping out and creating another gap, but this one only allows bird poop to escape onto the bottom shelf. Several of the panels also came with bent bars, which shows the material of the cage isn't very strong and could potentially be broken off by even a medium sized bird. I do like the fact that it has a shelf on the bottom for storage. This cage is most likely okay for smaller birds, and it'll make due until I can move somewhere I can go back to their better constructed cage. Their other cage is 30\u00d730, and the inside space is similar. It has a slide lock on all the access panels and an actual lock on the front. This one only had a bar you lift up on the main doors, much like smaller cages. I actually paid less for my nicer cage at the time. I feel like this cage is overpriced for how poor the construction of it is. The bars are thin and bent, the large gaps between the panels. These are markers of an inferior product. So,  I have a single very spoiled parakeet. I bought this aviary cage for Angel as an upgrade from the Haggen Vision L - Long, which I loved because it was so easy to clean. Let's face it my gymnast jungle chicken needed more room! This cage is more than double the size. I like the ball casters ( wheels) and the large front doors. I have an issue with the side doors however. The side doors can be pushed from the inside, meaning you can just pull on the door at it will open. They are also spring mounted - so I would be worried that a bird could push on the door enough to squeeze through or worse get stuck and strangle. I have the doors zip tied shut for now but I will be using metal clips as soon as I have them to \"lock\" the doors.  If the doors opened inward or had a latch this would not be a problem. I decided not to use the bottom grate, as Angel likes to run around on the cage bottom. I put the tray in the top slot, and there is a slight gap there, so I use a couple small clamps to hold it tight to the bottom of the cage frame. I have seen budgies squeeze through some very small places if they want to bad enough.  Overall I think it's a good deal for the money and quick delivery via Amazon is always a plus. I would get the add on cover, as it covers the whole cage. Prevue don't go up in price because this cage is already on the high end pricing.  With that being said it is a great home for cockateils/multiple cockateils/Quakers/multiple parakeets etc.. Roomy; light weight; easy to wipe down & clean; rollers make it easy to move to clean the floor(birds have no manners in regards to that, lol).  Just don't increase the price because it is not made like the heavy quality bird cages. All in all it works for us. I had purchased two and my cockateils all went in one, so I adopted two Quakers for the other.  Nice clean look in my bird room. None We absolutely LOVE this flight cage for our pair of Bourke\u2019s parakeets. My handy husband easily assembled it in 45 minutes. The rolling casters are fantastic and make it easier to move the cage to clean under and around it. That said, I wish this cage came with angled seed guard panels, as some other cages do, because it does not contain the mess at all. At the least, the manufacturer should pair it with a mesh seed skirt that fits it. There may be one available but I haven\u2019t been able to find it. Anyway, back to the positives, my sweet little birds are very happy in their home. I loved that it came with three wooden dowels, although parakeets like to fly side-to-side, so I replaced two of the perches with shorter ones that go across the short dimension of the cage. I also love that the cage came with four double seed dishes. They are terrific. I put in my own stainless steel water bowl and lots of toys. Happy birds, happy owner. Highly recommend. Edited after dealing with customer service. I have 26 small to medium size Parrots. whenever I need a new cage, or toys or sundecks, I always look for the Pet Preview name. Very good quality! My birds love to have the room to fly in their cage. All of my birds are rescued and have some kind of problem, that makes it so no one wants to adopt them. But to me, they are all beautiful! The cages you offer make the lives, of these misfit birds, very wonderful. thank you, so very much for offering the type of items that you do. Carol. update, Just received my 3rd cage from Prevue Hendryx, and put it together by myself. It helped me to use zip ties,( not tight ), to  hold the bottom parts together before putting the bolts in. Quality is very good and the birds, I put in it, liked all the space. THANK YOU AGAIN! ", "Overall, I'm really happy. I use this for my budgie and he loves it, he has plenty of room to fly and play with his many toys. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge, but considering I've never put together any furniture before and I'm a 5'4\" tall girl, it was fairly easy. However, I'd recommend a step stool for putting together the top portion. My was also a little bent, but some pliers fixed the worst of it. I bought this cage several months ago and it looks great and is easy to clean. I've put together so many cages in my life that I can do it with my eyes closed- not this one. Not only was it horrendous to assemble, but pieces were bent requiring a hammer to straighten- but the biggest issue is that the two HOLES WERE MISSING in the top left side panel to screw the other half on the top on. I ended up zip-tying the entire top and reinforced wiggly areas. The only reason I'm not sending it back is because of the hassle of disassembling and mailing it- prime or not. I was so excited for this cage to come in! This cage was a royal pain in the tushie to assemble. Several of the pegs were misaligned with the holes and required bending with pliers and the holes for the screws were of inconsistent size. It took two people over an hour to get the silly thing together, and half of it was trying to hold everything in alignment so we could get the screws in place. I use this cage for my Diamond Doves. I have four of them and this cage is spacious enough for them to get exercise in while I'm away for the day. However, this cage isn't necessarily for ground feeders like doves. You can't ground feed with the wire rack installed. With only the bottom tray in, without the bottom wire rack, there is too much room and small birds could potentially escape. So I left the wire rack in, and just placed butcher paper on top of the wire. My birds seem to be happy with that. I loved this cage, for the first few weeks. Then it started to sway. The bolts became loose. I'd tighten them but they'd loosen if I barely touched the cage. Today, when I went to bring him out, I saw it had completely fell apart. The metal warped and rusted. The bottom dropped out. Its unfixable. I'm pretty pissed off, and I spent a good part of the morning swearing. My poor bird could have escaped and flown into our ceiling fan! I tried for hours to fix it and its impossible. I have literally had this for less than a year. I want a refund!! My bird has to live in his bad back up cage now. I can't express my anger enough. Oh and checking reviews, it seems alot have had this issue. Faulty product that can lead to an escaped or injured bird!! I'm giving this product a 4 stars, only because the first time it was sent to me it had 3 of the same pieces when I only need two, so that made a two piece part, 1 short. Anyway, they sent me a replacement with 2 day shipping and it came great, none of the bowls were broken either which was a plus because in the previous one they sent. Two bowls were broken but I didn't really care because I already have my own feeding bowls, it was easy to set up. I only need some assistance one time and that was to screw in a piece. Some of the pieces don't match up very well, you have to kind of bend them and work it around but over all this is a great looking cage, very simple. And my birds are adjusting well! Thank you! Welp, here's how this went. I really cannot say enough good things about this moderately priced, very roomy cage for small-to-medium sized birds.  I've wanted a flight cage for my cockatiel for a very long time and this cage is just great.  It arrived with a careful and accurate inventory of all pieces, the instructions for assembly were very, very good, and while it suggests having two people available to assemble, I (5ft tall female) was able to accomplish it all by myself in about an hour.  All doors are in good working order. all bars 1/2\" spaced and entire surface a light powder-coat finish that is entirely smooth and safe for my bird.  My cockatiel loves his new home.  He loved having the space to adequately stretch his wings (spent nearly the first two days doing little else), and now feels he has the space to splash in a bath.  All of these behaviors were repressed in his much smaller (but standard cockatiel-sized cage).  I absolutely recommend this cage as an economical option for any small-medium sized bird owner who loves their feathered baby and wants them to have the best option for safe and healthy and happy accommodations. EDIT: my sun conure approved too. It's a really good cage. Despite bars being vertical she manages climbing very easily as there's horizontal bars often enough for her to grab with her beak. She loves to play on top of the cage running around on it or playing in the little play top I sometimes put there. She has figured out the doors in two days, but I use dog leash stainless steel hooks so she can't escape. She doesn't try either, she was just playing with the doors as a puzzle. The cage is big enough for a conure, and she's out in the morning and at night. She seems to like her home. Every time she goes back to the cage she seems to say hello to it by doing the greeting stretch they do. ", "I have 10 zebra finches and eventually want to make or buy a furniture/wooden style aviary but am currently in an apartment so this is fine in the meantime. I was weary about getting this cage after reading the reviews. My biggest concern was that it would be extremely difficult to put together, but it isn't. The directions are not that clear, and the pieces are not labeled, but I put this together in less than an hour. I did have my (disabled) husband hold a few pieces in place while I worked. I would recommend that you have someone to help you as it is easier to align everything, but it can be done by one person. As far as the finish - it looks great - kind of a black and silver hammered finish. It is sturdy enough for my small parrot and I had no trouble with the bottom pan falling or not fitting, it fit right in and stayed there. I am not a fan of the spring loaded doors on the sides, my Quaker Parrot figured those out pretty quickly (within a few hours) so I just put some hair clips on them for now to keep them shut. I'm glad I went with this cage, especially after the price drop to $89.99 Prime, this cage is huge, and you wouldn't be able to get something this size in a pet shop for under $300.00. The only reason that I am giving four stars and not five is that I personally think that those doors are a terrible option and the large front doors could latch down better. Be a bit careful or use some clips if you have an escape artist like I do. So this review is from the perspective of a person who is using this cage for rats. None I purchased this item to use for my 2 y/o iguana to hang outside with us on the patio. It took 2 of us to put together and my husband is pretty handy- just an awkward, unbalanced puzzle until you can get the screws in. We had to bend the panels straight again. They were slightly bent (possibly in shipping) but just put a knee in the center and it'll work. Not sure what that says about the sturdiness. I had to assemble two of these beasts after moving into a new house so we could easily transfer our birds to new, clean cages. This cage was recommended to me. Now, I should preface this by saying that they do earn an extra star for being semi-functional after the torturous assembly process. I bought this as a cage upgrade for my three sugar gliders. This is an amazing cage that offers a lot of open space, which is perfect for sugar gliders or other small climbing animals. The locking doors and tight bars have ensured no late night escapes. We did tuck the small spring-hinged doors on the sides in to reduce chances of them being pushed open, but I personally find them too small/inconvenient to have used regardless. My one criticism would be that the front doors could also be bigger to make reaching in and adjusting cage accessories/interacting with your pets easier. Pros:  My 5 zebra  finches love the cage, it gives them lots of flying room and room to get away from each other.  It is easier to clean but there are some downsides to that, see below. This cage is exactly as advertised. It arrived in excellent condition with all the parts and pieces. The feeding and water trays are made of hard plastic and all were intact. I would highly recommend having two people to put this together. It took two of us about 45 minutes to assemble, but I think it would have been frustrating to attempt it alone. If the parts were labeled, it would make it a little easier, but it's not too hard if you take your time and look at the pictures. We took the advice of another reviewer and did not fully tighten all the screws until completed. There were a couple bent rails but they were easily shaped back into place and did not compromise the value or integrity of the cage. I read a review that said there were sharp pieces that injured a bird. This concerned me and I inspected my cage thoroughly. The only somewhat sharp parts I found were on the spring hinges of each small side door. It would be a fluke for the bird to fly close enough to these areas, but I didn't want to take a chance so I put a little piece of black electrical tape over them (pictured) just to be extra safe. There are two large doors on the front of the cage that can be left open if you want your birds to fly in and out. I saw this exact same cage advertised with a pet store chain for three times the price. I think my parakeet is going to love his new home. I have provided a picture of his old cage to compare size. In my opinion this cage is suitable for small birds only. It's a great value and definitely an improved quality of life for our fine feathered friends. So the positive is the cage is steady and super large for all my conure's toys and needs to explore. For an inside cage this large, you can't really beat the price. ", "Wow, I'm really impressed with this cage!  It arrived in a big square box, quite heavy (for me)...of course it had the Made in China stamp on the box, which made me wonder if it was going to be a piece of crap. On the contrary, this is a GREAT cage...sturdy...heavy enough that my cats cannot get at my finches and canaries. Instead of the perches included, I got branches off my apple tree and made a really cool natural looking habitat for my birds, complete with toys like mirrors, etc.  There were four double feeding bowls. All the parts to the cage were made very well, and had some weight to them. My 16 yr old son put the whole thing together within a half hour and just needed me to hold the first two pieces together until he could put the base on...they he was able to do the rest without help. Screws were easy to put in, everything matched up. I have no complaints, and all I can say is that this was very much worth the money. Happy with my purchase!! Received the flight cage and it came with a wrong base piece. I had to write the manufacturer to get the correct piece. After almost 2 weeks, I received the correct base and was able to assemble it. I assembled it myself but it would have been easier with 2 people. This cage is really big and the my tiny finches are enjoying it very much. I like that it is on wheels, making it easy to clean around it, that it has a storage shelf to store their food and I like all of the doors, especially the big ones because it is easier to get inside to clean. The company is easy to work with to get the correct pieces but I was annoyed that the box didn't have all of the correct parts. I'm glad that I didn't need it right away and could wait for the correct part. It is a sturdy cage that is easy to clean. I'm glad to have it. This was flimsy from the moment I put it together.  The tray on the bottom doesn't fit the slots, so it's not usable.  Every time I clean it out, I have to have someone hold it back in place while I pile books and magazines underneath it just to keep it from collapsing.  It was a complete waste of money; there's far better quality cages for lower prices. This is a pretty big cage. It's not super difficult to put together but it does take several minutes to figure out all the side panels and match up the instruction pictures. It took me and my boyfriend about 45 mins or so to put it together. There were no missing pieces, just the top of the cage was slightly bent on one bar near the front but it's not noticeable. Great for the price. My tiels (I have 3) seem very happy and relaxed, and I enjoy that it has many doors for me to get to things in a pinch. It is crazy easy to clean, and the roll weels are easy to manage but not so loose that it jiggles around. My caique broke the welds off of some of the wires from this cage.. def not safe for anything larger than a cockatiel. Before I even bought this my avian vet ok\u2019d the dimensions, bar spacing and bar width.  I\u2019d return this but I threw out the packaging. She\u2019s a rescue and legit ripping this cage apart. Side doors should come with locks. Should not be advertised for small/medium parrots. Total garbage for anything larger than lovebirds, cockatiels or finches. \ud83d\udcab  You just can\u2019t find a large cage with the proper space between bars for sm/med birds in the heavier duty cages ,especially for this amazing price\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Package was late by 3 days, which I couldn't understand since it was sitting in a warehouse just about an hour away from me. After reading reviews about Ontrac I was really worried I wouldn't get it at all. I needed a cage pretty bad as I rescued a finch from a very bad situation so I ended up having to go to Petsmart and spent roughly $250 on another cage. It finally showed up in a box that was beat up and ripped and honestly I feared the worst about how the contents held up. To be honest my original plan was to send it back, since I already had the $250 cage from Petsmart but curiosity got the best of me and I decided to set it up. The reason I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to manipulate one piece with a hammer to make the cage fit together.I was able to assemble the cage by myself. It took about 2 hours, It would have been easier with a helper. Let me start out by saying that I purchased the XL cage! After reading the reviews I thought that it was going to be a nightmare to assemble. It wasn\u2019t. 6 Months pregnant and I was able to put it together by myself in under 30 minutes. The only issue I had with assembly, was that the parts aren\u2019t labeled. They\u2019re labeled on the instruction sheet, just not on the actual product pieces. That was honestly my main issue with it as a whole. A few of the bars were bent, and it was addressed in the instructions that it happens during shipping. But, I personally feel that it could have been packaged with more protection to avoid the bent bars issue. Another thing I noticed a lot of people complaining about, was the spring loaded doors being pushed outwards. I personally flipped the pieces so that the doors opened to the inside and it made a world of difference! It also eliminated any sharp pieces from the springs being on the inside. I totally recommend flipping the panels. Overall it\u2019s a very nice cage for a very inexpensive price! ", "I ordered this for my budgie, and he loves how much space there is. I need to go shopping for more toys since it looks so bare now! Cage came with plenty of screws, all of which went in with no problems (I had 1 extra) and complaints of bent bars didn't bother me (come on people, use pliers/your fingers and just fix it. With the way they package it in its box, it's going to happen sometimes in transport). Mine had a couple MINOR cosmetic bends here and there that I fixed in 2 seconds. Assembly went smoothly for me, and though you CAN do it alone, having at least 1 other person makes it go way faster. Once assembled, it's plenty sturdy and the wheels are nice. nice roomy cage that will be used for finches.  Light gauge wire and spring loaded side doors make this iffy for parrot types including keets.  Doors would need snaps or some type of secured latch.  No attached bottom, just the wire slide and the plastic tray, so need to make double sure both are not out at the same time.  A few spots had some larger gaps but nothing major.  Lots of room for small birds to fly and roomy enough for real branches.  *Absolutely* needs 2 people to put it together and at least one of you need to have enough patience to keep the other from melting down ;-)  Instructions are actually pretty decent, and you have to take your time to carefully hold things together while the other person screws.  Everything fit together well.  It took the 2 of us less than an hour to assemble. UPDATED REVIEW: I still love the space of this cage but for the price I expected quality to be better. Less than 5 months of putting our 2 cockatiels in this cage and the horizontal bars that are welded to vertical bar are now breaking the welds she the cars move freely and cause harm to my birds. I'm having to zip tie many of these until I can save up for a better quality cage. PLEASE CHECK THE BARS REGULARLY!!! The cage had a bent piece when it arrived.  No worries, I contacted them and they replaced the part. UPDATE: Love the cage, the two parakeets STILL (11/24/18) love it too.  Plenty of room.  Also, the three perches that came with it are fine for their little \"feet\".  I found that the tabs holding the plastic trays that come with it to the inside of the cage don't last long - rather than ask for new ones, I have a drill...put a hole under the tabs which broke off and I can use twine or something safe to TIE them to the cage...works just fine! This is a great cage for the price. Its sturdy and looks great in my house. It was moderately smooth to put together and took about 30 minutes. It is super easy to clean and the plastic tray is sturdy. Purchased this cage for a new Budgie (Parakeet). Shipping was very fast! It took my dad and I about an hour to get it put together correctly. You will need at least two people but it isn't impossible to do it by yourself. Just lay everything out with the doors facing the correct way. I did not need to use any zip-ties. The tray at the bottom pulls out nicely without any issues. Its a MANSION for 1 budgie but I could see 3 living comfortably with toys, coconut huts, water/food dishes and plenty of fun ways to get around. **I know our budgie is going to LOVE his new Crib!** I\u2019ve bought this flight cage for my two new parakeets, and just received it yesterday. I researched enough to know that I should stick with 1/2-inch bar width and get the biggest cage I can. This fits the bill! The large is huge for parakeets, plenty of room for toys and flight. It was remarkably easy to assemble, even though I did it myself. Tip: use the box to get started because it helps hold the legs upright while you attach the first screws. Cage comes with three cage-width perches and four large food/water dishes, which wasn\u2019t super prominent in the description. I do wish the wheels locked. **Maybe the manufacturers will see that.** Overall, it\u2019s exactly what I expected, at a reasonable price, and it seems solid. I hope my new birds love it! I was on the fence about purchasing this cage for my Amazon Parrot since many of the reviews say its not built all that strong. I must say it has held up to my bird rather well. The spring returns for the small side doors are very easily opened by larger birds like my amazon and thus may need to be fastened with something stronger for other large birds. The cage comes with 3 perches, 4 food  bowls, and no easy directions. The food bowls do not slide into the cage spacing but generally need to have some force added to get them properly seated. The perches are also not large enough in diameter for my amazon to stand comfortably, so either compensate by adding various larger perches around the cage or completely changing out all perches. I was annoyed by the lack of directions but once the pieces are all laid out in front of you and you take a look at photos of the cage it will come together. The cage is not built to withstand too much stress but it handles my parrot biting the bars and playing around rather well. Be sure that when you put it together all the bar ends go in the holes in the receiving bars, if not it will create a hazard to your bird and they will eventually get hurt by it. Seeing as when i purchased the cage there was only other review for someone who used this as an amazon cage I'm glad I tried it out. The bar spacing is not too small for my particular parrot but, be sure to research for your bird so they don't hurt their feet. I very much like the rack under the cage where I can store various supplies and food for my bird. I do recommend getting a play stand for the top of the cage so your bird can come out of his territory and feel more neutral to be played with, the top will be able to hold a decent amount of weight (5ish pounds) without sagging. I have not tested that over time but it currently does not have problems. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll get you the best answer I can! ", "Great pricing, free shipping, arrived in excellent shape, nothing bent or broken, I bought mine for sugar gliders, and it is perfect for them. Easy peasy to slide out and clean the tray, enough access doors for checking sleeping pouches and hanging the food dishes, bars are spaced for these little fliers. Doors are big enough to easily pull out the exercise wheels and their toys. Prevue Co. has been a favorite for 50 years, my first job 50 years ago was at a pet store so I do know which manufacturers have good products. I do recommend 2 people to put it together, the sections aren't marked and you need to be sure you can open all doors OUTWARD before you tighten everything. A screwdriver and a heavy pair of needlenose  pliers are all the tools required. The box has a pic of the cage and if you look at that, you can easily put it together. Within 2  hours of starting to work on it, it was together, I had it set up with litter, pouches, hammocks, food and the sugar gliders. EXCELLENT flight cage! We purchased this exact same cage this past summer and love it!  I decided to purchase a second for my daughter as she loved the first cage for her budgie and is adding a conure!  Imagine her disappointment when we put together the cage and it is markedly smaller than the first cage even though we ordered the exact same cage months earlier via amazon and the box shares the same dimensions:(  We are none too happy and really I can't understand why this would happen, yet she doesn't want to wait for another one to be shipped and hope that it is larger because the dimensions on the box are the exact same as the first cage:(  I will add pictures later to show the discrepancy:( It's huge!! Many people complained it was difficult to assemble...I don't understand why? My kids and I assembled it without even looking at the instructions. It took us about 20 mins. Just pay attention to the location of the holes and pins...they prevent you to make a mistake. If you have to use a drill...well then, you made a mistake :). (Being 2 people or more helps) This is a great value- would not be suitable for large birds (not strong enough) but it fits my (small) conure perfectly. UPDATE four years Later! 6-5-2020: My beloved sunny has since passed away from old age and prior health conditions, and it was very easy to disinfect and clean the cage for when I later adopted a little Green Cheek. No rust, still as awesome as the day I got it, springs are all still working just fine on the doors, etc! My Dad (owner of this account) bought this for my two male budgies. While I adore the cage itself, it has alot of room for them to fly, room for toys, etc, I have a few problems with it. Okay, this cage was a bit of a pain to put together and a small piece of the bottom tray was broken off in the box,but that was quickly taken care of and made right by Amazon (Love their customer service!).  As stated, the cage was a pain to put together, but it is so work it! It has so much room for my two budgies and they absolutely love it. I do too! I like the wheels and how it can be moved as needed.  It is very sturdy once its together. The two large front doors are nice and the lock is sturdy. I did clip all of the side doors. Although I don't think a budgie would be able to put them open, we do have two cats and I didn't want to chance them being able to open it. I have a male canary, 2 female canaries, 3 society finches and 2 fancy zebra finches. They are loving the room and a happy family. There are plenty of side doors ( 2 on each side), that make access to water and food dishes easy, plus the 2 large doors on the front. It was a nightmare to put together. The direction's are not clear and you have to look at the picture of it assembled to help you out. My husband is not one to swear, but as he was assembling this he swore like a sailor! I have added a couple extra real wood perches. I am not thrilled with the food dishes, because food gets thrown all over the floor. I am looking for a better solution to that. But over all this is a great cage, it's roomy and once together, is easy to move around and get into to clean. I would recommend. Bf and I bought the cage for a joey sugar glider, the boxed arrived super fast (we ordered on Monday midnight and arrived by Thursday) even thought we live in PR, which is mostly considered as international shipping.  It was well packaged, and at first I thought it didn't have instructions to assembly, but it had. The cage is pretty strong and has lots of space for the sugar to move and climb but since she is still a joey my bf had to line it with a metal mesh. She loves the wood perches and also likes to be in the food trays (sometimes she even falls asleep there, so we move her to her house). It has 8 doors so you can access the cage from many sides. I love it so much, I bought it twice! ", "For the price, this is a very nice cage. I was looking for something larger to house my 3 society finches, but I didn\u2019t want to spend a ton. This fit the bill. Is it the best cage ever? No. Is it worth the money? Definitely. It\u2019s sturdy enough to do the job. I do wish there was more space between the bottom shelf and the cage, because it\u2019s really not large enough to store many items. I also don\u2019t love the spring style doors on the sides of the cage (the front doors are fine). They just don\u2019t seem very secure for a large bird, so something to be aware of. But since I just have small finches, it\u2019s not a huge problem. You will definitely need two people to put this cage together (it is actually helpful to have 3 - this worked best for me). The instructions are clear, and it\u2019s not rocket science. It took about 35 minutes to put together. Upon receiving the time, it has a few things missing.  Sticks, metal stopper and screw for slide out rack at bottom and 3-4 side smaller swing doors won\u2019t stay close. Springs are bad/defective or ? I have five of these cages now and they are an excellent product for the money. My canary and I both adore this cage!  I wanted my little guy to have a bigger cage so he has room to fly around, and he seems so content in here. He's been singing like crazy ever since he moved in to his new mansion.  The cage is pretty easy to build, and I was able to do it myself. Do  follow the directions with building the cage though, as there are several pieces and if you put the bottom on backwards, for example, the tray won't fit properly. The  instructions are very clear, though, and I had no trouble with it. What happened here? Did all the inspectors, in whatever factory in China these cages are made, all quit? The wire grid for the bottom was not complete and the dishes, that were included for use with this cage, do not fit! We had previously purchased two (2) of these cages and were satisfied with their quality. Come on guys. My flock of budgies absolutely LOVE this mansion!  They have plenty of room to fly, jump around, swing from toys, run up tall ladders for exercise, best home for them!  The feeding trays that come with the home are awesome as well.  I would recommend securing the small swing out doors on the sides of the bird house just in case, since there is no latch for them.  Easy thing to do.  There is plenty of room to reach in and remove anything in the house through the two big doors on the front of the house.  Highly recommend this bird house, and for the price it's a steal!  :-)  I know your bird(s) will LOVE it like my flock does! Great cage overall. As others have said assembling it a bit of pain. I put it together by myself using a few lose zip ties to hold it up so it is possible but very close attention to the front pieces with the doors, only one has the holes on the bottom so if you do it wrong you have to undo it and swap em which is what i had to do unfortunately! I assumed the pieces were all made the same so it wouldn't matter but yeah was not the case. So word to the wise if you put this together. Otherwise it's pretty great, comes with lots of plastic bowls not seen in the picture and of course the perches. Floor is wire but i put cardboard on it since in this case i'm housing a small rooster where wire floor is not ideal. :) I bought this cage for my Green Cheek Conure, he loves it! It wasn\u2019t that hard to put together (I did it by myself in under an hour) but some of the pieces did have to be a little bent back? Some of the pegs that slide into the pieces to connect them didn\u2019t line up or were already bent but I just grabbed some pliers. I bought it cause I wanted him to have more room for more toys and activities while I\u2019m at work, and it\u2019s big enough for him! It\u2019s probably big enough for a pair of GCCs or even larger suns. I did not like the plastic food cups it came with though, he has dumped them and tossed them off about 5 times in the last couple days but I\u2019ve ordered other ones and am temporarily using his bolted bath bowl as a water bowl and only putting a small amount of food in the cups to reduce the waste. And the side doors are only held by springs so he can push them super easy, so I clipped them shut (which I had to do with his old cage anyways). Other than that it looks like a good affordable large home for him :) even though some of the pieces seemed to be a little off in measurements, there\u2019s still not any gaps large enough for him to get out. The tray lock is a plus, he loves pushing the trays out and play with with the paper :/. He likes how the bottom is low enough to terrorize the dogs they the cage bars and when they try to eat his pellets. The directions kinda sucked but definitely not the worst ever instructions. Comparable to like ikea style. It would probably be easier to use 2 people than 1, but I don\u2019t work well with others and it always ends in arguments lol so I did it by myself. Not very hard at all. The box was smaller than what I was expecting. I have a PO Box but it fit in the back of my Chevy Spark with no problem. Uhhh what else? Bird loves it, so I love it! Decent enough large cage without breaking the bank. Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I absolutely love this cage. My parakeets are very happy with plenty of room. It comes with two long perches and 4 double food and water bowls. Putting it together is much easier and quicker with help. Cage is very sturdy and I expect that it will hold up for a long time to come. Cleaning the cage is not the easiest. It is a larger cage so that is to be expected. 5-Star item, satisfied customer. I purchased the regular large cage to have another big home for my birds. When I started on the base, I thought it would be too small for a flight cage. ", "I was super leery about ordering this after reading all of the reviews but I have to say I am 100% satisfied and happy that I bought it. This cage is fantastic for the price. It was very easy to put together. I had no issues and no bent pieces. It did come with cheap wood perches and plastic feeding cups, two of which were broken but it's not a big deal. The assembly instructions were pretty bad but I figured it out. My 5 year old helped hold the pieces together while I assembled. It's an excellent buy for small birds. The couple things i don't like is the wires on the cage are vertical not horizontal and the side openings are spring loaded which i remedied with a few clothes pins. Overall it was worth it with the sheer size of the cage. Love this cage have an Indian Ringneck that is rescue and as you can see the smaller cages what she was in. In this cage she has lots room she is extremely happy! I've had the cage now for a few months and I'm so glad that I bought this one. Of course I did take the bottom grate out and move the tray to where the great was I'm not a fan of grates on the bottom and had seen for where another customer had done the same thing and it works out wonderful. I would highly recommend this cage. I found it very easy to put together. I was watching a movie and putting it together at the same time so it took about an hour. But I don't think I would put anything larger than possibly an Indian Ringneck in it I wouldn't go for any larger parrot. This cage is a good size and sturdy, but horribly made without precision.  The parts do now go where they should, wires were bent up upon arrival with some welds broken, leaving large gaps.  JB Weld was a good fix.  Buy it before you even receive your cage.  Also you need a hammer, pliers and 5 hours with lots of patience.  Throw away the wire door locks & devise your own.  The plastic food/water containers' grips don't fit thru the wire spaces, so throw them away. This is a great product. At this price point ($99 and free shipping), you will not find a better flight cage. It was well packaged, including corner supports/protectors, easy to unbox, and all parts were separately wrapped in plastic. The instructions were concise and easily understandable. I put this cage together by myself in less than 30 minutes. There were no missing or damaged parts. The front of the cage is attached last which allows you to place perches, feeding dishes, toys and arrange the interior to your liking without having to reach through doors and such. Once your interior decorating is complete you simply attach the front. I have three parakeets in it now with plenty of room and could probably add three more comfortably. Be forewarned though that this cage is not suitable for large, strong birds. A Macaw could destroy it easily, I suspect. But for parakeets, canaries and finches and such, it's perfect. I do take issue with the spring loaded doors on the side. For the sake of safety, I recommend you engineer a way to secure them. I did not remove a star since that issue is easily remedied if one chooses. Easy to assemble - did it alone as I had no helper. The x-large is really huge. Arrived well packaged and in sturdy box with bumpers on all corners. Getting the box inside was the hardest part it\u2019s very heavy and awkward. Beautiful build. Will be using for canaries and parakeets but I think it would house anything up to and including an Indian ringneck if you fastened down the size spring doors. The two front doors are big enough to admit a good sized conure orvIRN and it\u2019s sturdy. Would never put an amazon or grey in it they would just bend the bars. This is just a huge bargain and I appreciate that it\u2019s not overly heavy to move about. Great Great Great. Love it! We purchased this for Quinn after adopting our husky mix. He enjoys flying around but since we got her we don\u2019t risk them in the same room without supervision. When he is out they are in separate rooms as-like any husky-she takes a little too much interest. He has so much space! The smaller sized one with the wheels makes it easy to roll into and out of the closet when we move him from his bedtime cage to this-the play time one. Assembly was a little difficult due to manufacture blemishes. There was one hole with a large metal bump inside that hadn\u2019t been filed down during manufacture. It made it impossible to put the back piece in the hole. Thankfully I had a spare knife sharpener that did the trick. My Quinn approves so it was worth it! He is quite thoroughly spoiled with this. I\u2019d definitely use it for birds like parakeets, cockatiels, canaries, and finches. Maybe parrotlets too but anything larger such as a conure may be able to chew through the bars if they really put their mind to it. The sliding tray makes cleaning easy along with the double doors, and the extra slot below that has been great for storing food, toys, and newspapers. All in all it\u2019s great! After reading reviews for this product, I made the purchase expecting to spend hours putting it together. I also expected missing or broken pieces. Not only were all of the pieces in perfect condition, the entire cage only took me 30 minutes to put together. The instructions were easy to follow, despite the parts not being labelled. You have to look at the pictures on the instructions to figure out which pieces go where, but this is DEFINITELY worth the money. I have a Plum Headed Parrot, and he loves it! I wouldn't recommend this for large parrots, as their beaks are likely strong enough to bite through, or bend, the thin bars. However, this cage is PERFECT for small to medium sized birds. My birds seem to like their new home, personally I love it, for the price it is strong, durable and huge compared to the one we upgraded from, they spent the first 3 days literally in one spot and didn't move until they realized there were other dishes in there with food and treats... I absolutely love this cage, It is huge, my boys can easily fly back and forth together and they have lots of room to separate if they are moody, as for the ease of putting it together....SO EASY I did it myself, I was worried because I read others reviews on it saying they had trouble, but please don't let that discourage you from buying, I don't understand their complaint because all the sections are clearly different so if you just follow the instructions..even just the pictures you can do it...and I did it all myself..only took me about 45 minutes...we are so happy with it...in the first picture you can see the smaller flight cage my two boys were in which I know was sufficient but this one is sooooo much more roomy ...hope I have helped you decide to buy ....happy chirping :) ", "The parts on the instructions are labeled L1 L2 R1 R2 etc. The problem is, is the parts themselves are not labeled at all (if they are it's extremely poorly). Seriously, at least IKEA has that part down. This company? NOPE. The packages which the parts came in were not labeled either. Which wouldn't have mattered anyhow since some of them were outside of the plastic. Like the employee that put the parts together in the box just simply could not be bothered with the extra step. The instruction paper gives a description on what each part looks like. Sounds acceptable right? NOPE again! Each part is literally identical to it's counterpart if you were to flip it to the other side. Making their descriptions completely worthless. My budgies love their new cage. There is plenty of room for them to flitter around and play. Lots of room for toys and stuff too. Between the reviews here, plus feedback from a Parakeet group I administer on Facebook, comments on this cage have three consistent themes:  a part arrived damaged, it's difficult to assemble and the purchaser wouldn't hesitate to buy the cage again.  Consider this one more of the same. We ordered the extra large size (measurements given in the description are for the extra large, but the price is for the smaller cage.  Be sure to select the extra large if you are looking for a cage with the largest dimensions given.) and our birds LOVE it!  We have 5 parakeets who were previously in two smaller cages.  The three that were in one of those cages were squabbling and picking at each other, even though the cage is one of the largest non-flight cages available.  In this extra large flight cage, all five birds are happy together and there is plenty of room for the birds and their toys.  Giving the cage a 4 star instead of 5, as there were a couple of rough places we needed to smooth off with a Dremel.  But once that was done, we have been thrilled with the cage.  It is a little tricky to assemble, being so large, but using some zip ties and two people, it was not a challenge.  Highly recommended by our birds!  They have never been happier! initially I was going through setting it up fairly quick until there was a piece that didn't fit completely, it took a lot of effort for me to force it to fit. They do have a 90 day policy where you can receive a new part instead of returning everything but I didn't and just forced the parts together hopefully that doesn't cause problems down the road but otherwise it seems to be a decent cage and I think my conure is happy in all that space. My Cockatiel loves this palace. it did take her about 2-3 days to really start to get comfortable. HUGE is an understatement. I have to get her a mate now. The cage was fairly easy to assemble by myself, the sole issue being some panels were slightly bent but with manipulation they worked just fine and nestled into place. Birds are very intelligent and easily become depressed.  This is a HUGE cage that allows birds like finches and parakeets plenty of room to fly and play.  Flight is important for a birds mental health as well as physical health. Who made this? Someone with no hands/eyes? Awful. Parts missing, broken pieces, and warped metal/iron. Horrible manufacturing. Bad for birds. Company is going downhill :( I love most of this cage, but I had a mother and two baby parakeets, The bottom tray got knocked out (barley enough room from it to stay in place) and my birds got out and my dog killed them. I was so upset. ", "I am going to make a video review of this cage because I got it recently and already love it to pieces! I can name dozens upon dozens of reasons why it was an awesome choice, even beyond what I considered at the time of purchase. Since there are so few flaws/challenges I'll name those instead for now: 1) It says you need a partner to set it up. I didn't because I'm fierce. 2) Don't screw the bolts too tight or it warps the corners and creates cracks. 3) In spite of clear instructions I \"intuitively\" put the front pieces on in reverse. 4) The bowls are lame and they don't fit where they say they are supposed to go. They fit great on the box though, the lid of which I use as a foraging tray. 5) The lock on the grate at the bottom is annoying but removable and doesn't block the poop tray, only the grate over it. 6) You need to do some light engineering if you want to use the cage without the grate because it leaves too big a gap between the wall and the tray. 7) There is a lip on the inside left and right which collects poop (mostly from my tiel, not my keet, because he perches on the edge of the top of the cage). 8) The bars are very soft feeling, even compared to my cheap petstore cages. Not a problem for budgies and makes the cage light and easy to handle for the size. 9) The many side doors are spring loaded and don't have any kind of latch, not that it is an issue for me. 10) The bars are mostly vertical which is lame since birds prefer horizontal for climbing, but it is good for viewing and my birds climb fine on it just the same. P.S. Did you notice the 5 stars? I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I tell so many people to buy this cage that I should be given some kind of rebate by Prevue, hah. Both my birds and I love the cage, especially all the doors. I was a bit nervous about buying the cage after reading some of the reviews but I guess I was lucky. It arrived on time, all the pieces were there and undamaged. I lined up all the pieces and assembled it. It took me a little longer because I assembled it by myself and I\u2019m in a wheelchair paralyzed from the waist down. The second person helping was a pair of vice grips and string to hold up a side or two. It\u2019s still standing strong after a year or so. I even built a 2 \u00bd\u2019 high dowel rod jungle gym set the full size of the top. I will agree with everyone\u2019s comments about the wheels, the company could have invested a little more on the wheels Very nice cage.  2 people needed to assemble.  Nothing bent or broken, packaging was reinforced and I think that problem has been fixed since other posts.  Perches are very large, more cockateil than parakeet size.  Only thing I would mention about assembly:  make sure the base orientation is correct for insertion of bottom tray before building the cage and i would do left bottom, right bottom, back loosly screwed instead of left bottom and top, right bottom and top and back stacked.  Seriously, it's like Jenga the direction way or a crazy game of twister (left hand blue). It\u2019s advertised as suitable for parakeets but there are some pretty big gaps where the sections go together. I used zip ties to help hold the panels sections together, they didn\u2019t seem terribly sturdy. The coating was chipped off one corner of cage and metal underneath was a little rusty. Box was in bad shape on arrival but all prices were there.  I put it together by myself, took a couple hours. Instructions were ok, parts could have been labeled would have made it easier. LOVE IT -- BUY THIS! yes, was difficult to assemble, and one of the bars along the bottom had to be drilled in two places to receive one of the panels, but was SO worth it. took two of us about an hour or more to put together. I looked at a lot of cages in deciding what to get.  My birds and I both really love this cage. This is just the right size, big without overtaking the room it's in.  I have a couple parakeets in it and they love that there is room to actually fly from place to place.  Also plenty of room to add some natural branches and some toys and not clog up the flying space.  The small doors on the sides are a nice plus, easy to reach in to take care of food/water or toys without opening a big door.  Though I do wish the small doors had clips instead of just being spring loaded.  A larger bird wouldn't have much trouble learning to open them.  Nice sturdy cage on wheels, easy to move about the house if I want to.  Very happy with this purchase. Great cage! I needed something large because my flock grew from 2 parakeets to 4. They have do much room now, and are able to exercise their wings when they can't be out of the cage. The tray did arrive damaged, but I contacted Prevue, gave them some information, and they sent out a new tray right away. I always appreciate great customer service! I adopted a lost parakeet by accident, and had no idea what I was doing at first - my vet had to set me straight about appropriate cage size. These cages are large enough to meet most SPCA cage size standards, especially the extra large. They aren't perfect - assembly DEFINITELY takes two people, and if you've got an adventurous bird that tends to hop into doorways you should secure the tension-spring side doors with carabiners to avoid the risk of injury. Still, I'm giving this 5 stars for making an appropriately large cage affordable for those of us who are bird owners on a budget - I didn't find anything else that was as good for the money. This is also very sturdy - I have absolutely no concerns about sides unclipping, bottoms falling out, etc. Cleaning is also super easy via the pull-out tray and bottom grate. I've bought two of these cages now.  You can't beat the quality, size, for the price.  With the help of a few bread-ties strategically placed, I was able to assemble both cages by myself with very little stress. Read a lot of negative reviews, but couldn't pass up on the price and had to try it .. so glad I did! It didn't take too long to put together once I got the hang of it. While it had all the pieces, one of the food dishes was broken, but I really had no use for four anyway. It's so spacious and allows my glider to do his thing. Super satisfiedddd! ", "I have a rescued squirrel and this cage is perfect for him. I was afraid it was going to be cheap and flimsy but I was happily surprised. I set this up on my own in about half an hour roughly. Having two people would have been a lot easier but it can be done with only one person. The instructions were okay. I followed the pictures to make sure I was using the right parts in the right spots. I love that the bottom tray just slides out for cleaning as well as the bottom grate. I can also roll the whole cage outside when I need to clean and so the squirrel can have some fresh air and sunshine. I used zip ties to close the doors I don't use and there are plenty. 3 small doors on each side and 2 large doors on the front. Once you have it together, I think you will be very pleased. My cockatiel, Flipper, loves his new large home. He had originally lived his entire life in a small cage we got from his previous owner, but we decided to splurge and get him this cage so he could have more room to roam when we weren't home. Only minor downside is I always forget to close the bottom door when leaving for work so my father comes home and finds the bird on top of the cage with the top door closed and the bottom door open. It also rolls quite easily and cleans even easier. Assembly definitely needs 2 people because you need someone to balance a piece while the other screws it in. Warning: Inquisitive birds WILL investigate their snack supply on the shelf on the bottom and/or investigate the floor underneath. Also do not know what the small doors on the side are for. We use them to sneak treats to him while he thinks the door is closed. This is an excellent cage.  I'm very happy with this purchase. This thing is awesome! Firstly, I didnt know it came with three perches and four HUGE water and food dishes. That was a nice addition. Right now I have only have two finches inside. Super easy to assemble! Took me about 30 minutes but I kept stopping to focus on my tv show every once in awhile. Doing the top part was the hardest, because you had to get everything to align just right. I'm already thinking of buying another one! It did come bent on the top panel, like other people have mentioned. Honestly, given the super low price I cant complain. It was an easy fix, I just put a piece of wood to cover the top. My birds love this cage, which is roomy, and now filled with toys and natural branches and vines that provide some shock absorption when they land after a short flight. It took 2 of us 1 hour to put the cage together. Nice and spacious. However, after 6 months my green cheek conure has figured out how to open the 5 spring-loaded doors. Which would be ok, if he could figure out how to get back in, and if we didn't have a very stealthy and playful cat. I was amazed when my kids told me that the bird was out of his cage twice today, even though all of the primary gates and latches were secured. The side doors, intended primarily for the convenience of adding or changing food or water, are spring-loaded and don't mechanically latch. They rely on the spring pressure to keep closed. The spring pressure is light, not enough to prevent a bird from opening. What my conure does is forces the door open with his beak, then pushes his body through which keeps it open as he exits. I rarely ever leave feedback although we buy from Amazon several times a month.  I felt like this was the type of item to leave feedback for!  If you order this same cage from Pet Co or Pet Smart you will be close to or even over $400 once you include tax and shipping.  We bought the XL version througg Prime and got it today. It's sturdy, easy to put together, and huge! If you're looking for a great deal this is it. \u263a Overhaul I like the cage.  It\u2019s Sturdy and very large.  I gave it 3 stars for the following: I wish this product had bigger doors - I am using it for rats. It's amazing value per square inch - but the doors are small enough that it makes setting the enclosure up a slightly more challenging task than some of the comparable cages. Overall, though, this arrived without significant damage (two bent bars, easy to mostly straighten, one broken food dish). Overall, I like it so far. Assembly took me about an hour while being exceptionally tired and already slowing down for the day - easy enough assembly. It's handy to have someone taller if possible help to assemble. I'm fairly average (5'4\") and it had to be amusing to watch me try to attach the top of the cage. I would not home anything larger than a GCC, but this is a great home. If you're looking for something cheap but good enough, this is one step further. At the price of a cheap cage at a pet store, you get a massive home. The minimum space for a GCC is 20\"x 20\" x20\", so you're providing a great space. The tray makes cleaning easier, and Ria loves it. There is a little door that makes it easy to feed her or pour water. If you're debating on a temporary cheap cage for a large bird (nothing bigger than a large conure!) this is okay, and more preferable than a small similar quality cage. Another reason why you wouldn't want to house a larger parrot Here is because of the doors that will open if a bird strong enough tries. The reason why no larger birds is because of the spacing for their feet and the thin bars becoming vulnerable to beaks designed to break hard material. ", "I ordered the Large cage and it just came in today. I finished assembling it on my own about a hour ago, and my 3 parakeets love it! The cage was difficult to assemble on my own but instructions weren't bad if you are good at following pictures. The most annoying thing was the metal pegs would pop out on me when I tried  to line parts up to put in screws. I was one of the lucky ones, mine didn't come with burs, bent bars, missing or duplicate parts, or screw holes that didn't align or missing all together. Mine cage with four plastic bowls not sure  but thought it was only supposed to be 2 but no complaining! Like every one else I zip tied the side doors permanently shut. So far no complaints! Only worried about possible rusting down the road. I debated on buying this cage for a while because of negative reviews and all that... First off I just want to say it was extremely easy to build... compared to gym equipment, smokers, furniture and more, this was a breeze to put together. 6 simple steps and I was done! Small details I would suggest is have a needle nose plier handy(it'll say in the instructions), and be prepared to make a couple small changes due to shipping bending a couple (1 or 2) metal frames. They also give you a extra screw or 2 just in case 1 was faulty or you lose one somehow. There isn't many pieces so again, putting it together was a breeze(did it in an hour by myself). I give this cage an overall 4 because the doors are pretty lame, I would of preferred bigger doors on the front and for the side ones to at least latch or stick, but they are spring loaded, meaning my bird could escape or worse. Otherwise solid cage if you can't afford anything bigger and better.. also Pravue has a bunch of easy assessories made just for it! Normally I'd give a full five stars, but here's the thing. The item name says it's wrought iron, but last time I bought a wrought iron cage, bending the bars was just a biiiiit of a challenge. This cage came with pre-bent bars which I easily bent back into place. My budgies love it, but is it *really* wrought iron? This is doing it's job, but it's weird. One of the doors came with a guiding clip already broken off of it, so we almost never touch that door to open it. One of the holes to secure the top half of the cage was also bent in to prevent the top section from connecting to the bottom section. I had to use pliers to widen the hole so it could actually fit. This has survived the test of time.  I bought 2 social finches, and in less than 2 years, I have 10......and am now tossing the eggs or i would have 100.  This is still OK for size and the tray and bottom removable floor makes it easy to clean. The wheels make it each to move for cleaning, or the seasons.  In summer it sits by the window, but because of the location of the heating, I can't leave it there in winter.  I bought it because of the wheels, but now that I know how social the finches are, I'm glad I have it for the size!  I recommend 2 people to assemble it, but we didn't have any problems. I purchased this cage for my Borke Grasskeets. It does require assembly when it arrives and I left that to my husband. It would take 2 people or one very savvy person with longer arms to assemble on their own. ***WARNING: This cage's spring loaded feeding doors led to the death of a young parakeet who I'm guessing got caught in there and panicked. I found her hanging there with her head stuck. WIRE THEM SHUT!*** I personally assembled this by myself, though some parts were a tad difficult it was certainly manageable. I finally purchased this cage after reading recommendation after recommendation for it on the different budgie groups I am part of, and it doesn't disappoint. It gives my 4 budgies plenty of room to fly and get away from each other when they want to. My only recommendation is to make sure you clip the different doors closed as my budgies have been able to figure out how to open them and get out. Overall, fantastic product that I will recommend to all budgie owners I run into. This is a really nice cage. At first it looked a little flimsy but as soon as you put it together it is wonderful.  I was using a dog crate and it was hard to clean this will be a breeze. One of the dishes clip was broken but I found the part and glued it but it comes with 4 large dishes so it will be fine. My birds look so small in the cage which makes me happy it means they now have plenty of room.  I have 4 parakeets ind it's fine. I almost bought 2 and put them together which you can do but 1 is fine unless they have babies. Great cage for the price.  I'd actually give it 4.5 stars.  The instructions are ok.  They were a bit useless since the items in the pictures are too small to discern and none of the parts are labeled.  We used common sense and put the pieces in order (or at least what we assumed the correct piece was).  You will definitely need two people to put it together since all the sides need be aligned and held into place while putting this up. None ", "I was a little nervous about some of the reviews concerning missing or damaged parts and difficulties with assembly, but everything arrived in great condition and I easily and quickly assembled the cage by myself. I love this cage for its huge size, multiple doors on 3 sides for easy access, and slide out bottom grill and tray. I have one lovebird and there is no reason for any other cage in my case. So happy my bird has so much space and the cage is of a highly suitable quality for one small bird-just like advertised. The feeding cups are flimsy plastic will need to be replaced with better equipmemt in time but are functional for now and not important to the over all benefits of the cage. It arrived with one broken door lock and two broken feeders. Sad. Took two people to put together. Now we\u2019ve been using it for a while. The cage itself is sturdy. The wheels are sturdier than another Prevue cage we owned for years. The biggest pain is the plastic tray shrank after the first week of use, making us spend 10, 15 minutes to put it back after cleaning each time. The worse part is the loud falling noise scares the bird easily. When we are cleaning the grid, we are constantly worried about the tray falling out to let the bird out. The metal \u201cPrevue\u201d tag in the front is also unnecessary since it gets stuck in the grid all the time when you slide the grid in and out. The Amazon price for this cage is about half of where sold elsewhere.  The only drawback, is that I couldn't assemble it alone.  It is sturdy, and on my hard floors it is simple to roll around to clean underneath, place beside me at my desk, in and out of the sun, etc.  The global, high-quality wheels roll with esae.  Using zip ties, my surprisingly strong parrotlet has no chance of escape.  Zip ties can be removed quickly using side cutters.  American parakeets wouldn't be able to open these spring doors, most likely.  It has two small spring doors on the side and two 10 x 10\" latched doors on the front.  I recommend this cage with five big fat stars.  All parts arrived in pristine condition, undamaged.  . My two diamond doves love their new cage. I got the large size and it\u2019s plenty large for them. They primarily stay at the top because it\u2019s in front of the window and their swing and bridge are up there. But they do fly down to the bottom and perch to perch once in awhile. The cage was a pain to put together with 2 people because one side would keep popping out while you were doing the other side. Once the cage was set up though I was happy and so were my doves. They don\u2019t beg to come out of their cage all the time now since it\u2019s so much bigger. I don\u2019t use the grate on the bottom. I think only the tray is necessary. For 153. I was expecting more. The box came with several holes in it, there were bent wires in 5 places. The instructions are light grey with miniature part pics, and none of the panels are labelled. Sure I figured it out, but it took a while to identify different parts. Be careful, \"wrought iron\" is not really what we're dealing with here. Metal is quite soft and it's easy to strip the bolts if you tighten too much. The cage is sturdy, larger than expected and good.  However, I am using it for sugar gliders and it wasn\u2019t until I received the cage and transferred the critters that I realized the bars being predominantly horizontal would have been better for them.  We received the plastic floor tray cracked and have yet to hear back from customer service of Prevue Hendrix.  Amazon redirects us to them.  I don\u2019t want to send the whole thing back, but I also don\u2019t want a broken item, that I paid almost $200 for. Very poor customer service.  If you buy, cross your fingers that it comes to you in good condition.  Better yet, if buying for gliders, go with a DCN or a cage from Exotic Nutrition. We added three house sparrows to the family this summer.  They'd come in for rehabilitation, and weren't quite releasable, but too lively and cheerful and just plain full of beans to kill.  So they stayed.  We let them fly free in the house except at night, but the poop was an issue, so we needed a nice cage with lots of room for flying.  We needed to do it on a budget.  This cage is just shy of 18 cubic feet.  Comparably sized flight cages usually cost twice the price. I'm very pleased with this cage. Its the perfect size for my 5 cockatiels. I said I'd never purchase a cage w/vertical bars but I'm glad I tried it. Even though my tiels prefer the horizontal bars, they dont mind these bars. They still manage to get around just fine. One of my birds has a handicap (right foot is turned to side), as a result of momma being to big when sitting on him, and he gets around fine as well. I DID add a few perches to give them more options.  It was fairly easy to put together. Sometimes it took 3 ppl. And at 1 point, I had to take the whole top off and flip it around bcuz the back was in the front lol. Yes, this cage is very spacious and priced reasonably, but I found it very difficult to assemble. I was looking for a flight cage for my juvenile parakeet.  This was a brand new in the box, Prevue cage made in China.  It's powder coated \"antique silver\" (silver and black mottled finish, currently pretty stylish) not the wrought iron listed in the description (since wrought iron isn't made any longer pretty much at all let alone in China).  It was well packed but, unfortunately, somehow the very top front and back piece had the paint rubbed and it's a bit unsightly.  The cage was definitely a 2 person job to put together.  The instructions aren't great - mostly because the pictures are soooo tiny you can't possibly figure out which piece is which based upon those.  We knew just because we already have 4 bird cages and have put together our fair share of cheap furniture before.  We'd get 2 pieces put together, start on the next 2 and the first set would start coming out (you can't tighten everything until later because you can't fit later pieces in...)  We finally got smart enough to start putting zip ties on to hold pieces in place so they wouldn't slip out before we tightened bolts.  I strongly recommend this to anyone trying to put it together. ", "I have some expensive cages that are heavy and durable. They were also $500. This cage is \"flimsy\" compared to these...but I realize now that my small parrots don't need heavy duty cages so long as the metal is safe (it is) and they can't escape (they can't). This cage is an affordable breath of fresh air - literally! It lets light in, is more versatile, and is more \"climbable\" than our posh cages. A strong recommend.  Arrived on time, no damage, easy assembly. I had my doubts after reading other reviews.. I was so pleasantly surprised by this cage for my canary! He is singing right now and has room to fly. I am 72 and put it together by myself.  The directions were very clear It's a very good cage for the price! I got an XL and it's as described... Plus it has wheels! I didn't know that when I bought it! She has 3 of them. One of these cages are the perfect size for a cockatiel. She uses one for outside in the summer, one as a cockatiel cage and one for her budgie. She has also put 2 cages back to back for use as one big cage. However there is a slight quality difference between each cage she has, she has 2 of the brand name prevue cages and a different brand she can't identity that she received form this listing where she got the first cage. The second (not prevue) cage is still ok. The third cage she got recently is of the prevue brand like the first cage she bought. I usually don't post any recommendations but felt I needed to. This cage is fantastic. It's huge but sturdy. I have one male love bird and he can fly in here. Plenty of room for his toys. Feeding cups and perches were in excellent condition and all holes were drilled correctly. As previously stated by others, the smaller doors are not very secure if you have a bird who is adamant on getting out. Twist ties worked fine on keeping him in the cage. Overall you are paying for what you get. As other reviews have said this product comes with terrible directions. However with common sense, the cage is easily put together. Also, referring to other reviews, there is a good chance something will be bent out of shape or broken when you get it. My particular cage had 1 bent bar, a chipped trey (around the rim, still usable), and the lock on one door was installed wrong (Can still be opened). Overall these are not huge problems. Ok i got this large cage its for my Alexandrine parakeet. She loves it. very spacious she moves around the cage with no problem. Instructions are very simple but do recommend two people for a job. Cage is strong for the price. Easy to clean bottom tray slides out. Does come with wheels but did not install them. Has 3 small doors on right side and left side of the cage 2 door's on top and 1 on the bottom. Also Has two big doors on front of the cage. Comes with 4 trays for food and 3 wooden sticks for birds to sit on. Do recommend buying plastic because my parakeet loves biting wooden sticks. Over all very happy with the product. We bought this for our two Australian Budgerigars (larger than parakeets, smaller than Cockatiels) .  We call it the \"Play Pen\" because they have plenty of room to do so.  We wanted lots of room for toys and ladders etc.  This cage is solid but not excessively heavy; it rolls easily on four wheels. Lots of opening  doors on front and sides but none on the back.  I can easily work around that but it would have been nice to have.  There is a nice debris  catching tray at the bottom that slides out for easy removal to clean.  Tip: I buy a big roll of white freezer paper at Costco and tear off sheet to place on the tray.  It fits perfectly, is inexpensive and makes cage cleaning a snap. I bought this flight cage and it was delivered to our home within 3 business days in a heavy cardboard box. This cage has to be assembled. In reading the instructions for assembly which was on one page on the front and back, it became clear to me that this would take a little longer to assemble. The pictures on the directions of each step could have been much larger to read and see. You need to make sure that you put the cage sides together correctly and line them up properly before tightening the screws. We found out the hard way with 1 or 2 of the cages that were not fully lined up before the screws were tightened.  I also found out that you need an extra person or two to hold the sides of the cages while you put in the screws with the Allen wrench. It took about 35-45 minutes to assemble the cage which was not too bad I thought. I purchased this cage because I wanted to encourage my \u201cclipped\u201d green cheeked conure to fly. She is doing just that. The cage is well suited as a flight cage and holds lots of entertaining toys. ", "Yes this is a great price for a bird cage  ..It arrived on time  and the box was pretty heavy it actually has a sticker that says  HEAVY.  Opened it and found all the screws thrown throughout the box.  So i was hopeful they all were there, and they were. Much to my surprize it is grey and black speckled...not solid black.  That was ok but disappointing.  Then started to assemble it and none of the pieces were marked.  Yes it took a while but we figured it out.  Would have been so much easier to have the pieces marked.  Be aware....when it says in small print  requires 2 people to assemble it they are not kidding.  Its flimsy to assemble and the alan wrench is always a challenge.  The cage is not that sturdy, I have a few Flight cages and they are strong, this one is not.  I dont like the doors they are spring closing NOT LATCHING  and the spring is like a feather  in resistance. Iam going to need to figure out a latch for  each of the 8 doors.  The perches which came with it...are not for Parakeets...they are too thick...so that was sad too.  You get what you pay for...thats for sure.... The cage, once put together is great! The problem is the directions. In particular, the simple fact that the directions have labels for each piece, but there's no indication on the pieces themselves as to which piece they are. Labeles would have made assembly MUCH easier. It's for this reason, I have to give it three stars. HOWEVER, it's a solid product. It arrived with no damage. It was packed well and my two parakeets seem much happier with the larger space. This cage is great! Good quality and materials. Took us about an hour to put together. We have ringneck doves in this cage and it is the perfect size (our doves do get daily flight time each day). It even has room for the custom nesting box that we built. The food/water dishes are definitely more for smaller birds such as parakeets or finches so we ended up replacing those but that was to be expected. Our doves are very happy. The bars are on the thinner side so I wouldn't recommend for a heavy chewer or parrot type of bird as I feel as they could easily bend/break the bars. Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase! I use the bowls it came was as water bowls, but my budgies can\u2019t reach the perch so they sit on the rim of the bowl and drink from there. Problem is, if they turn around while sitting on the rim, which they do very often, they end up pooping in the water. And sometimes they sleep on the bowl, and they all sleep together so they\u2019ll be 6 budgie morning poops in the water. But again, easy fix, I\u2019ll be getting different water bowls. It\u2019s a little smaller than expected, I thought about returning it and getting an extra large but my birds took to this cage right away. Some of them are still skittish/not tame and this quickly became their \u201csafe space\u201d, and stay calm even for the few hours a day when all the doors are open for them to fly around. Good cage overall A lot of people warned me that my conure may bend these bars or that the cage was cheaply made but I am very happy with it. It is very big and roomy for him so I do not feel guilty if I have to leave him in the cage if I have to go out somewhere. I\u2019ve had no issues with him bending the bars at all. The assembly is kind of a pain if you are doing it alone but other than that, once it\u2019s assembled it\u2019s very easy to clean and maneuver. I love it. This cage is awesome! I have 3 parakeets and they are enjoying the massive flying room. At first they were sitting on the top perch looking up and down the cage.  They seemed unsure at first.  But now they are happily fluttering around the cage. We had our parakeets in two separate cages that were made of thin wires. I adopted a cat who took great interest in the birds, so I got this cage. It is the exact sturdiness I was looking for. Easy to piece together myself. The litter pan is super easy to remove for cleaning, but also stays in place when moving the cage. I ziptied a few of the doors shut and put clips on the ones I would be using. No other modifications were necessary to keep my birds safe. My cat has latched onto the side of the cage, climbed it, and sat on top of it with no harm at all to the birds (they are super chill and accustomed to the busy household) or the cage. 4 parakeets (budgies) are in the cage with plenty of toys and they still have room to fly around. Pretty easy to put up. I bought this for my caique. It gives him plenty of space to move around and hang all of his toys. He is pretty smart and has figured out how to open the side doors that do not have locks. So I would say to find a way to lock those side doors if you have a bird who is good at figuring out how to escape. It is cheap metal in my opinion. But decently sturdy. For the space he gets and how easy it is to put together, it is a pretty great buy for the price. I do wish the space under the bottom tray was a bit taller to store his bags of foods and snacks easier. This is a fantastic cage! I put it together quickly and easily but myself with a toddler \"helping\". I believe some of the reviews are for an older build. This on takes only 12 1.5\" screws and is very simple to assemble. All the pieces fit perfectly. The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me is because the side pieces are identical so when assembled the crossbars are on the inside but out on the other and the nesting box doors open from the opposite direction. But its certainly not a deal breaker and you cant beat the price. It's a huge cage with smaller bar spacing that will give my parrotlet a lot of room. This cage is built really well! putting it together was really easy (hint: don't tighten any of the screws until your done with the assembly). After 2 weeks in the cage, my two parakeets are now flying in it. This cage is nice and huge for these small birds. I'll probably by another to get store-bought parakeets ready and able to fly in my large aviary without living on the ground until their clipped wings grow back. ", "So the cage is nice, it\u2019s plenty spacious for my two parakeets and there\u2019s lots of room for toys. The wheels are great and it was fairly easy to put together, it says it requires two people but I did it alone no problem. However, two of the bars were not secure so I had to secure it myself because it made the space big enough for a bird just to wiggle right through, also I received duplicate panels for the back side (rather than top/bottom, I got top/top) instead of making a fuss about it I just secured these panels together in the middle with zip ties and it works just fine. I think the low price of such a spacious cage makes up for the discrepancies, I would overall recommend just beware it might not be perfect based on my experience and other reviews. I wanted the largest bird cage I could afford.  I decided to purchase this one based on the size, the price, and the high number of positive reviews.  The additional customer photos were also very helpful. I bought this cage a little under 2 years ago for a group of rats. I had to modify it by adding shelves and ramps for the rats, but this was easy to do. The spring doors on the sides are handy but rats can of course push their way right out, but I bought tiny heart locks on Amazon also that keep them shut and are kinda cute :) I love how I can pull the grate and tray out to wipe them down, and the bars havent rusted even with rat pee all over them(much worse than birds lol). The trays and ramps have had to be replaced several times, but this cage could last forever. It is also very large, and the perches are sturdy if you want a large bird sitting on them. I would definitely recommend it. I initially purchased one wrought iron flight cage. It arrived right on time, securely packaged. All pieces were included and there was no damage. The instructions were easy to follow and I had the cage assembled  by myself in a short time. I still cannot believe how sturdy and well made this cage is for the price! In fact I was so impressed I bought two more! I use them to house my zebra and society finches. The birds have a lot of space  and the feather pulling and fighting over perch space is totally gone. The birds are happy and so am I. I recommend this cage to anyone wanting a nice piece of furniture to show off their birds. We used this cage for our ringneck doves and they love it! It has tons of space for them and they are quite big. The assembly was a bit hard and it definitely helps to have someone to help you. We actually couldn't get the top piece completely secured to the sides but it still worked out okay. Once it is assembled, it is very sturdy, and comes with four water and food containers. Great cage! I love this cage so far!! It was fairly simple to put together and my 4 parakeets LOVE IT!! They seem to fly way better in this cage. They love flying and playing on their toys. I feel like the other small cages they had were too small. This is a nice LARGE cage. The side doors do not latch shut, they are on a spring and swing shut if you are afraid your bird may figure out how to open the doors and do not want that to happen,  you could put a zip tie on it black is almost unnoticeable Well if you decide to purchase this product grab a friend that to help you assemble it it's always nice to have extra hands to hold panels while you install. Firstly I live this cage it is beautiful and my tiels have loads of space , it\u2019s easy to clean and convenient to move and clean behind HOWEVER, assembling wasn\u2019t easy because in the manual the pieces where labelled R1 L1 R2L2 ok fine but there was no way to tell which piece was which so it\u2019s very easy to assemble it incorrectly and realize that almost at the end. My other issue is that a few bars where bent and out of shape such as the door on the top was bent enough that my bird almost escaped and bending it back is not easy , bars on the side and bottom are bent also and can\u2019t be moved back as the metal is very strong , over all tho it\u2019s a beautiful cage worth the hassle but a discount for bend and misshapen bars should of been issued This is a very well made cage for the price. Much easier to put together with 2 people, but can definitely be done alone. Although some people have said this wouldn\u2019t work for a medium sized parrot, I bought this as a second cage for our eclectus and they love it. Parrot is out of cage most of the day and can go in or out as they please, so that might be a factor in whether this would work for you. Have had no problems with the cage and would definitely purchase again. Great cage and a great value. It arrived damaged though but that's obviously not the seller's fault. The bottom tray came cracked but I needed it right away so I kept it. I didnt want to send back the whole cage just for that. This is a fantastic cage though so large and has doors all over the close automatically on a spring for safety. Defintly cat proof which really helps in my house. Really love this cage and so does my dove, I'll be buying another one soon and hopefully UPS can manage to deliver it without breaking it this time. Its packaged well so it mustve been roughed up in delivery. ", "I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about this cage after it was built for my two cockatiels, but it is working out nicely. All parts arrived in good shape, and my partner (who is quite good a following instructions) was able to build it easily. We did have a small issue when we had to re-position one side that wasn't aligned correctly after we built the cage. The screws the cage came with quickly became stripped, so it is clear that the hardware that came with the cage isn't the best quality (thus, the 4 stars). That said, once the cage building process was complete it seemed sturdy and our birds are most content! If your cockatiels are like mine and prefer chilling at the top of the cage, this will be a nice home for about 4 cockatiels. It's also a great cage for budgies or other small birds that won't do damage to the metal bars with their beaks (also not a good choice for birds who easily escape because there are several small doors along the sides of the cage that are spring-loaded and thus can be pushed open). There also isn't a real great barrier of any sort around the bottom of the cage, so you may need to purchase a seed net to avoid a mess. I'm happy with the cage and my cockatiels are enjoying their new home. We may even add a new cockatiel friend since we have the space! I've had this cage set up for about a month now and have nothing but good things to say about it.  The thing is a great size and comes with a handful of bowls and perches to get you started.  You definitely have a ton of room to add other things to keep your bird(s) active and playing.  There are several doors on both sides and 2 main larger doors on the front.  The front ones latch whereas the side ones kind snap shut.  It's been very easy to clean and it has wheels that allow for mobility. I purchased the regular size. Great cage for budgies. Wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold up against anything bigger than a cockatiel. Amazing flight cage for the price. You can assemble it by yourself if you are super handy and patient. However, you will most likely want to have a friend to help you for some of the steps. It is by no means exemplary in terms of sturdiness or it\u2019s design. But it is definitely great for the price, many similar sized cages can go for up to $400 or more. t will work great for cockatiel sized birds or smaller. Esta jaula la utilizo para la crianza de finches. Es muy conveniente porque, debido a que es sumamente espaciosa, facilitando el que mis finches se mantengan muy activos,  libres de volar de un lado a otro. None This cage is OK once you're done putting it together, but as others had mentioned in their comments it's hard to assemble, the instructions are poorly written and the parts are not labeled. The main problem I encountered was warped pieces and holes that don't align properly with the screws, and need to be forced in with the risk of breaking the whole piece. The plastic food trays don't align and 2 out of 4 came already broken and the other two will probably break after removing for cleaning a couple of times and there is no way to contact the seller, so you will end buying those separate, adding to the cost of the cage. Also, I got this cage for finches, I wouldn't recommend it for big birds as they could open the little doors easily from inside with a little push. This bird cage was an excellent buy! It is an excellent quality, sturdy and well built. It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to put together. A nice weight -- not flimsy like the cage we returned to the pet store. We put it together in less than an hour.  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  The coating on the metal wires is shiny, smooth and easy to clean.  Hammered black -- seems to be a baked on finish. Very attractive and easy to see the birds through the black finish.  Wheels roll easily.  A lower shelf to put cover and seed etc on.  My pair of lovebirds are so very happy in this cage.  With the addition of two short perches in the top section they can truly \"fly\" across this flight cage.  It is not fair or humane to keep birds in little cages and if  at all possible they deserve the biggest cage their humans can manage... and this certainly fulfills those needs. I would recommend and buy this cage again.  Plenty of room for toys, nesting box, swings etc. Good seed and water cups .. 3 long good quality perches included. Prvue cage cover purchased separately -- excellent. I bought this to home my glider. His other cage was a lot smaller and needed more room for him to play and hold all his toys. It only took me about a half hour to put together. Having so many small access doors makes cleaning this cage a breeze. It comes in handy for hanging his pouches and toy's. No more spill's or leaky water bottles for me to clean up. Having four bowls with dividers makes it even easier for me to feed him and get to his water. I really am pleased with this cage.  I'm 66, (almost:), 5'5\" and 118 lbs and had very little problem putting it together myself.  I guess I got lucky, no bent bars and all the holes were there, unlike some of the reviewers who did have bent bars and lacking holes.  The reason for the 4 stars is the feeder cups.  They are VERY difficult (at least mine are) to attach to the bars.  They take some struggle and with finches, these little guys can get out when I've got the doors open struggling to get the feeder cups in and out.  I'd never put water in them because by the time I got them attached, I'd be splashing all the water out.  And, one of my cups came with a broken hook.  That's not really a problem because I plan on replacing all of these feeder cups with feeders that are easier to attach. This is a great cage and not a bad price. I have two of them for each of my two green cheek conures. They have tons of space and it\u2019s very easy to take out the grate and tray to clean. There\u2019s two big doors and some side doors though I\u2019ve zip tied the side doors so my babies don\u2019t decapitate themselves. It\u2019s awful to assemble especially by yourself(I assembled both solo!) definitely have another set of hands when you put it together! I would say it\u2019s good for any bird that\u2019s conure size or smaller. Maybe a slightly bigger bird than that but it\u2019s not the strongest cage ever but like I said, perfect for a conure, maybe two. Oh and I have the covers that fit it so I don\u2019t have an ugly sheet over it. ", "Absolutely amazing cage! Huge, great quality/sturdy, easy to assemble (kiddos and I did it in like 45 min), and super versatile. Our Sun Conure loves it! This wasn't too hard to put together. Needs two people, though. Instructions were okay and image helped a lot. Great quality. Couldn't ask for a better cage. Works perfectly. Glad I bought it and give it two thumbs up! I like the flight cage.  A small bird really can fly in there.  It was not impossible to put together, but it took 2 of us about 3 hours.  Side bars kept popping out.  It was challenging.  This large cage is not as sturdy as my previous cages which had thicker wires that would not bend.  But the trade off is this cage is much lighter to move around.  It also seems easier to clean because the wires are so thin.  This is perfect for parakeets, but is it sturdy enough for a parrot? I do like this cage now that I have it put together but it wasn\u2019t fun putting together. I have 2 screws remaining and had to use a zip tie in it\u2019s place to hold everything together. There was nothing for the screw to screw into... just a hole. Also the instructions say the two back panels are identical and interchangeable which is not true. Overall I do like the cage but just know the assembly is not a good time. The size of this cage is perfect for my four budgies  However, it started to rust immediately after I washed it. This happened despite the fact that I towel dried it, and let it sit in 80 degree direct sun so it would dry quickly. I bought a first one and although it was much larger than what the birds had become used to I wasn't sure the term 'flight cage' should be used as we have 4 cockatiels.  They might have been able to fly vertically but not horizontally. Okay, first off this was delivered on a Sunday, Easter Sunday. That is dedication and I feel a bit guilty about a guy working on Easter Sunday on my behalf. Monday delivery would have been just fine! I enlisted the help of my teenager. We assembled this cage handily, in one hour and ten minutes. It took us a bit longer than some, but we are a meticulous breed and we did a slow and steady pace and made no mistakes. Given that neither one of us is mechanically inclined, this was a great feat for us. You definitely need two people to assemble. One person has to hold the panels in place while the other puts in the screws. Three people would have cut the assembly time and some of the frustration of first one side, then the other, slipping out of place while attempting to attach the screws. This Cafe was returned by a prior purchaser. There were several holes missing, so I had to drill them myself. The panels have two inch long tines that sit in corresponding holes on lower panels? The panels have to be stacked atop each other and screwed together. Some of those holes were not aligned properly and again I had to drill holes. The two large doors are way too easy to open. My birds got out and were unfortunately killed by my dog, as they were young and could only flutter about This is a really nice size cage with plenty of room for my 4 parakeets. I was able to put the cage together by myself even though in the directions it recommends 2 people. It would make it a lot easier if you had someone help you, but it is not impossible to do by yourself. I bought the same cage 3 years ago and it was wonderful....so I bought another one for my Sugar Glider. One of the bars on the back panel is not securely attached and have to hold together with rope. There's a huge gap on the bottom grate where she gets stuck between the grate and the litter pan and almost squished herself in there hiding. I'm not thrilled with this second purchase and feel it might fall apart very quickly. Corners were definitely cut making this cage. ", "Great cage. Price has gone up since I bought it, but was a good deal for the price I paid at under $100. Budgies have room to fly. The cage arrived in good condition. I was able to put it together by myself with the help of a corner in the room, but I have put these types of cages together before. I didn't pay attention to the fact that it has a plastic tray instead of a metal one. Not a deal breaker for the price, but I do like a metal tray for cleaning purposes better. All-in-all a good bargain. Great product for the price. Comes with Tool to put it all together. Lots of room for him now. He seems to like it. I did get new water dishes and food dishes because the ones that come with it are white and I prefer the clear ones. Very good value!!! My lovebird and I couldn't be happier with his new cage. It was on sale for $119 and is one of the best things I have purchased recently.  Even given the dimensions I was unprepared for just how roomy it is. I could have a whole flock of critters living here! After putting this cage together I love it! My green cheek conure loves it too. It is kind of flimsy like the other reviews state, so any birds larger than a sun conure/green cheek could probably destroy it. The cage was extremely frustrating to put together since you need at least two people to hold up multiple pieces while screwing it together. It took my brother and I about an hour. You also might want to zip tie some of the smaller spring loaded doors especially if you have a smart birdie. I could easily see my conure figuring out the doors and escaping.  Other than that it's super roomy and the wheels work great! The wooden perches are also awesome since the cage is so wide. Overall I'd definitely recommend this cage for smaller sized birds since it's so affordable and spacious! When I received the cage the bottom tray was badly cracked - was able to repair sufficiently with gorilla glue since its outside of the actual cage itself. My bird (Olive) is an African Brown-headed parrot, about the size of a conure. Very roomy for her, I think it will hold up well but cage is slightly flimsy - door lock contraption came apart but was able to fix by looking closely at lower door and copying placement. Just can't be too rough with it and should be fine. I had read a review that said this would take a lot of time to set up so I was quite ready to spend my afternoon with a screwdriver and the instruction pamphlet.  However, it arrived while I was at work and by the time I got home my 11 year old son had put it entirely together.  I love the fact that it rolls around.  There is a ton of space for my two parakeets.  In fact, the parakeets were so used to a smaller cage that they are still pretty much just hanging out at the top of it and looking around as if to say, \"Wowzers Jimmie - what are we going to do now?\"  I bought a bunch of extra toys to hang around the cage to make it more fun for them.  The bottom is incredibly easy to pull out and clean.  I have two cats.  One of them is a male hunter type of fellow but after spending the first night about a foot away from the cage watching them intently, he lost interest and realized there wasn't much point to try and get in.  So, the cats meander on by and pay no mind to the budgies inside.  All is well and we've had it about two weeks now so I'm happy with my purchase.  The price is very  reasonable for this size of a cage. I bought this flight cage for my 4 budgies who were feeling overcrowded in their old flight cage. This cage was a steal from this seller at $94 (and free S&H) compared with big-name retailers (and a few sellers here on Amazon) who were charging 2- 3X this price (and charging for the S&H). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this bird house (cage). Putting it together was fun (I was born to put things together), but I can see how someone all alone might be challenged with assembly. A competent helper would have been nice, but with a few pieces of wire and some patience, I put it together in 45 minutes. It's got the high quality of a big parrot cage but created especially for wee birds. I have two rowdy budgies and they love it! The casters work wonderfully, and it doesn't rattle to beat the band when I move it (like some of the cheaper wire cages). The only thing I wish it had was at least one panel of horizontal bars. I didn't use the perches supplied with it, but they looked okay. I use booda rope perches and branches from the trees in the yard. The feeders attach well, and all those access doors are great. All in all a good house for the money. The cage is great for our three budgies.  We are able to open the large front gates and they are able to fly in and out during the day and it secures well for the night.  The cleaning tray easily pulls out, and the large doors make it easy to change water and food. Nice size cage. I have 5 cockatiels in it, and they are very happy.  The only thing I don't like is the small feeding doors on the side, which are spring closing. I would prefer they slide up instead, as it would be safer for my control and easier to use when attaching a nesting box if desired, as I could just clip the door up when using a nesting box.  There is no way to do that with the spring doors.  Also, it would be nice to have a couple smaller doors on the front side. ", "This is a big cage for the price. When it came in the mail some parts where slightly bent but after setting it up you don't notice. I use this cage for my one sugar glider and he loves the space. Two big problems with this cage though, it stains from my animals urine and it's rusting. I bought this cage because the old cage was old and rusty which is extremely unsafe for sugar gliders. I've only had this cage for 9 months and it's already time to look for a different brand that will hopefully last longer. If you're not going to let your birds out they really do need the largest space possible, and I've found that these flight cages are ideal.  There are plenty of doors for easy maneuverability when installing perches, toys and food and water cups. I received this item very quickly. I started immediately when I got home from work. About an hour later, the box was finally open. The company must have read the past complaints.  My box arrive in good condition and better protected than most boxes.  The insides were protected with bubble wrap and Styrofoam.  I had a complete set of instructions which were well written and included  pictures for each step.  The wheel casters are the best I've seen on any cage or piece of furniture that I have assembled.  The tray is fine.  I had a flight cage (no longer being made) with 2 trays the same size.  They were made out of metal and were so heavy I hated pulling them out.  While placing the various bird accouterments, I did notice 2 bars were slightly bent.  They are not noticeable at a distance > 5 inches.  I did not bother straightening them.  It took me 1.5 hours to put the cage together by myself.  The overweight 50 year old lady who put hers together in 30 minutes deserves an award.  If you are working alone you will want something (tape, twist ties, etc) to help hold the upper side parts of the cage  while securing the top.  I do not like the door closing mechanisms., but that is easy to work around.  There are a lot of doors on this cage, 2 large in the front and 3 smaller on each side.  I will use this cage for finches and it seam perfect.  . We bought this floor cage because our zebra finches multiplied unexpectedly and we were in three cages.  We needed to consolidate the cages to make more effective our use of time in daily changes of water and food and in cleaning the cages, and to provide all the birds with prime window space.  We find that cleaning out the bottoms of most hanging or table bird cages to be difficult to do well and the biggest consumer of housekeeping time in bird care an feeding.  This \"flight cage\" looked like the best solution, and has a moderate cost, something not shared with most other offerings of its type.  Construction is not the simplest because it requires that wires from multiple sides of the cage be routed into retaining holes in the frames of the top and sides during assembly, and two people *are* required for proper assembly.  But the result is magnificent.  Two front doors and two doors on each side provide easy access, and no more birds sneaking out past your hand while you are reaching for a bird-bath bowl or other object, because they have plenty of room to stay away from your hand while you are working with the cage.  And, the birds seem much happier, flying around a lot and almost no squabbling among themselves anymore.  The large bottom tray with separate pull-out screen makes bottom cleaning a breeze, which is a really big time-saver.  And, we haven't had a bird escape since we got this new cage. This is just the large cage I was looking for, my birds love the extra space.  I ordered white (and paid more for it) because I wanted to easily see the birds.  It was easy to assemble even for one person.  The directions were very clear, except for putting the front panels on.  The directions stated that the back panels were the same, so it didn't matter which was one was lower  or upper .  But the front panels are different.  I put one on wrong and had to take it off, stripping the allen bolt (and it took quite a while to get it off).  All parts were included and in good condition, no noticeable rough spots.  I would buy this cage again! I was a bit worried when I ordered this cage due to some of the previous reviews about damage and improper fit.  However, I received the carton in great shape and all the parts were enclosed in great condition.  Everything was wrapped in plastic bags and the carton was bound with straps and corner reinforcement. The cage came well packaged. It was a bit difficult setting up because holes were a bit hard to align. The cage is fairly sturdy and the birds are much happier in a larger cage. It comes with several food and water receptacles.  The cage feels like it's going to be filmsy while setting up but after after this put together it feel more substantial. I hesitated after reading the many reviews regarding bent pieces, holes not drilled correctly, bad directions, etc, but I'm glad I went ahead and ordered this cage.  Apparently Amazon and the manufacturer have been reading your reviews. I bought this for finches, it\u2019s definitely huge. I\u2019ll start with the bad, there were two holes that were supposed to be there and they were not. This took me about 5 minutes to get my drill and fix that problem so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal at all. Other than that, there were no missing or broken parts and it seems well made. The cage takes about 30 minutes to put together by yourself and the instructions are pretty straight-forward. Some people might need help at the start when you\u2019re creating a base but I was able to do it on my own. This is a great cage and a really good value for the money in my opinion. Don\u2019t let all the reviewers who said it was hard to put together deter you, I think a 10 year old can easily put this thing together, it\u2019s not complicated at all. Get the extra large, your birds will thank you for the extra room. ", "FUNCTIONALITY: I just got this yesterday and had a friend help me put it together. I could have done it alone but it was nice to have an extra pair of cooperative hands. It is a very simple, sleek, functional cage and I am so excited about it! The instructions were clear and easy to follow. All parts were included and fit together well.  It rolls nicely and the tray and grate slide out easily as well. Bought this cage Sept 2017 for parakeets, and was very pleased. Bought another last week to replace a different cage for another group of parakeets, and am disappointed in the decline in quality. Bars are not quite as sturdy, doors don't latch closed as well, it just isn't the same quality. And I paid $20 more for it than I did last year. I'm not happy about that. I'm keeping it, because it will work, but I'll look elsewhere when I need another cage. This cage is HUGE! I love it, and so do my birds! Wasn't so hard to assemble, but did help to have two people to hold in place. This is such a nice house for my birds - they have room to fly about, and love the double food cups that came with. I really like this cage a lot, and can't find anything to complain about with it. Very happy indeed! What the heck I was not expecting this to be this nice of a cage, at $85 soooooo much cheaper than many of the other cages I looked at, I was expecting poorer quality and not to be as big as the pictures depict, however its HUGE and quality is top notch, even the wheels on the bottom don't catch and allow the cage to move around easily, still can't get over the price, pet stores had cages 1/2 the size for more than what I paid. I recommend this product to anyone that could use a big bird cage.  I have two cockatiels and once they adjusted to their new quarters they have become more playful.  I had been checking the local pet shops for a huge cage and the pricing was more than I wanted to pay.  The price and size for this cage was exactly what I was looking for.  It does take two people to assemble only because someone needs to hold the sides for a few minutes until it is secured in place.  The difficulty of assembling the cage is about 2 with 5 being the most difficult.  The only reason being is it would have been more helpful if the manufacture put sticky tags on each piece to match the letter parts on the instructions.  I have assembled storage units that were labelled exactly as the instructions with sticky labels which took the guess work out of the process.  If the identification of parts would have been better I would have given this product the top 5 stars, but only because there is some guessing for the consumer I gave this product a 4.  However, I still highly recommend this product for anyone that would like to give their bird(s) more room to play.  It is terrific. The feeding bowls came broken and they are VERY tough to utilize in the cage. The spacing between the knobs and the actual cage spacing are very much off. You have to bend the bars by hand to make it fit. This ensures you will spill a lot of the contents. This is my second time purchasing one of these cages. It definitely takes two people to put together. It is a fantastic size for almost any size bird. I currently have 10 finches in it and they act like it's heaven compared to a cage that I bought previously of a \"recommended\" size. Bought this cage for 3 parakeets.  Easy to set up, sturdy, and large!  Several small doors for access.  Tray pulls out for cleaning and storage is under tray.  Nice quality cage! My princess is very happy with this cage. I ordered the XL size for her (She's an Indian Ringneck) and it's the perfect amount of space. It took about an hour for me to set up by myself, and the package was light enough for me to carry upstairs to my apartment. Instructions were pretty clear, and all the parts were there. VERY good cage with a super reasonable price. I would recommend this for small to medium birds. It's not strong enough for bigger birds like cockatoos or Amazon's, etc. A bird like that could easily escape or bend the wires. The bars are close enough together for birds as small as parakeets. Definitely recommend this! ", "I bought this cage back in March for my cockatiel. She loves her mansion. I bring this cage indoors and outdoors with me everyday. When outside, I always have the cage in a caged patio. The many doors are super convenient when cleaning up or when re-arranging the cage. This cage is definitely not for those who have birds that have destructible beaks since the cage bends fairly easily. But you will need to buy several different types of perches for your buddy to get around. This product would have received 5 out of 5 except that the tray to hold the dropping was 1/4 of an inch too short and would not fit in the slider. The tray would just drop out. I feel as if they sent me a tray which was for another smaller birth cage. I hope that I can get a new tray since the birdcage itself is great and my birds just love. I did add this plastic corner piece on each side just to help secure the plastic tray but even with this, the tray will sometime fall out. Does anyone know how I can expand the edge of the dropping catcher so it will actually fit in the slots? This is a wonderful cage for sugar gliders.  Tristan and Istubella are very happy in their new home.  The slide out bottom tray is very convenient for cleaning out every other day.  For days I do the deep clean, it's a snap to roll this cage outside and hose it down.  The wood perches are pretty useless after a few days since it's difficult to get the urine out, but the plastic trays that they come with are great for putting in dry cereal or snacks for the gliders.  I even hide yogurt bites in the tray among other little items so the gliders can forage around for the yogurt bites.  They really seem love this cage.  In fact, I'm thinking to buy another one to connect to my existing cage and maybe get a couple more gliders.  You definitely won't be disappointed for purchasing this cage.  You get so much and at such a great price!! This is a sturdy cage, and the shelf on the bottom is a nice extra for supplies.  Four smaller doors on each side, and two larger on front give good options to reach in.  The final assembled product is definitely five star!  However, I will say an improvement could be to label the panels in order to save time figuring which piece is for what.  You definitely need at least one helper to hold things in place while assembling, two helpers even better! Purchased the cage two months ago for my two cockatiels. They love all the room they now have compared to their previous cage which was about a third the size. Assembly between my husband and I was a struggle, as the pieces are pretty flimsy, and you have to get the pins in the grooves. Once assembled it is a bit more sturdy. It is very light and easy to roll back and forth from room to living room. I wouldn't put anything on top as I think it would cave in. I also did not hang any rope for that reason. I would not buy this if you have anything bigger than a cockatiel, or an overly destructive bird who likes to chew on the bars. I'm pretty sure they could easily be snapped through with a couple of bites. This is a wonderful bird cage.  It came in a flat box, with instructions, and I had no problem putting it together by myself within an hour.  To assemble alone, I just laid the pieces on the floor as if the cage were on it's back, held the sides up by leaning the pieces on nearby chairs.  Easy enough.  The quality is good.  The bars are just flexible enough to put the perches and toys on, but not flimsy. The finish looks like a baked on wrought iron finish, a quality look. The doors are easy swing open with hook latch. The sides have plenty of side doors with spring latch. One of the legs had its holes drilled on the wrong side. It is fixable by drilling your own holes, but for now, I cannot attached the bottom shelf. This problem also resulted in me not being able to assemble the cage as directed. The legs on one side bow in a bit. but his could be because the bottom shelf is not there to keep them spread apart and supported. Overall, not the best cage, but fine for the price. Overall very nice cage. Did not give this cage 5 stars because two of the wires arrived unwelded. The food/water dishes are not properly made to attach to the cage. The hangers on the dishes are not spaced correctly for this cage. One of the dishes arrived Crack. They are very cheaply made and I don't see them lasting long. The parts are not labeled as they are referred too in the instructions. It can be assembled by one person but I highly recommend 2 people. This came in many pieces and was somewhat difficult to assemble, but doable.  There were two spots where the welding didn't take and I had to make sure I compensated so the exposed wire wouldn't poke my birds.  My main issue is with the bottom slide out grill and tray.  There are two tracks and the grill should fit on top and then the tray underneath, but the top track is too narrow to fit the grill into, so I had to put that on the bottom track and use the storage shelf to hold the tray for droppings.  This is not an ideal solution and I'm searching to see if there is a grill/cage bottom that will fit that track (ie. I was sent the wrong one) or maybe I can use bedding/wood pellets in the tray and just have that in the track without the grill.  Otherwise, I did give it 4 stars because it is a nice looking cage and is a great price value.  I couldn't get a cage this size for this price anywhere else!  If anyone has any information or helpful hints with the tray issue, please contact me! I can not say enough about this cage..... I put 2 of them together.  My Parrotlets love it and so do I! Perfect! The X-Large one is perfect for my cockatiels and they love it and so do I. The only thing I don't  understand is the fact I bought 3 cages but could not purchase 3 cage covers because they are limited, so I made my own ", "Had this cage for about 2 years and I have only two small complaints revolving around the sheer number of doors and the poorly fitting refuse tray which appears a bit too small.  The fit and finish is quite nice with the hammered metal look remaining attractive.  When I thoroughly clean the cage it looks virtually new.  For small birds and parrots only. My birds love their new home! I'm 5'0 and was able to put it together myself but it definitely wasn't an easy feat. Get a second pair of hands to help you if you can. The instructions were easy to follow, but unfortunately the cage panels weren't labeled. It took a few trial and errors of putting things upside down and inside out before it was assembled correctly. The only good thing about this cage is the rust started in less than 30 days, so I was able to return it. Like many other people said, the side doors are completely useless. Any animal can open them with little to no effort. I had to zip tie them shut. Assembly was a pain in the butt and things didn't line up. The heads of the screws are so soft that just assembling with the provided screwdriver was stripping the head on the screws. This cage is a waste of time and money. I was worried reading reviews of a hard set up. My husband had it up really quick. I did help hold pieces, so I assume that really shaves some set up time off. In fairness, if I had to do it, it would have been forever. I do not do well with diagrams. That is a problem with me though. The actual item is not at fault. It was not difficult to put together by their flaw. First of all, this is a great cage for my conure, and I am really happy to have gotten it at a good price. It is very big, allowing him to climb and play freely. It also has the right bar spacing for him to climb well and not put him in danger, and the bars are thick enough to stand up to his beak (though a larger parrot would have a field day with them). I deducted a star because it was such a beast to put together. You have to fit multiple wires in multiple holes simultaneously, and then hold the whole thing together to put the screws in. I ended up having to zip tie the front piece together to hold it while it was assembled. I have had 5 cages for my Cockatiels as the flock has grown. This one was my favorite, by far! Aside from being difficult to assemble, this cage was great. It was very sturdy for the price, it was easy to clean, the two doors and the \"nest box\" doors made arranging the cage easy. The cage was sturdy enough for me to attach a playgym to the top, heavy branches to the inside, and plenty of platforms. The birds loved this cage, and the flat top was a great place for them to hang out. I bought this July 2012. It has held up well. I have 2 small Conures.  Like other reviews, the side doors  make no sense. We wired them shut, but one of them chewed the wire and here she went, flying around! Cats got freaked out, and the dog was like,, \"coool\" .I have no problem with the food dishes, sometimes I do tho, have trouble getting one end to latch onto the cage, but,  I eventually get it on there. It doesnt bother me. There is a ton of space and the wheels..... I love the wheels! I roll the birds into the back room every night, and then wheel them back into the living room for the day. I believe they love the ride! I got this cage for $94 with a $15 off coupon offered by Amazon. I would buy this again. I absolutely love it as do my sugar gliders! I wish the parts came better labeled, but it wasn't that difficult to assemble. Two people are supposed to assemble it, but I was able to do it by myself in about two hours. I actually got this cage for my two sugar gliders and they absolutely love all of the new space! It arrived quickly and very well packaged. I wasn't concerned in the slightest about any possible damage. The directions call for some pliers to help guide a few of the wires into the holes, but I didn't need them at all- that's how great and easy this way to assemble. I didn't need any of my own tools, it came with everything it needed. At $94, I'll buy this a few more times for my animal fostering. Pros: this is a great deal. Its definitely made cheap, but its still sturdy. Something like this would easily be 300 dollars in a chain pet store, this same model goes for 180$ at my local country max so you are definitely saving some money. I am using it for my juvenile ring neck dove. It could also easily be used for some parakeets, canaries or finches. A larger parrot would definitely break out. Its not necessarily hard to put together but takes some time and is easier if a second person is there to help. definitely would recommend. ", "I recently received this cage for my two parakeets. My husband put it together and he had the same issues that many others have had with the instructions - or lack there of. There were also some bent bars but all in all it didn't take him much time to put it together. Once it was together it was perfect - incredibly large in size, especially for my two birds. You could easily fit four or five parakeets in here comfortably. I don't have experience with other birds, so I'm not sure there. Though I would say any very large or strong bird wouldn't do well. For my birds personally I moved them into this cage from one that was 20 x 16 x 29 inches - so quite a change. They spent the first few days in the same upper corner before eventually starting to branch out and explore. They are still learning their way around and getting used to a new environment, so if your birds seem a little scared at first I would give them time to adjust. Also my girls are just learning to fly and there is plenty of space here for them to do that. Overall an excellent cage for small birds, plenty of room for a variety of perches, toys and flight. Bought this for Olivia, budgie, and to get another one. Thats all, granted the cage can hole 20 birds, but any responsible pet owner would not do that, ...I wanted 2 two to be super comfortable with tons of room. They also have a rope climb to enjoy the top of the cage as well, which is being made into a second play area. The finish on this cage is as pictured. very nice. The top panel of our cage came bent, but we didn't have time to contact the seller as we needed the cage put together asap. The feeding cups are nice but don't fit the cage. The only way they fit is if one of the hanging clips is attached in a door opening. Then the 2nd will fit between the bars. Other wise the hangers aren't spaced correctly for the bar spacing...very inconvenient...not to mention that the doors will not completely close with the food cup hanger in the way :(  The best part of this cage is its size. Otherwise, its just Okay...  ......................................................................................................................... Using this to house a covkatiel.  I would have liked the very bottom shelf to be an inch ur two further from the floor so I could vacuum the area under  it without moving the cage.  The latches on the 2 large doors are very easy to use.  I didn\u2019t realize when I ordered it that it included perches and feed cups, what a nice surprise.  It was a little bit of a challenge to put together for one person but definitely doable. This bird cage was easy to put together once I organized the wire panels on the floor and tried to organize them so that I knew what I had. Following the instructions precisely was the key and there are a couple of steps where it helps to have an extra helping hand to keep the parts from falling down before they are attached with allen screws (Allen wrench was supplied). This is at the beginning of the assembly process. The only glitch was one top wire panel that required drilling two holes, an obvious quality control problem. Once I drilled the two holes on one panel, everything went together smoothly. It took me a total of about 2 hours to organize, assemble and drill. The completed aviary was pure heaven for our two parakeets. They started to fly in it and try out all the perches (which are more like a parrot diameter, but the parakeets quickly adjusted to them). They loved the added space and are extremely happy and thankful! A great product at a great price compared to many others that I looked at. Made in China, unfortunately, but it's hard to find anything made in the U.S. these days. After reading the negative reviews I was a bit weary of buying this, but I decided to anyways. My arthritic 13 year old cockatiel's old cage was too small to put an assortment of perches in. You can't beat the size and price of this cage. I bought this cage for my mother in laws 2 cockatiel birds. The cage is HUGE and definitely a great bargain for the size. It is A lot more reasonable than petsmart/petco and other online places I searched before finding this one. Great for my sugar gliders, came with plenty of food trays and wooden perches, 3doors on each side(spring hinged) and 2doors on the front although the bottom one could be slightly larger to accommodate the wheel since it has to be removed several times weekly to be cleaned.10/17 I now have rust on several places on the cage where the coating has chipped off. There isn't anything I don't like about this flight cage!  And I believe I can speak for my four parakeets too.  Very attractive, because of the bright white wires and very easy to clean compared to the cages I've purchased for my birds.  Great buy!  I am glad that I finally decided to get this. Cage was packaged well. All pieces accounted for. Nothing was bent or broken. While other reviews said directions were hard to follow, I found them fairly easy. The cage definitely requires two people to put together. We had it together in approximately 20 minutes. My only complaint is that the six small doors do not have any latches. So you will need something to keep them closed. We used large binder clips, not the prettiest, but our Mynas also like to play with them. Overall the cage is a great purchase and the birds love it. ", "It is perfect for my growing zebra finch family. The new additions Ham Cheese and Biscuit and parents Wally and Polly just have non stop been chanting in there. I only gave four stars because some of the wires were bent from the delivery. Fortunately, nothing was broken. However, I do see how it could be possible to get completely broken items. Thus, it is a risk but i have never had a problem with returns through Amazon. So be weary! The cage came right on time and in good condition. The finish is very attractive and easy to keep clean. I have had birds for many years and this cage is my favorite. It houses eight parakeets quite well I think. They have lots of room to climb as parakeets like to do, and it was fairly simple to arrange the interior for some flight. I like that it is somewhat lightweight and on wheels so I can easily move it when caring for them. The doors (there are many) are spring loaded so I have wired them shut to prevent them pushing out or being let out by little hands. It takes awhile to put together. My daughter and I spent about an hour figuring it all out and assembling it. Some of the parts don't fit exactly right but you can make adjustments. It comes with 4 large dishes to clip on the bars. It is a little awkward to get them in and out and I always spill the water. I now put the dish in after cleaning and then fill it in place. I certainly like it well enough to consider another for some of my other birds I bought one for my Quaker parrot and I loved it so much that I bought a second one for my cockatiel. There is plenty of room for toys, perches and swings. I used my own bowls because the plastic ones that come with the cage can be easily knocked down by my mischievous birds. Set up isn't too hard, I've put together many birdcage though so that probably helped. I will say that the spring loaded doors on the sides are not very secure. My Quaker is quick to figure out locks and door so I just zip tied them all closed. My only major complaint is the little shelf at the bottom is pretty much useless. It's far too shallow to fit food containers or really anything else. Other than that, it's a great cage and we love it! This was a replacement for a cage that was smaller and literally tried to kill my bird. I just received this today.  I put it together in less than an hour, after getting the very large box open and all the parts separated.  We are very impressed with the size and wish we bought this at least a year ago.  We have seven small'ish birds that we kept in two separate cages.  This cage is quite perfect for all of them together which will reduce our cleaning and maintenance work significantly.  The design is good, there are many doors with which to access the different areas of the cage which is important for a cage this size.  The large tray at the bottom is great for taking in and out to replace the wood shavings.  Overall we are very happy and cannot recommend this product highly enough if you have finches or canaries. I bought this cage for a pair of indian ringnecks. It is very spacious and gives them lots of room to move around. Its easy to clean because both the bottom tray and bottom grate can slide out. The cage was easy to assemble within an hour. I did have to use needle nose pliers to bend the big door latches so that they could be more easily opened. I also had to zip tie shut all of the side doors because they do not close securely and it is very easy for medium size birds like indian ringnecks to figure out how to get out of them! I do wish that the standing height of the cage was taller. The space between the floor and the bottom tray should be taller, or maybe have some type of a sliding mechanism so that people could raise the cage easily. I ended up putting ours on top of a platform to elevate the birds so that they would feel more comfortable going down lower in the cage. Overall this is a great spacious cage for a really reasonable price. Overall, the cage came relatively quickly and I was able to put it together within two hours. I'm sure that if I had someone to help me it wouldve gone a lot smoother and with less hassle than how it went with my petite self. Assembly wise it went well until I had to assemble the very top piece, which when alone can be very time consuming and tricky. However, was easily put together for something so large. The only issue I did have with the cage, and the reason for deducting a star, is that two bars on the cage came bent and was a disappointment. Aside from that, all I had to do extra was zip tie the small easily opened flaps on the side to prevent my Indian Ringneck from opening them which could be dangerous. But an easy fix nonetheless. I love the size and price.  I wouldn't recommend this cage for large birds because the bars are kind of thin, but for my little conures, it is perfect.  I keep this in the livingroom for all 3 of my birds to be in during the day, and they all have their own smaller cages to sleep in at night. Plenty of room for flight and movement with 3 parakeets.  In fact, I could easily fit 2 - 3 more birds in here if I wanted and they would be happy.  I chose NOT to use the grate on the bottom because I didn't want to hurt their feet so we simply slide the tray in that slot and it works perfectly.  My only complaint is that I can't find additional perches to fit the cage. \u2665 We had no problem with the order or even putting the cage together.  However, when we put the black plastic tray in -- it fell out.  It is just staying in the track barely.  The slightest move causes it to fall out.  I do not have time to take it all apart and send it back.  We are adopting a new bird, and getting her Monday.  I would truly like to receive a replacement tray that fits and does not fall out. ", "I love my cage! The cage is amazing! Huge amount of room. We have finches and they love the room! Very sturdy and well made. I def recommend this cage. We r going to breed so we will be having more than 2 but they love it we love it! Came in a few days. The only thing for improvement is the directions nothing was numbered so we puzzled on what goes where. Took about an hr. Everything else was great!!! This thing really wasn't hard to put together until the ceiling- super *fun* to align 5 panels to their corresponding pins at once. Everything else was easy. It's a great buy for the price and mine came without any broken bits. The spring loaded doors are goofy- any critter with half a brain can fiddle its way out. I purposefully installed mine to where the door swings inward. Either way, I recommend adding a latch of some sort (I'm thinking small carabiner clips). I would say this cage is perfect for its price. Good looking and durable metall alloy, nice size for bird (we have a conure), has a shelf for storing stuff, 6 small side spring doors and 2 big locking front doors. I gave 4 star because of: -there is a mistake in instruction so we had to separate and redo the cage during assembling, - thin plastic bottom tray where could be metal one, - 4 plastic feeders kinda look cheap. Some parts were bent causing assembly to be a little tough.  Instructions were hard to follow so we had to figure it out for ourselves.  2 of the dishes that came with cage were cracked and couldn't be used.  There are 4 spring loaded doors (2 on each side) that I had to ziptie shut because the birds could easily push them open and escape.  The cage itself is not very strong and we had to drill holes in the framework in order to assemble.  Once together, it's a good size for my 2 cockatiels and gives them plenty of room to move around but I was expecting better quality. Great cage. Believe it or not, I purchased this for a couple of polish chickens. They are still young and it has gotten a bit cold here in Tennessee. It has space for them to spread their wings and I bought a little deck and added the perches and they are so happy. It did take two people to put together but was not hard at all! Great price! I have two of these cages now for over 6 months. They have more then reached the expectations that we were looking for. The unit is solid. Strong. And easy to move and work with. So many openings into the cage area. Allows you to The cage is big and easy to assemble in about 30 minutes. The only downside is that lovebirds can easyly trow seads outside the cage because feeders are located too high and there is no plastic screen around the bottom of the cage. We had to install a plastic screen around the cage and relocate the feeders near the bottom. There is less mess around the cage now. Cleaning of the cage is easy though. The directions were a joke, there is no way an inexperienced person could understand how to put this cage together. I had to use the directions from someone else on the computer, thank you to them. One of the screw holes was not machined for the screw threads to go into, it was literally impossible so my husband had to find a compatible screw and work to insert it into a hole that had no threads. It is flimsy when trying to move on the rollers. If I had known these problems in advance I would not have purchased it. I did notice on the outside of the box that it was made in china and not the U.S.A. which was a mistake on my behalf.  I love shopping at Amazon but this product simple was not worth the money in my and my husband's opinion. As another reviewer stated, this cage is more wrought iron colored than black. The bars would not stand up to a bird with a big beak, but that is okay since this cage shouldn't be used for that anyways. So, we decided not to clip our parakeets' wings, because birds are supposed to fly, right? We ordered this cage and absolutely love it. ", "Multiple popped welds and 2/4 of the cups were cracked or broken. The item was simple to put together however the different pieces were quite bent and warped so we had to force some things into the right place. Despite this it took me and my husband maybe 20 minutes to put it together. Decent size for the money, the wheels are a plus. Good quality and reasonably easy to assemble.  Plastic tray and one of the feeders were cracked on arrival, but easily fixed with epoxy.  I also wish the perches were a bit shorter to make them removable, we ended up setting them up diagonally.  But overall impression is good, it looks nice, easy to move, easy to clean, and The Bird loves it. I have lost four birds in this cage their wings got through the bars in the corners ,two almost lost their wings, this  carge  is not my cup of tea and will not get this kind again . But all in all looks good love the color green and that it is easy to clean. The feeders aren't the greatest apon opening it one was already broken the other two tabs broke off when I tried to  hook them in place. screws come loose when you move it . The cage is not sturdy, if you are trying to put a Dragon in it. For parakeets this is heaven! This cage is awesome! I almost didn\u2019t buy it because of all the negative reviews about it coming with broken pieces and being hard to put together. The price for a cage this size was just far too appealing to pass up. My five parakeets love this cage and my boyfriend and I are already working on filling it with toys for them to play with. He put it together and reported back that it was relatively easy so maybe they\u2019ve improved since the past reviewers ordered theirs. If you\u2019re on the fence about ordering this cage, go for it! Also all of the food and water dishes came intact. I haven\u2019t checked about the doors that the birds can open themselves but we typically keep the doors open and let them fly all day anyways. CONS:  Included instructions are not helpful. Birdcage need parts to be labeled so you know which part to assemble to which part of the cage. Definitely requires 2 people to assemble, one to hold the cage together and the other to assemble and insert the screws in. The side doors need a latch so that the birds cannot escape if they push against it or if another house pet (ie. cat/dog) is clever enough to open the doors. The bird feeder trays are not easy to attach or remove from the sides of the cage, without the fear of spilling seeds or water all over the place.  You have to attach them very carefully or remove very carefully. The measurements are as noted in the product description, but once assembled it looks much larger than expected. However it fits perfectly in the spot I made for it. We were so pleased with this cage.  My son wanted to give his parakeets room to fly and play, and this is perfect.  I looked at and studied a lot of different cages and decided on this one because it's more cage room than storage.  Some cages are the same dimensions, but the cage portion is a lot smaller for various reasons.  Our goal was more cage room, so this fit our needs.  It was pretty easy to put together and I love that it's a powder-coated finish.  We were also very pleased with the price. Excellent value for the money. This is a really big cage. It will have enough room for about 15 budgies and be completely fine. The build quality is a bit under welming for the price, but still very good. When I recieved mine the package was slightly damaged. Obe of the four feeding troughs were damaged but thats not a big deal for me as I still have three more and the tray that goes in the bottom was cracked bad. I contacted Prevue for a replacement part and under there 90 day warranty they sent me one for free. I just hope that UPS treats this one better. Overall great product and great customer service from Prevue. Will defiantly consider them for any future products. ", "I've had this cage for a month now for my green cheek conure.  Its a nice cage for smaller birds it would be more perfect.  For parrots not so much. So this cage is great for birds I have 3 Budgie and a cockatiel in it and you can put enough food in there where you can leave for at least a one week vacation and not have to worry about anyone looking after your pets. I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you REALLY prepare your cage and know how your birds minds work. I like that the price for this cage was reasonable.  It took two of us to put it together.  There were a few places where the wire was bent which was repairable. I have two little finches in this xtra large cage and it is more cage than they need, so will be putting my two parakeets in the bigger one and finches in the large cage. Package was delivered in a box with reinforced corners to diminish damage. Received package 1 day after placing order. All of the parts were included and well made. Assembly directions were easy to read and it took me about 20 minutes to assemble by myself. Great product well made for the price! I ordered the size large (not the extra large) and I was worried about space, but once I put it together my cockatiel had more than enough space to fly around. You could fit multiple cockatiels in this cage. the side doors are only spring loaded to close so you  may want to put clips or ties on the doors if you have a good size smart bird. You can leave the wire covering the bottom of the cleaning tray on or off. Would definitely recommend this cage, you cant beat the price. I used this for my 3 sugar gliders and they love the space. I put it together by myself in about 45 min. Sturdy construction, close spacing on the bars and it looks great. The only thing that made it better was the price. I have had none of the other problems that I read about with rust, sharp edges, or assembly issues and I've had it for 3 months now. I'm not great with words and don't normally leave reviews, but I'm so pleased with this cage I felt I should. After less than a year the tray wouldn't stay attached and the rickety stand broke making the cage impossible to move to another part of the room without breaking it even more and making the entire cage useless. I had to zip tie the spring doors on the sides shut from the beginning because my parakeets could easily push them open and escape. This was a waste of money. Poor directions, lots of doors that open in a manner a clever bird could get out (light springs are all that hold the side doors shut, we wound up tying those doors closed). I recieved my new bird cage this week and it is wonderful! A great size for the price (saw a similar flight cage in my local bird shop for $365). I only have one cocktail but I feel it would be comfortable for maybe three. The shelf space on the bottom is nice. Sturdy and large enough to place a play set comfortably on top of the cage. Only thing I did not note before my purchase was the small spring doors on the sides. I was concerned they could be easily opened, either by my bird or his kitty house mate. So for safety reasons I attached a quick link to the small doors as pictured above. Overall love my purchase. I liked the fact that there is no lots of room for my birds to fly around in. What I don't like is the way the side doors are, they are spring loaded and (for me) difficult to secure so the birds don't try to get out. Overall, this is a great product and I would recommend it to everyone who has smaller birds, i.e. canaries, parakeets. ", "Most of the time he feels safe... only time he doesnt is when the other furbabies decide to \"visit\". This is why a give it a 5 on sturdiness...it holds up when my silly labradoodle decides his brain is gone runs and jumps at the cage... the doddle is a standard poodle size For price and size, this cage is pretty good. However, the construction is poor. It came with bent bars, and now I have to use a towel over the top to make sure my finches can't get out.  While this cage looks good, it is clearly of an inferior quality. Great size and a good option for small birds like budgies, finches or cockatiels. Anything larger than that and I'd be worried the bird might snap the bars. Good cage for the size but needs to be modified after purchase.  I replaced all the dishes with stainless steel, perches and made better latches for the doors as any bird over the size of a finch can open the side doors and be injured, killed or escape.  I need flight cages and this is the best for the size but not the same quality as their Park Plaza cages which I have 2 of their mediums and would buy more if they made longer in length. Some of the holes for the screws weren\u2019t big enough and I had to file them down so I could attached the sides and back if the cage. Because two of the holes weren\u2019t the right size, they cage didn\u2019t quite fit the way it should and the tray does not fit.  Also, don\u2019t bother reading the assembly instructions, see what the pieces are and put it together because their instructions don\u2019t make the most sense, especially if you have to file down some pieces to make them fit I personaly did not have a problem with shipping and I was able to set it up on my own.  The food dishes were not cracked. My dislikes where that the lock was easy to op thus I would find my sun conure ringing his bell toy on his purch outside of his cage in the middle of the night,  was not to hard to fix with a normal lock. The tray at the bottom sometime falls out when I clean it , only once or twice but not something I go on about too much. Either way I love this cage and my sun conure loves it too. PERFECT! I purchased this last year for my parakeets, I had 4 of them in there and there was room for them to fly and play. Its not completely black, there are spots of silver but it looks better that way in my opinion. The pull out tray makes it easy to clean. Definitely put glass or plastic around the bottom so seeds can't fly out because the food has to be close to the top of the cage. I have to vacuum around the cage twice a day because there is such a big mess. If its your first time owning a bird.....let me tell you they are MESSY. People told me they were and I didn't really believe them until i got my own. They make up for it however with their beautiful singing and bright colors. I sub jest this cage, its big so make sure you have the room for it. We needed a new cage for our quaker. I wanted something big enough to give him plenty of space to play. This cage is perfect...probably bigger than he needs - but exactly what I wanted. I was able to assemble it on my own, it was easy and super sturdy. Very happy with the purchase. My sugar gliders love this cage! It's tall & wide enough for them jump around & play in. There were only 2 things that wasn't the best about the cage & one is there are 3 little doors (total of 6) on each side that can easily be pushed open. I just put a chain link hook in a couple spots to secure the doors though so they don't escape. Second thing is the wheels don't lock in place. Overall I'm really happy about my purchase & it took me about an hour to set up by myself which is not bad at all. Wow so far I love this cage. I have three cockatiels, one pair and one accidental offspring. They love the cage. Now needs to be stocked up with toys to keep them busy. It was really easy to put together. Some parts were bent, but that was expected. It does not compromise the integrity of the cage at all. My birds are happy and I am happy. ", "For $104 I decided not much to lose here. That said.... It took 3 ppl to assemble; the thin metal bends easily so unless you can use hands and feet, prepare for 3 graceful but handy puzzlers at assembly. While contortedly but gently holding the final pieces together we discover we are short a bolt. The instructions stated 16 were included in the box, my son counted 12 needed, but only 11 were present. Perhaps the company only throws in a handful, idk, but it was very unnerving coming up with a temporary solution in the finale of a 3 ring assembly circus. I invest my money to buy this tall bird cage to please my daughter as a surprise gift ... and I am very happy to say it's all worth it!  With the price much under $200 when I bought it, certainly it is quite a better bargain than others that have similar size but cost much higher, and yet still is a decent product for our small parakeets.  Now our 5 small birds (and growing ...) can jump around their cage freely and we can put more toys and decorations inside the cage, and as the result both the birds and my family are a lot more happier ... Great cage for the price.  Take your time putting it together.  As other reviewers have stated, the directions aren't great and the pieces aren't labeled... but if you study the pictures, and have a little common sense, you should be good to go.  Also, when box arrived, the plastic pan was cracked.  Simply called Prevue, and they shipped one out, no questions asked.  received the replacement 2 or 3 days later.  Great customer service, great product. But, the instructions were confusing and I had to figure it out on my own.  Make sure the openings are on one side and the catcher tray is on the same side so you won't have to turn the cage around to pull out the tray...it takes at least 2 people to get it put together.... Cage arrived well packaged.  All parts were included and cage sides/wires were not bent. I assembled it myself. Took about 45 minutes.  I found that putting on the top piece after the sides made it more stable and assembly went quicker.  It wheels around well. I have zebra finches,  they love this cage!! Easy to clean.  Many doors for easy access to inside.  Worth the investment My partner put this together himself in less than an hour (with just a couple of minor struggles). It shipped fast and is a great mansion for our pet cockatiel. It would be a suitable size for a pair, as well. We also have a cat and we were worried when integrating the households that the cat would be...curious...about the bird. While the cage is a little lower to the ground than anticipated, there aren't any gaps in the wires and we're confident that she wouldn't be able to get at him even if she wanted to. Finally, we love that it's lightweight and has wheels so that we can easily bring him room to room with us! Came in a little banged up, but took barely an hour to assemble. Very pleased with my purchase and I bought a used one. Shipping was terrible, but that was moreso UPS. So far my cockatiel loves the extra space and I may need to add another bird. It comes with feeders and perches, but the front door needed instructions to assemble and took me a minute to figure it out. Only issue I really had was that a lot of the pieces were bent, but it was a used cage, so it was expected. Still worth every penny and would recommend. The size is perfect. Instructions are fairly easy to follow. Main thing we had problems with was the side and front panels were missing the predrilled holes where the sides connect. We just used small zip ties to hold the sides of the cage together. It was gonna be to much of a hassle to send it back and have to wait for another cage, we needed it that day. I have one parakeet and she LOVES the space. Her wings are still clipped so I'm waiting to see how well she flys around once her wings grow back. This cage could easily house a conure, cockatials, parakeets, finches, or doves. Kinda hard to assemble but honestly- the product is worth it! \ud83d\ude02 really nice and bigger than I expected. This has exceeded all expectations. The only thing I\u2019m a tad concerned about are the small side doors on either side of the cage. I\u2019m concerned because they don\u2019t have locks on them. If my bird trying to escape I\u2019ll probably use a paperclip to hook the door shut. But otherwise this cage is beautiful! I got the Large size. ", "I love the cage my parakeets love it easy to put together and also great mobility. The only reason i gave a 4 star was the tray, looked like its to small well about half an inch and does not fit the slot. Going to have to modify it. Overall awsome cage I have two cockatiel that now have this flight cage as a new home. This is a very good product for the price. It definitely  is a 2 to 3 person project.  Cleverly designed and as sturdy as one would expect for the price, good for small to medium sized birds. It is definitely not an option for larger bird such as a Parrots or Maccall. I almost didn't buy this cage based on some of the other reviews, but I'm glad I did. My 2 society finches love it! I can't believe how big it is and how much room they have to fly compared to the other smaller flight cage they were previously kept in. If I would have realized how much better and bigger this cage was I would have bought it for them a long time ago. There would be room to house a couple more small birds as well. I was able to put it together in about an hour and a half by myself. It isn't too difficult once you figure out where each piece goes. If you are keeping small finches you might want to buy a couple of additional perches. The perches that come with the cage are much larger in diameter than my birds are used to. first off the up cost is a lot to spend if you want  to get some parakeets. i bought this cage and thought the bird would have a lot of room . which they do. when i got my birds and put them in the cage and the birds toys . they did nothing. probably getting used to the cage. after the nineth day they started to roam the cage. and that made me happy.they are flying around from perch to perch. loving the swing that i got them. sometimes i think they play knock the other parakeet off the swing.its a site to see. my birds are really happy in this cage. As always I was impressed by the excellent service and on time (actually arrived 1 day early) delivery provided by Amazon.  This product exceeded my expectations in every way for its price.  I am extremely pleased with this products quality.  The cage is made of high quality very durable cage wire, and its frame is very sturdy and solid with excellent connections.  It is well designed for easy access to various parts of the cage with multiple access doors.  It has large fly through cage doors in front for my parakeets who are granted free range in my apartment all day so they can fly in and out easily.  My parakeets are in 7th heaven with this cage and have become MUCH more active than before when they were in a much smaller cage. This is a very nice cage for the money. My two sun conures love it in here and there is plenty of space for both their beds, toys and more to come! I would cautiously build the cage to make sure everything is in the right spot, but all in all a very good product. Other reviews may make you nervous to buy and honestly I wish I bought sooner! 10/10 would recommend for small-medium hookbills and parakeets. Only thing is I zip tied the spring doors on the side to eliminate any chance of them getting out or hurt. For parakeets i would recommend putting newspaper on the bottom so their feet don\u2019t fall through. No dents. No missing screws. In tact and only took me an hour to build with my brother! I would recommend at least one other person to help you build it. I\u2019m 19 and I built this on my own. It took roughly an hour maybe an hour and a half because I was struggling to hold up all of the pieces while trying to put the screws in place. Definitely recommend second pair of hands. It\u2019s really good quality though. Although I messed up the assembly by put the pullout tray thing on the opposite side, now I have to flip my cage just to pull out the tray so that sucks big time. Lots of space and the babies love it!! For the price of a good, big cage, you do need to assemble it yourself. However, it isn't hard if you're somewhat handy. Put it together myself in a couple of hours (probably would have taken less time with a helper). It's sturdy and easy to move on its wheels. It might be tricky at first, if you're not making sure all the wires align, and it is definitely a loud process to put together, but it's quite large and durable. There's a lots of room in there, and will make my parakeets happy to flutter around freely. A great value for a roomy flight cage,  well built, nicely finished.  The package came complete with all necessary hardware, the welding and finishing seem done with care. This is a very high quality cage. My birds and I both love it, and I couldn't be happier with the cage itself. It's a little tricky to put together, I would definitely recommend two people or more on this project, because I don't think I could have done it on my own. What I'm not so happy with, however, are the cheap plastic bowls that come with the cage, one of which came broken after shipping, the other broke after trying to put it on the cage. Luckily it comes with 4, but none of them really fit anywhere but the one location they're meant to. Plus, if you have anything larger than a budgie/parakeet, I would recommend getting stainless steel bowls, because any larger bird would shred these ones almost immediately. ", "Parts were bent, but I worked it out. The wire is very thin, so best for parakeet (budgie) or finch types. But my Max Pionus doesn't pick at or bend bars, so she's fine in it. Other parrots might bend the bars or easily escape. So far, so good! We've only had the cage for a few days, but our finches love it. Assembly wasn't too bad for 2 of us -  had it only been 1 person, it would be a much different story. We put it together in about 30 minutes, but by yourself, I could see it taking 2 hours! There was 1 broken weld on the back panel, but we zip tied that. The small doors leave a lot to be desired and they're the reason for the 4 star review. Our no-mess feeder would not work with the side doors, so now that is on the inside. Other than the size of the doors, they do create great access points. The perches that come with the cage are not great either. They're a little long and hard to place - plus, they're way too big around for little birds (the kind of bird this cage is designed for).We did leave them in the cage, but added our own perches too. This gives them a good variety for perch size and is better for their feet. Bar spacing is good too. I was trying to find 3/8\" spacing, but the 1/2\" spacing still keeps the cat paws out and the birds in. As of now, we have been rolling this from the livingroom to a secure place for the birds overnight, until we are comfortable with the cats and the cage. We have had no problems rolling the cage and it has not tried to fall apart as other reviewers have mentioned. Just be sure to tighten the screws. Overall, we are pleased with this cage and would buy it again. We bought this for our sugar gliders. It was fairly easy to put together. One person may be able to do it but a second person just to help hold the pieces in place is a big help.  It comes with 2 large doors on front that have slide locks.  It also has multiple spring load doors for access but we just zip tied them closed and ours pay no attention to the zip ties.  The front doors are plenty big enough to get most any toys you would want in the cage.  Not steady enough for kids to climb on, would easy bend if to much weight is placed on shelf, such as putting foot on it.  Has wheels so easy to move around the room. Package arrived on time and was described correctly by seller as a little damaged to the box.  However everything was fine inside and I was able to unpack it and put it together.  It was a little out of shape but I was able to bend the wires to fit in each slot now the birds can fly around the cage and seem to like it.  It was very noisey this morning.  Doors are nice and placed all over the cage but the side doors may have to be secured with ties because if they discover they can push them open with their little heads they will get out and fly everywhere in the house.  We learned not to underestimate them.  Very happy with product. While this cage did take two people to assemble, it was very simple. A lot more simple than the similar Critter Nation cage I had previously. The price is reasonable. The cage seems sturdy. I don't care for the bowls it came with but I already had some so no big deal, there. The package was very securely packaged and came promptly. Description says it comes with 4 seed cups, mine came with 2. Photograph shows 4 of them.  Also, the hooks in the molded plastic seed troughs do not align with the bars of the cage, so I used the food cups that I recently bought for the other cage, and they work fine. This is the seed cup listing for what I bought: I love how much room this cage has for birds. Plenty of room for true flight for your birds. I add greenery, moss, and natural branches to make the cage beautiful. I don't think you could do this with hook bills, but it works wonderfully with canaries and finches. The cage is large enough to allow the canaries and finches to breed with no aggression. My only \"complaint\" is the legs should be much longer. The cage sits too low to the ground ( I have 3 ferrets ), so I had to buy a low profile coffee table that works great. This cage is a good deal for the money ! This cage is a great cage for the money. It took me, my daughter and my 7 yr. old granddaughter about 40 minutes to put it together. You will definitely need an extra pair of hands to stabilize it. I have two parakeets in it, and they love it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the dowel perches are too big for my parakeets. They are 1 inch. I wish there was an option to order the perches in different sizes. I just went to Lowes and bought 1/2 in. dowels, cut them down to 31.5 inches and notched the ends. I paid about $6 to replace the perches. I also had an issue making the food dishes fit. But I prefer water silos and stainless steel bowls, so it wasn't really that big of a deal. Good size and quality for the price. Two of 4 trays came in broken and cracked though. No need for all side doors with weak springs. Used the hook trays to keep them locked. Easy 1 man assembly. Came with the Allen wrench, used a rubber mallet to tap some parts down that wa tight. Concised and easy to follow instructions. Careful on those tack weld also, easy to break (rookie job). I have to tie wrap on two sections.... so far. I put the entire cage together by myself.  I am not good at these things but the instructions were perfectly clear and easy to follow.  My husband was pleasantly surprise that I was able to put the entire cage together by myself.  My eclectus parrot loves it.  There was only one bent bar and I was able to fix it.  All other parts were perfect.  I would definetly recommend this product to others. ", "I am very pleased with this cage.  I bought the extra large size for my tame house sparrow as a home, not a confining \"cage\".  He comes out to fly and eat dinner with us regularly, but on those days he can't come out, he needed a home large enough for flight, toys, food and veggies, and his nest tent.  The cage went together easily with two people, but we have a bit of experience putting bird cages together.  Ours doesn't have any issues except one of the hang on bowl's hooks is broken.  I'm not using them so... meh. Arrived with all pieces, but the metal was shaped such that it is impossible to get all of the holes lined up to fasten. I contacted the customer service email provided in the box, and have received no response from Prevue in a months time. I bought this cage for my four finches and it has worked wonderfully. It offers plenty of room for them to fly. OMG I love this flight cage it is perfect for my Quaker Parrot. Was very easy to put together and it was awesome that no parts were missing. Previously purchased a cage before this one and that was a disaster. I am so happy this manufacture had easy to read instructions and all parts were included. I love this cage! Has changed the birdies lives since i took them out of the tiny starter cage they were gifted in. They are more active and even spend a couple of minutes a day flying from side to side for fun. For those wanting to double up on the gages. I made mine taller instead of wider. Easy to fit together ended up with one extra top and the legs and 2 bottom panels. Also gives me an extra bottom tray for when the first one gets to old. I had to cut off 4 of the nubs things in pic 2 and added 4 small mending plates I found at Walmart for .79.  Took about 1 hour and 1 helper.  I already had the one cage so the 1 hour is just for retro fitting the 2nd cage to the first.  Basically you just make the 2nd cage without the bottom legs and base. And you take the top off the first cage and attach them. Good luck. I love these cages This company has no quality control. Another cheap Chinese product. To keep my birds from using the side doors to fly out I had to bend paper clips around them. Some of the screw holes don't line up and had to due without, luckily enough holes lined up to keep it together. My birds have plenty of room to fly around now. I love the cage overall.  I use it for my rats and not for birds as it was intended, but they have lots of room to run around and play, and I have plenty of room to hang toys and chews and stuff for them.  It is however incredibly difficult to put together.  A friend and I managed to put it together but it probably would have gone better with three people instead of just the two of us.  Also the pan at the bottom doesn't fit right.  Its a bit small for the cage, all the space is covered so there is no extra mess but its hard to get it to stay where it is suppose to sit.  One corner or another always seems to want to fall out.  That is something that with some effort I've managed to deal with, but it is a pain to have to mess with it every time I clean cages. This cage is huge! Perfect for 4 budgies. Likely can fit 6 Show (English) Budgies. Or can fit a couple tiels or conjures. I am very happy with this cage!  Luckily, my husband had it put together before I even got home, so I can't speak to assembly, but it is VERY sturdy and well-made.  I was looking at cages in a national pet store chain the day before this came, saw one I really liked because it was exactly what I wanted, but it was $229.  When I got home -- well, if this isn't the exact same cage, it's close! ", "I love everything about this cage it is very sturdyeverything screws in keeping all pieces together tightly it's well made smooth all pieces so my babies can not be injured. I am 74 years old never put a bird cage together before had mo problem. very good instructions step by step numbered with a picture.all screws the same size.this cage is excellent quality worth $300.00 I will buy from this company again.my birds were so happy they were singing away in 24  hours Thank you Amazon After reading some of the reviews I was iffy on how this product would come in. One of the brackets was broken (I do not know which one because my husband put it together and said I would never find it.) Some of the bar sheets are a little bent. Not anything you can't fix. When putting on a perch I broke a bar, just at the weld but that is because this cage is for small/medium birds and I was pushing on it my husband said to just put it back where it was welded and leave it alone. I love the doors, the food dishes are hard to get on, but they have perches attached and well easy to go on means easy to get off for the birds. My finches love their new home, I put newspaper at the bottom because finches love to eat off the ground and I wanted to make sure they could. The pull out cage bottom (not the tray) is not a pull out but a wrench out. Way to difficult so my husband will be taking it out for me. Putting it together is difficult (according to my husband) he said nothing was labeled but on the directions they were. But I knew that, remember use common sense. The bars are not as sturdy as the other cage I have, but the other cage is for a larger bird. I adore this cage, although it has it's flaws it is a good looking cage and I would recommend you get it. The doors are plenty strong enough for small/medium birds and I do not see them escaping, although if you have a cat you may want to find other means to keep them closed. The front doors bar is a little difficult to line up, but it just takes a little pressure and you can get it in there. Most of the negative reviews are true, although I find they may have expected a perfect cage which as we all know perfection does not exist, and some of them over exxagarated the flaw. It is not at all bad! I got this for my quaker parrot when he outgrew his baby cage. This thing is huge! I probably could've gotten the smaller size but he loves it. The metal was bent a little which made assembly a little difficult but overall love it! Long story short I really needed to have this together in time only to find out the hard way that part B2 was missing and was not included in my order. B2 is the entire back part of the top back half of the cage. Without it you can't finish the cage. Love the new cage once put together it's solid and sturdy. Had all the parts nothing was bent or broken glad I got this one and my birds love it one moment there up top the next there on the bottom didn't use wire bottom birds like to play with news paper on bottom I just change every day or two I love the mobility about it, i love the height of it,  i love the width of it, want to order another, but hubby says no and H---,No, i hate that it took 2 hours in total  time, but 3 days to complete because the  Frustration, Pain in the as-, The cussing, At the cage and at each other was not fun putting together. The feeder cup doesnt fit well, but now that it is built i love it and so does the my birds This is nice size cage however it was built poorly - had to drill holes to make it go together correctly- also would be nice if they would label the parts so it would be easier to figure out how it all goes together- someone who maybe doesn\u2019t have tools to fix the issues would be returning the cage. Not sure how cage made it through inspection The cage came in great condition, fairly easy to set up, we have 4 parakeets and they love their new enclosure. Plenty of space for them. I gave this 4 stars because 2 of the 4 dishes came broken and amazon will not just replace those 2 dishes but would replace the whole cage, dishes, etc. It isnt worth the hassle to take down this cage down that my birds are already settled in for 2 dishes. Im disappointed that replacement parts arent available but happy with the cage and feel like its worth the money! Great product even greater price! Perfect for my two sugar gliders. Plenty of room to set up toys and branches. Easy access to food and easy to keep clean. Excellent value for the money! I would have expected to pay almost triple for what I received! I got an even better deal because I purchased from the warehouse. a cool cage for such a price, it\u2019s easy to assemble, disassemble, when moving it can be sorted out by folding it into its own box, I absolutely recommend it, I am not a friend or relative of this seller, I just like to tell the truth what it is! Thank you guys for the goods and for the accurate delivery, the goods reached in general and safety! ", "I LOVE this cage....economical, and a great value for the price.  I Love that it has so many doors...Since it\u2019s so big, having the 2 big doors as well as 8 smaller doors makes cleaning and setting up a breeze!  I would highly recommend Ultimately, this cage has been great! What a great value for this cage. The breeder wanted twice this amount. I love all the doors. My conure stays at the top but I feel better with him having such a big cage. It rolls easy and comes with everything needed to get your bird's home ready..just add some toys. Very happy with the spacing as well. He stays safe and secure. Back story: I acquired a Sun Conure (named Calvin Edwin Ripken III) after a friend found him released in her apartment complex and his cage at the dumpster. It was a nice cage, so we took it, cleaned it up and put some new toys in it for him. However, he still seemed a little unhappy, so my boyfriend and I decided to start looking for a new cage for the boy. I just got my first of the two cages, hell yea! this was a very good buy in my opinion.  The cages are incredibly sturdy and quite large! for the price this would be the best product i could ever tell someone about.  i have two pairs of sugar gliders that are going in them and the first of the two are extremely happy in their new home.  I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE! Purchased this item with high hopes for a new enclosure for my Sugar Gliders. But sadly this cage did not meet my expectations. The bars are very flimsy. My SG was able to bend them and get out. These are juvi SG 2.. so maybe 3oz.. Second it says that its 1/2\u201d spacing. Which holds through for the bars themselves but in the corners have a 3/4 or greater gap which is plenty for a SG to get out. Very disappointed in the overall quality. We are contacting the seller today. None I have several finches, and purchased two of these cages; the first was a real bargain at only $100, but the next one was $135....saw it for $120 the day after it was ordered, but they would not give me that price. That was a bummer. But, the cages are great, and easily assembled; they look nice. One improvement would be to have a smaller slide opening within the front door of the cage....I am nervous about opening the door all the way.....the door comes in handy sometimes, but for changing food, etc., a slider would be better. The side doors are helpful. I even separated one of the cages into two sections by cutting a piece of cardboard and cutting in notches and then slid it into place. It worked....needed to separate some birds at the time, but using it as one again. Surprisingly sturdy and good looking for the price. I received this cage and assembled it a couple days ago. I wanted a larger cage for our finches. This shipment was packaged well and received with no damage. All of the parts were there. The instructions could use a little more detail on identifying the components, but it really was not hard to put together. Took me around 40 minutes.This is a large cage, but its light; which is good for me because I move it out to the patio and back into the house a lot. I really like this cage. It's very roomy in both width and depth. I currently have 2 Green Cheek Conures housed in it which will hopefully breed in the Spring. That will put me at six or so birds. There will still be a good amount of room. ", "I\u2019ve read reviews, some say it was hard to put together, I didn\u2019t think so for it is a big bird cage you will probably need a extra set of hands.. Wow, really happy with this cage! Although I wouldn't describe this as a true white (it's more of an off white color - I included a photo showing it against the white trim in my house for comparison) I'm still very happy with the purchase. I got this for my parrotlet, and while he's had a nicely sized cage for years, I have always felt badly that he didn't have a larger one to enjoy for the times when he can't be outside of his cage (and it can be tough to find large cages with appropriate 1/2\" bar spacing or less). He LOVES his new digs though I think I'll need to get him a few more toys now to help furnish his space a bit more! (It's such a large space for him - he looks as though he's got his own personal apartment building and this makes us both beyond happy!!) This is a fantastic birdcage for the money.  Cages sold in big box stores are a similar price, but a tiny fraction of the size.  Seriously, this cage is huge and I love it.  I've noticed that other reviews complained that assembly instructions were not included, but I did get instructions with mine.  The only thing I would like to see improved are the doors on the front of the cage.  They're a bit small, and the sliders stick a little, causing the cage to jostle (startling the birds) when opened.  Otherwise, amazing cage for a great price!! Bars are very thin and flimsy and bend easily.  In fact one bar was bent when we unpacked it.  We did not assemble it at that point and decided to return it.  Unfortunately, we missed the return window by one day.  Door opening is very wide, but a clever mid-sized parrot can easily figure out how to open it.  I would never use as a cage for unsupervised use due to quality and possibility of escape.  We did not assemble it at that point and decided to return it.  Unfortunately, we missed the return window by one day. These give a good amount of room, easy to move around if needed, and easy to clean. Plus the price is extremely reasonable! Lots of doors to access the inside. My only teeny complaint would be that they must come from different manufacturers and some cages have better door latches than others. I bought 2 and one has a wonderful secure latch and one has a difficult latch. This would not stop me from ordering though because the good outweighs this feature. This is great for the price. Sure I may not have much experience, but for what you pay for, you sure get a lot! The cage is made very flimsy. The weld points don\u2019t hold up at all. Some literally broke during installation. The cage also came bent, they quickly shipped me out another one but that was also the same so I returned it. Got this cage for an awesome price.  And all of Prevue's products are awesome.  Only one tiny complaint.  As these cages are mass made, they are not always perfect.  I've worked in pet stores, and owned birds for years.  So I have put together my fair share of Prevue cages.  And every once in a while, you come across one that just doesn't quite fit exactly together the right way.  On this one, there is one screw that will just NOT go in all the way.  But the cage is still sturdy enough and safe enough for my budgies, so it's fine.  I definitely recommend all of Prevue's products. Love this cage. I have 2 budgies and I might get two more. I got the XL. I put it together by myself in less than an hour. Used twist tied to temp hold pieces so didn't need and extra set of hands. Easy to assemble. All the parts were in good condition. Nothing broken or bent. Such a great bargain! We're very happy with this cage (bought for a nanday conure). Solid construction, nice finish, lots of utility. Some blobby welds and other glitches, but the finished cage is handsome. Now we're working on the feng shui. :) ", "The cage is very roomy and nice quality. I would have given it a 5 star if it was about 10\" higher from the floor. I have a dog and my canary is a bit scared to come down to his bath when she is around. I have another cage that is higher up and the birds don't seem to mind the dog walking by. The packaging was fine. All the pieces came in good shape. I've had a great experience with this cage.  Been using it for 3 years now, it houses one cockatiel.  My favorite feature is the ease of rolling it around, as I move it from room to room daily, multiple times a day.  Very easy to clean as well, and has been very secure.  I've had cats on occasion jump on the cage on the side and hang there, and have had them on top of the cage, and the cage has always held up to that stress. I'd highly recommend it. I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet. I just got a single bird at the moment, moved him from a really small cage into this MASSIVE cage. It was awesome, because at first he didn't know what to think!!! He had all this room to do what ever he want plus a new little nest box I bought for him. I am very satisfied that my bird is satisfied. This cage could hold quit a few birds and nests for them all. I plan to get my bird a buddy soon to play with and make lots of noise with hahaha!! Also this is a quality cage, I thought it would be flimsy and what not but that's not the case. The dogs liked to jump up at first but they got over it when they couldn't get in, although if you got a big aggresive dog he might be able to pull it down if he is smart. I got a couple min-pins and a chuauauaua I can even spell it lol. GREAT PRICE, GREAT BUY, YOUR BIRD(S) WILL BE HAPPY! This cage is very sturdy and a great size for my 3 parakeets and 1 canary.  It was easy to put together, nothing was bent.  I like the spring-held doors, I don't think a small bird could possibly open them. The front doors are very easy to open and latch securely. I do wish the cage's legs were about 5 inches longer, but that's my only complaint. I was a bit unsure with this type of purchase as to quality and ease of assembly. I am happy to say that it was an absolute steal at the price. The packaging was very reliable with corner protection and lots of padding to protect during shipment. I house my Lady Gouldian finches in this and it\u2019s great. Plenty of room to fly and to attach perches. The spring doors would be pretty easy to open for larger or more curious birds, so that\u2019s a note of caution. On the up side, they are very handy for moving things around and getting feeding trays in and out. Assembly instructions were easy to follow and while I did most of it by myself, my husband helped when I needed something stabilized until I could get the screws attached. I would buy another down the road if my flock grows. My bird loves his new space! Great quality for a reasonable price So it\u2019s big and pretty nice. Using for my ratties. Problem is- broken tray, smashed perches and broken water/food trays. Called amazon and they gave us a VERY small discount. I didn\u2019t  want to disassemble so I took it. I really wish they would have just sent us a new bottom tray. I could have lived without the perch and other trays. Just hate paying this price and now I have duct tape all over it : (. My cage came very quickly since I have prime membership. It arrive two business days after I bought it. I was pretty ill with a cold but decided that my sugar gliders deserved to have fun in their new cage, so I assembled it that night. I almost gave up three separate times, but I managed to assemble it by myself in a few hours. Some of the bars did need to be bent in order to fit correctly, which it mentions in the instructions. Aside from that, assembling the cage was fairly straightforward. Would've been tons easier having someone hold the opposite side steady while I worked on it, since this cage could technically fit me inside it. I'm very happy with my purchase and my gliders love their new home. ", "All the reviews warn of missing pieces & horrible instructions.  TRUE!!!  2 of the 4 food/water bowls were broken.  The instructions were nearly useless as the parts did not have ANY corresponding labels.  In the end, I have a decent birdcage (w lopsided supports as I was trying match pix to the piece), 2 feeders, a slide out cleaning tray in the back, instead of the front. It took some time to put together but the assembly over all wasn't too bad. The build quality is pretty good but there were a few pieces that I had to bend back into shape with pliers luckily nothing dangerous for the birds so I went a head and kept the cage. The head of the screws also seems to strip easily and the hex tool they send with it also tends to strip even when you are not applying that much pressure. Despite all these defects, the cage is better than any cage I have seen from a main stream pet store. Like so many others, I think this cage is a terrific bargain.  It's hard to find an affordable cage this large, with this bar spacing (for small birds), at such a low price.  I have 4 budgies in mine, 2 small American budgies, a very large English budgie, and an English/American cross and there is ample room for more birds.  The convenience of the large front doors, coupled with the smaller spring-loaded side doors makes cleaning,changing food stations,and hanging toys very easy.  It is pretty good quality although even though it's on wheels, I won't be wheeling it around much. When it moves, it tends to bow a little on it's frame. My birds love it and use all the space inside- even the low areas, since it's easy to set up enticing toys down low as well as up high.We purchased a wooden ladder for about $5 that we have place on the bottom door, so when it's open, the birds with clipped wings can come and go as they please, but they like it so much, they rarely are interested in coming out. Prior to getting this cage, our birds were paired up in two smaller cages. We had two that didn't get along at all, but they are cohabiting peacefully now as there is plenty of room to stay out of each other's way. Highly recommend. Easy to assemble. Love the look and feel of the paint. Received it with a small missing piece, but contacted the manufacturer directly and they were nice enough to send it to me and save me the trouble of taking it apart, return it, and order another one. It\u2019s a nice cage for small birds.  I have two parakeets and they enjoy the large space.  It is not easy to put together (you need a helper) and it seems a bit flimsy.  You definitely would not put a bird in it that chews a lot or is very clever.  I think they might figure out how to get out.  For my needs it was perfect and the prices was right. I love this cage.  It is exactly as I expected and was very easy to assemble with the instructions.  It came quickly with no damage.  I liked it so much I purchased a second one, took out the side panels on both, and connected them with cable ties to create one huge flight cage for my pair of ringneck doves.  It is still easy to move to vacuum around.  I removed the bottom grate and put the tray in its slot so that my birds are on a solid surface.  One thing of note: the bars on the cage are flimsy and would probably not stand up to a strong beak/strong chewer. I've been a rat owner for a little over a year.  I've been through two cages in that time. I just got this cage yesterday since it was more ideal for my bedroom. It fit perfectly into the corner where I usually keep my cages at. the cage came decently packaged in a some what heavy box, it had the corners of the box guarded by additional cardboard. Each of the cage parts were wrapped individually in thin plastic, even though I'd recommend using bubble wrap in addition to the thin plastic in your boxes next time Prevue, it would make more sense. Nothing came broken, which I was surprised with the lack of cushion inside.  It came with instructions, but they didn't make too much sense because the images were small. Without the instructions it took me about 30 minutes to assemble. The cage is somewhat flimsy in structure when you want to move it around. Mine came with only two minor blemishes. one minor (rust?) spot and a weak weld on the stand. Even though I'm not using it for birds, on of the feeder doors won't even open, it seems to be welded shut(saved me a zip tie at least.) I would give this ten stars if I could. It does take two smart people to build though! Probably twenty minutes. Needs to have individual pieces marked so you don't have to keep taking it apart when you put the piece in wrong place! My finches love it! It's tall and rolls around easily to move and clean around. And $ is so reasonable! This cage is great!! Our sugar gliders love it. We get up in the middle of the night and sugar gliders are bouncing all around. However, the plastic food dishes are kind of cheap. We broke ours trying to put them in the actual cage. Its nice that you get a few with the cage. The cage arrived on time and on perfect condition. All parts were there and the instructions were self explanatory. It is easier for two people to put together and took about 46 minutes. No warping, no sharp edges, no kidding hardware. I am very happy. ", "Short Version: This cage is very well built, inexpensive, and to my delight, it has removable end panels so that two cages (or more can be added) can be joined together easily and nearly seamlessly by using black plastic cable ties and omitting one set of wheels at the join to create a six foot flight cage. I ended up buying three of these cages. The third, I lashed to the front of the second at right angles.  By not adding the end panels of the third cage at the end to be joined, and leaving the large front cage doors of the second cage opened, it adds another three feet of flight space, beautifully fits the corner of my room, is visually more interesting to look at, and is a big hit with my Finches offering them more flight path variety and interest. Easy to assemble. Did all by myself. Didn't need a 2nd person. Very sturdy. Just becareful not to strip any bolts with the allen wrench. Only comes with 1 extra bolt. Don't ober tighten. Just enough where it's snugged. Good quality. My birds loved it. Only have 2 at the moment. Buying 3 more soon! Great birdcage BUT the bottom of the cage is too big for cat to reach for bird's tail and wing. Don't ask. I am telling for those who have cat that this cage isn't 100% cat proof. If you put a thin chicken wire in the bottom, you have a better safety protection. The plastic tray melts VERY easily. Woop! The electric heater melted it! I did lots of research before buying this cage. It's the perfect size for my pair of indian ringnecks. You can attach a nest box, I just zip tied back the feeder door. You do need to secure all the feeder doors, as they can easily open them. I zip tied the ones I won't use often and got small clips for the others. My Lovies are comfy in it. I had an issue assembling it. There was one hole that did not match up so I couldn\u2019t put a screw in it. I tried explaining it to amazon but they said I would have to send the whole cage back to company. It weighs a lot so I decided to improvise. Otherwise i would give 5 stars... Awesome cage, easy to open doors and plenty of them.  Wasn't hard to assemble either..but I've assembled a few birdcages before this.  More than adequate room for my little flock of 6 budgerigars.  My only wish is that the wheels were a bit bigger/more heavy duty..but the wheels it comes with are technically just fine, so it's not worth docking a star. After the hurricane in Florida, we ended up with 3 baby squirrels and their eyes were not yet open.  We purchased this cage for them as we knew that they would eventually start running around.  We loved it and so did they.  They are now out in the big trees, but come back for petting and a good scratch. Alright I've had this cage long enough to say I love it. Assembling wasn't difficult but it did need two people for one part of the assembling. My lovebird enjoys the cage as he now has so much room for all sorts of toys. At night he goes in and sleeps I don't have to coax him in. The bars can be a bit flimsy but they aren't bad. I also wheel the cage at night to another room and the wheels havent failed me yet. Really need two people to assemble. ", "So... To be honest, I don't use this cage, it was a present. I can tell you about their experience, however. This Is an excellent, attractive, lightweight but roomy cage for one or more small to medium birds  at a remarkably reasonable price.  My husband and I just finished putting it together this morning.  The instructions were well written and illustrated, and we had no problems with assembly.  The materials seem top quality.  We have a Hahn's Macaw, who took to the cage almost immediately.  Bird and owners very satisfied. I purchased this cage to upgrade my birds to a new one and to make it easier for me to clean. It\u2019s worth what I paid. However, the instructions weren\u2019t clear and parts weren\u2019t labeled. So we installed some panels backwards and had to restart. A wire piece was not cut out properly so we had to take some wire cutters and fix that. The bowls arrived damaged, so this cage can be a hit or miss. My prevue hendryx black flight cage came with several snapped bars a very cracked/broken plastic tray and 2 broken food/water dishes, i would very much appreciate a replacement flight cage please. Very good cage for the price. We a little concerned about the doors and might buy latches to make sure they stay closed. The side doors make feeding and watering is a breeze but we had to watch the placement of some accessories due to those doors. Our parakeet love to fly around in it and have been very happy with it.  All in all we are very happy with it. I bought this for my cockatiel, just because his cage was over 20 years old, and it was the same price as the tiny ones the pet store was selling.  Once I put him in it, I thought \"overkill, it's TOO much room\".  It looked like he was living in an empty castle.  I put in some branches and toys, and now it's not too bad, but he will never see the bottom half of this cage.  But if you have finches or parakeets that move around a lot, that bottom half is even more valuable. The top cover came in bent, one of the screws had no place to use an Allen wrench. Putting it together was not the best of experiences. I need another cage but I doubt I'll be buying this same one again. I would not recommend it. Too much money for the stress of having to fix these things on my own Excellent cage! Easy to assemble and provides so much room!! Using it as an outside cage for my panther chameleon! He loves it! Only drawback is the little doors which don\u2019t have locks on them so we just put breadties on them. The cage over all is grate. However the quality control is not there. The legs have 3 holes on the top to lock in extended  cage wires. One of the legs I receives had the holes on the side so I had to drill holes on the top. Also a few of the bolt holes were not tapped correctly so it took added time to get the cage together. If you plane on using it for a larger bird @ a small parrot you need to secure the side doors as they can be pushed open with out to mush pressure. I have 4 parakeets and this is more than big enough. I even put it together all by myself, and that\u2019s saying something. I love that I can wheel the cage around and even take it outside if I want to. ", "My cockatiel loves this cage. I have never kept her in a cage before. She had free roam in my Florida room for 10 years. I got tired of cleaning poop every weekend! So I bought this for her and she loves it. I purchased this for my budgie (parakeet), and I really like it.  It was really hard to put together, but I guess that means its durable! A tad flimsy and has some bends in the wire but I really like this cage and would buy again if needed,. I have 2 cockatiels in it and there is plenty of space for them, toys, and perches. My husband and I put up the cage. Couldn't figure out one piece in particular that took us half hour to figure out which piece it was. The birds love the cage and I am very satisified with it. It did come with a couple of bent pieces which I am sure is from shipping but it was easy to bend it back to shape. THe birds totally enjoy climbing up and down. They visit the cat down at the bottom and go back to the top for feeding and playing. Lots of toys in the cage and I do not have to worry about all the toys getting dirty so fast. Very roomy and they fly around a bit in the cage. I have two cockatiels and one parakeet in the cage. I've had this cage for a year and eight months.  I like it; my birds (two parakeets and a dove) like it.  I might even get another one.  There are a couple of things you might want to know.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can't change the seed and water cups without opening the doors and reaching inside the cage.  This could entail a slight risk of a bird escaping, although this hasn't happened to me.  After a lot of use the plastic tray at the bottom became warped and would know longer stay in place.  I took it out and cut a piece of artificial turf and put it in the bottom of the cage.  This isn't a wholly satisfactory fix. We picked up this cage for our Sugar Gliders and I can't say there's anything I'd change. We have used this cage for a few weeks.  Moving it (rolling it) from wood floors to tile throughout the day.  Stays together and moves easily.  Perfect for our Parakeet, plenty of room to fly around I bought two parakeets in January and noticed they didn't seem happy in their cage. So I went bigger. They LOVE this! They fly and play and sing, they love it. It's huge and has room for almost 4 or 5 comfortable parakeets I'd say. I'm buying another parakeet tomorrow. One of the pictures shows more than 4 but I want mine to have lots of room.You will need 2 people to put this together. One person to hold it in place and the other to put the screws in place. It took me and my mom about an hour to put it together. Maybe less. It's very stable. I also love how easily the tray comes out to clean the cage. Good buy! Well worth the price. This is a great cage!  So inexpensive for the high quality materials.  Construction was easy (I did it alone with very little trouble) and the cage is not only very attractive and sturdy-looking, but is also sooooo much easier to keep clean than the old cage my lovebirds had.  Before, they were basically so close to the edges of the cage that food was always spilling out onto my floor and the sides of the cage would get pooped on.  It was considered an average cage for 2 lovebirds, too.  This cage, however, seems to be a MUCH more reasonable size for them.  It stays so much cleaner because they aren't cramped into such small quarters.  It probably also helps that it's lower than the old cage, so the inevitably messy bottom of the cage (even one hour after I've cleaned it, the cage bottom looks atrocious because of all the scattered seeds and poop and paper that my little girl shreds as soon as I replace it) is almost too low to be noticeable.  I love the size and construction of this cage and the food trays that come with it are really nice and sturdy.  Can't say enough about the quality of this cage, especially for the price.  The birds have SO much room to spread out!  It's so nice to see them actually fly a little and to be able to fully spread their wings both at the same time.  Seeing my happy birds chirping away in their new space makes me happy :) I Have nothing to complain, but you will need extra hand to assemble, but pretty easy to put together after that you will have this nice,spacious cage for my finches, they love it very much without a doubt! I added a house plants around it, OMG no word is needed!!! ", "I'm wondering what else I could use this cage for. It's really big and I'm going to use it for finches, but I think it would work well for conures too. Maybe it could be modified to fit a ferret or even rats? I ordered the large version and am really happy with it. The top panel was bent, but that had to do with shipping, not Amazon. Prevue has made outstanding bird cages for years and this one does not disappoint. Have a second person to make setting up the cage a breeze and be sure to assemble the panels IN ORDER so that everything lines up properly. Just check for burrs (rough metal along the metal bars I didn't have any) and check the screw holes for metal flakes that prevent the screw from going through (I had 1 like that). Other than that, I absolutely love it. There are plenty of doors (6 side doors total and 2 front doors) it comes with 3 wood perches (preferably for a cockatiel or something similar in size) and 4 water/food bowls. It's very easy to put together (have at least 2 People) it's bigger than I expected and I'm glad it was. Perfect cage. My canary is soooooo happy. That makes me happy. This cage exceeded my expectations. It's quite large and is definitely a much better quality than I thought it would be for the low price. It's very sturdy, and my sugar glider is having fun exploring it. I will likely add another sugar glider soon. This cage is a terrific budget item for several small birds or a medium sized parrot. We purchased it to house some budgies who were surrendered to our rescue without a proper cage. The cage is easy to clean and has multiple access points. There is also ample room for toy placement and enrichment items. It took about an hour for two people to assemble. We did manage to put the slide-out bottom tray in backward but it didn't bother us enough to disassemble it and start over! Great cage for the price! Fast shipping! Big roomy and well-made. The 3 perches are all the same size and for larger birds than my canary, so I\u2019ll get a few smaller perches and angle one or two across corners. Mine came with 2 white plastic divided feeders which hook onto the bars. Quite pleased- lots of room for many more canaries too! I bought this cage in late July 2012.  I really like the design and looks of the cage.  The doors are very convenient and are logically placed. This cage is the home of a pair of Gouldian finches.  A nest box fits perfectly at one of the uppermost side doors.  The only problem that I have with this cage is that with only 3 months of use, it is RUSTING in several places including some weld seams.  I am very disappointed.  Even those cheap \"knock-down\" cages don't rust until after years of use.  I would caution anyone considering this cage to include the rust potential in your decision.  I wouldn't buy it had I known. This cage is well made. It is easy to clean with a slide out tray/floor. My cage arrived with tabs broken on two of the four food/water bowls and Prevue Pet Products replaced them. The new bowls seem to be made from a different plastic. I really like having the cage on wheels to make cleaning up after my messy cockatiels less of a chore. The cage is very nice and roomy, 2 things need improvement: ", "This cage came in the mail and it was a lot larger than I expected. The assembly took some time, but it wasn't difficult. It's a very spacious cage and it's pretty good quality. The plastic bird feeder bins that come with the cage don't last long. The hooks where the bins hang onto the cage are also plastic and can break easily if not handled with care. That's not a big deal though because you can always purchase different bird feeders to put in your cage. The cage came in good condition although I did notice a spot where the cage was a little bent. I have 9 parakeets and they have more than enough room in this cage. If ever I were to need another cage I would not hesitate to buy this one again! A bit cumbersome to assemble.  Requires two people.  I think I confused this with another cage sold on Amazon that had metal shelves.  This just has the large full length perches, which aren't the best for small birds.  Bottom of cage sits lower than I thought.  But generally once assembled it works fairly well.  It's light and easy to move for cleaning, putting the birds outside, etc.  Reasonably large for small birds.  I have to cockatiels and a parakeet in mine and they seem comfortable. It was delivered today as expected.  It arrived in perfect condition.  All pieces were present including the windbell lock and screw which was already attached.  It is easy for two people to assemble.  The feeding trays are large, perfect for this large cage.  One tray was cracked but it comes with four so this is not a  problem.  I have three parakeets and now have room for several more.  This is an excellent birdcage and a great price for the size and quality.  I couldn't be more pleased. For the price, it's a good cage. The quality of the cage is poor but again, what can you expect for the price. The directions are not very clear because none of the pieces are labeled. You'll end up putting the cage together and then realizing a piece is backwards and having to take it apart to try again. The cage wires were warped and bent and I had to use pliers to bend everything to get it to fit. If you're looking for something cheap, this is the way to go. If you're looking for quality, I would go else where. I was a little leary about buying this after reading some of the reviews on the assembly and missing holes; but the price was too hard to resist.  I received it yesterday, and assembled it by myself with no difficulty. The instructions were clear enough; but it would have been easier if they had put labels on the parts. The bird cage is very sturdy and easy to assemble. I like the cage and love the rollers.  The plastic feeding cups are an unusual size and have to be special ordered as they broke during shipping. I'm not going to send back the entire cage for the feeding cups. My four parakeets are thrilled to death to be living in this cage.  It's wonderful!  It's the size of a parrot cage with the bar spacing of a keet cage.  Exactly what I wanted.  The one thing that I would change is that the food doors open sideways instead of up and down and it can be difficult to find baths and things that fit this style.  However, this is my favorite purchase of the year.  Great price, fantastic cage.... do beware the bedding tray, though.... it doesn't fit well and sometimes falls out, making a mess. Great company with great customer service so makes it an even better buy but really nice cafe we have it for four finches and even with all the perches they fly all around I love this cage, it is just the size i wanted. I had to look at the reviews beofr buying it and i love when people post pics of theirs. The o ly thing wrong with the cage is that the pieces where slightly bent but it wasnt much of an issue. Only a perfection freak would see a problem with that. Its easy to put together but alittle confusing too. My birds love it. I do like how the wheels are kinda gliddy. I also like the 8 doors that helps alot. 5 star if it wasnt bent/bowed a bit. Arrived packaged well with extra measures to assure no wires were bent.  Directions were scant but we managed to put it together in less than an hour.  Certianly easier with 2 people. Large cage is great for my middle sized African Red Bellied parrot.  Food dishes are a little flimsy so I will be replacing with stainless steel.  Spring loaded doors will require extra security for smart birds and I will fix this with thumb clips to prevent accidental escapes!\u00a0 ", "Awesome cage !! It was bought for my lovebird and she loves it !!! The only issue was that one of the food bowls was cracked. I wish I could exchange it but I am not sure if I can do that without returning the whole thing that is already together. It was a bit time consuming to put it together but very worth it !! Highly recommended. Great flying room for her ! We like the cage, and our birds are enjoying it. The Four plastic double cups came with the plastic pieces that hold them m in place a little loose so when you try putting them on the cage they break. I had to go and buy others at a store near by. The I love the flight cage, the problem is that the parts were so badly protected during shipping. I believe it would be the box the manufacturer packed the product in. There was virtually no protection around any of the pieces in the box. bars were bent, panels were bent and a food dish was broken.  Because the panels were bent it took forever to put the cage together because when you were trying to secure the panels they kept popping out of place. If you put the poor packaging to the side and look at the cage itself it's just an ok buy. The  birds love it, we have 21 finches and they are flying all over the place. The perches they provide are good. At first I thought they might be too large for the finches but they are using them very easily. A real negitve are the doors. It sounds great when you hear they will shut automatically because they use springs in the doors, the problem is if the springs fail the door isnt going to stay shut at all.  These doors are located on the two ends of the cage both in the lower and upper part of the cage. This is a big plus, you have easy access to the inside of the cage to  put food and water dishes in, the negitive is you can only reach in so far and then you have to use one on the two doors they have in front which are poorly designed. It uses the type of closer where you run a small bar down the side of the door that goes through little holes to keep the door shut, they leave very little left after the last hole and the bar at the top you have to turn and move the rounded bar through a hole. Im not discribing it very well but its not convieniant nor do I like how loose it is. This item is exactly as described.  We did match up the panels correctly, but there were some of the holes/wires off by the tiniest of space.  One wire had to be bent to fit into the hole, but we got it together.  Very sturdy cage and my birds love it.  The plastic feeder trays included are not very durable.  One of the tabs that attaches it to the wires has already broken off.  The large waste collection tray at the bottom is more flexible than expected.  You must support it well when you remove it or it will twist and dump the contents into the floor.  I love the wheels.  It is awesome to be able to easily move the cage around.  I definitely would recommend purchasing this cage.  At this price, a couple of small issues are excusable. I love this cage! Pretty easy to assemble. Very sturdy. I have 6 parakeets (budgies) & there's a lot of room for them now to fly around & play. I love that I can roll this on the carpet to vacuum where the birds have made a mess or just move them anywhere in the house. Very easy to just wipe clean. My only issue I have is when I received the item & I opened it & took everything out of the box to assemble it, 1 of the 4 plastic feeder/water contains had a piece broke off it where it clips to the cage. The clips fitted very tight & made it hard to take the water dish out to clean without spilling water all over so I cut the bars on the cage so it fits better. Other then that, it's perfect! Thank you!!! Easy to put together.  All parts where there and nothing was bent. This cage is the way to go for economy . It is roomy. The doors nice sized but the design of the drop pin is simplistic and a hassle especially if you have an escape artist. Tried using for a Quaker and she figured out how to get out regardless of how any clips I tried to use. I ended up giving it to the cockatiels instead. They size is generous but needs a little fine tuning for smaller puzzle loving birds. I would rate higher if the doors had a differnt latch system. I still think it's a good affordable cage for less inquisitive birds but know your bird before you decide if the door latches will work for you. My two parrotlets love it and they are so much happier in a roomy cage that I don't feel so guilty.  When they say it needs to two people to assemble - it does - unless you are three handed and ambidexterous.  It has a good placement of doors and feeders. I would have given this a 5 star, because the whole thing went together easily and is very good craftsmanship, however one of the plastic feeders came broken.  Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this. I'll change my review to a 5 star if they replace the item. This is a good size and my bird loves it.  I wish the big doors had latches on them.  The device there is kind of cheaply made and you need to make sure that the little metal pole goes into the loop to lock it shut (per se).  That is my only issue.  I like the size, it wasnt too bad to put together and the ease of cleaning is wonderful.  The bottom tray slides out but so does the grate.  Easy to wipe down.  Good cage overall. ", "Went together easily and yes I did it myself.  (it would be easier with 2 people).  Easy to clean and my sugar gliders love it.  Lots of door openings but I locked all down but front and I've had no escapes, except when I forget to close the door.  Rolls easily and takes up minimal space. I was nervous after reading so many negative reviews, but I had no problems! It came packaged nicely and all pieces in perfect condition. I had no issues putting it together with the help of another person and it's very sturdy! I decided to take the bottom sliding grate and modify it as middle floor by cutting off the handle and a section of bars, and then wiring it all securely. I used cooling racks that I already owned as levels, and then used the levels from their old cage as ramps. The appeal of this cage, besides the size, is that I can customize it many ways to suit my needs. Overall a great purchase and my 3 little ratties absolutely love their new home! I really like this cage. I know the dimensions were on it, and I thought I had an idea how big this was- but it was bigger than I expected. It is great. I have one budgie now, but he will be getting some friends soon and they should all have plenty of room, even with plenty of toys. I don't understand how anyone could have a difficult time putting this cage together. It does take two people, but it took us like 15 to 20 minutes to put together. The cage is very sturdy and my finches have a lot of room to fly! I'm extremely happy with my purchase!! I'll start by saying that I doubt you'll find a cage this size for such a great price. We've had this cage for almost 6 months and it has held up very well with the exception of the food/water cups. Two of them were broken when the cage arrived and one broke a couple of months later. The cage houses our 3 parakeets with plenty of space and is easy to clean. We have had no problems with the bottom tray sliding out easily and it stays in place without a problem. It was $25.00 less when I purchased it, which made it a better value. I would definitely recommend this cage if you need more space for your birds, but cannot afford to break the budget to do so. After reading reviews I was worried about assembly- but actually it was easy! Took about thirty minutes. Pieces all in good condition. Great size cage for my parakeets. This cage is affordable and huge.  We got a baby 8 week old parakeet  and put him in this cage. It took a few weeks to get used to the size. He came from a really small shared cage.  He is one happy bird now. He has room to fly around and I have room to put multiple big bird toys in the cage. Even with all the toys, perches, and food dishes he has room to fly around. The family dog has jumped on the cage daily and it still holds up.  The cage has wheels and is easily rolled around to move from room to room or just roll to clean the floor. It is easy to clean.  Everyone who sees the bird and its home comment on how he is one spoiled bird. Isn't that how it should be. It is hard to assemble. It is not that you can't figure how to do it, but that it is badly manufactured and some of the pieces simply won't fit into each other, I gave up and wanted to send it back, but my buddy was able to fit them with some extra force. Bird approved it though, from when we were struggling to assemble it, and went inside as soon as it was finished, on his own, and made lots of happy noises. Bar spacing is too small, should be good for much smaller birds than ours, we have a maroon-bellied conure. Really like this cage for my parakeet. He looks so small in it, but love that he has so much room. This would probably  be good if you have a larger bird like a cockatiel also. Had a few burrs on some bars but filed down with a fingernail file and touched up with non toxic acrylic paint. Otherwise, wonderful product so far. ", "Okay I admit when we first purchased this flight cage, I didn't think it was quite as big as it was. e found this one priced lower than some cages that were smaller and decided this was the best for our buck! I am really happy with the price. The food dishes are junk. Two have broken in the first week. Overall build is a little cheesy but I expected that for the price. It is big and my budgie and cockatiel have plenty of room. The lack of horizontal bars keeps my little retards from climbing and encourages flight but makes it hard to make a toy end up in just the right spot. I bought clips to keep the spring loaded doors shut because they open by pressure from the inside instead of out... which to me is stupid. If a bird hits it hard enough, it will open. This cage is awesome! I own two parakeets and they both love it! I've had it for maybe a month and a half now and it's still in super good condition. Very sturdy and easy to clean. The set up wasn't too bad. Some of the screws weren't going in, but after I figured that out, it turned out great. I'm very happy with this product. We got this for my daughters Sun Conure! It is an excellent cage. Well built. It is very sturdy and her bird has plenty of space! This is a huge bird cage! I love these flight cages  as my African Gray loves to get into everything. Putting it together takes patience and zip-ties. I am short so that made it tough. Overall great cae. I have bought three of these cages over the years and while they get the job done, the quality is simply poor. The cages usually come bent with holes that don't align and crooked threads for the screws. Putting it together is a hassle and once you do it's very hard to disassemble and put back in the box so returning it is very difficult. That said, it gets the job done and has a huge flight area. I would recommend this for small birds like finches so they can fly around inside. Also the cage is kind of an eyesore with it's dark color and ugly wire. For the price though it's probably the best value on the market. Pretty easy to assemble, would have been easier if the parts would have been labeled like the picture in the directions...other than that its huge, i have 6 birds in it and theres plenty of room for more...not a super sturdy cage but not flimsy either... We keep pet rats and the kid was always building castles for them that don't fit in the cage.  Now we have a huge cage that he can build the castles inside and the cats can't bother the critters.  It's very sturdy and nice quality. Easy enough to put together and instructions are clear. Using ours for our sugar gliders and it provides a lot of adjustable room for cage sets. The doors on the side are my only complaint as they are able to be opened through a push/spring door. I ended up zip-tying mine just to be safe. Otherwise this cage is great! Love the storage underneath. I bought this based on the positive reviews.  My one concern was that people repeatedly commented on the lack of assembly directions and that two people were needed for the assembly.  I'm happy to say that while I found the directions less informative than I would have liked they did do the trick.  Also, I put it together all by myself in about an hour.  Two people would certainly make the job easier but it is far from impossible.  It's a great cage and I'm very happy with my purchase. ", "If you're looking for a cheap cage and don't care about things being bent and broken, then this cage is for you! A lot of pieces were bent, some of the pieces didn't have holes in them so you could connect them, and even pieces of the doors broke off. This cage is so fragile I'm afraid to move it downstairs. Would not buy again. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting this cage to be such good quality for such a great price. I got this for my lovebird because he needs lots of room to play and enjoy himself. He is so happy in his cage and he has plenty of room. The only thing is I have had to put zip ties on the side doors because my lovebird is mad strong and can push through the doors. Other than that it\u2019s def worth the price! This cage is perfect for my two cockatiels. Definite takes two people to assemble and about a half hour. When assembling it\u2019s best to leave all screws loose and then tighten once it\u2019s all together. I LOVE this cage. The only downfall being the doors are a little small. So easy to assemble. My 10 year old and I did it without any issues. Plenty of room for my sugar gliders and we have not had an escape yet, (had this cage about 6 months now) Took me 2 days to put it together by myself. Get some help lol. I love the height and sturdiness. Birds are happy. Used for 3 cockatiels. Have to bend over to clean tray though. had i seen this in a store i would have paid double the price. I can't BELIEVE how much value you get. I am really happy i spent a lot of time researching for the best product and boy I found it! Be patient putting together. It took me about an hour and half to get this together especially toward the end when you have to line up the holes and spokes and screw it together at the same time. but it is worth it. VERY PLEASED! I am raising organic-fed quail and this gives them space to fly around when they want to. Easily roll it outside during summer. perfect!! I wish I had realized that the side doors don't stay open - they're spring loaded to stay shut. I have one cockatiel that was not hand trained and will not step up on my hand on command. With the last cage, I was able to \"guide\" her into an open side door with my hand. It's a little trickier trying to use one hand to hold said door open while using the other hand to usher my baby inside. This product came bent, yet the box was not damaged in any way. It absolutely took two people to assemble it. The majority of the metal is extremely flimsy. I purchased this flight cage for my 2 Gouldian Finches a little over 2 months ago. My babies love the huge space they now have! It is very easy to clean. Nothing fancy but for the price-you cant go wrong. It is very sturdy and has wheels so it would be easy to move if needed. The only negative thing I have found is the large feeder containers..they do not fit well between the bars and two have broke because of the bad fit. I am still using the 1 (double compartments)and am looking for a couple other single dishes to offer vegetables in. I am so glad I purchased this cage-Most likely the only cage Oliver and Olivia will ever need :-) No trouble assembling this cage at all. The bird loves his new condo! ", "This cage is a great value!  Assembly instructions could be better.  I assembled it single-handed so it can be done.  The color could better be described as textured dark bronze paint on regular cage wire.  I have finches and this is just great for them to have a lot of flying room.  They really use the entire cage.  There is room for a natural tree branch for them to perch.  I used the small perches from an old cage across the corners.  A clip-on bird bath I had fit in the small doors.  Having multiple doors is really helpful for cleaning and arranging things in the cage.  Your birds will LOVE this cage!!! This is a really good cage for the money. I\u2019ve gone from 8 to 18 parakeets. Breeding like crazy. Needed a bigger cage and this one is perfect! Awesome cage!  After moving our finches, they all hung out around the top section, but within an hour or so they were flying all around the cage.  They seem to chirp a lot more, and can DEFINITELY fly more as their old cage was much too small.  Changing water and food is much easier, and the large dishes are a nice bonus.  In fact, I have even seen our finches bathing in the water dish! This cage is very flimsy and not sturdy at all, especially the doors. Also, the spacing around the rim is more than 1/2 inch. As some others have done, I purchased this for a pair of sugar gliders and they escaped the first night because the opening was larger than it was supposed to be. We had to zip tie plastic chain around all the larger areas so they couldn't get out again while we ordered a better cage...and what a difference! Love this cage, fits my 3 cockatiels perfectly with plenty of room to spare. Took about an hour to assemble, but everything went together without an issue. Only thing I can say I don't necessarily like is that the doors on the side are only on a spring (pull towards you from the outside) with no locking mechanism option. Had to get separate clips to prevent any accidents as they are not all that difficult to open. Other than that, i'm very happy with this cage!! large cage, medium quality metal though. It's a bit difficult to clean and the hanging food cups it comes with can melt in the dishwasher, but for the price it was well worth it. The few cons I have are that the wires can be a little flimsy, and in order to put the cage together you need to bend a few of them. Larger doors would also be very helpful as its a little difficult to get large sticks and perchs in and out. The side doors are also held shut by only a small spring, no latch. A smart bird, or whatever else in the cage, would only have to figure out that he can push the door open and escape. Great home for parakeets. We have two of them. Perfect size for maybe four or five parakeets. Enough room to fly and be happy. Food dishes are great, fill them up and don't have to worry about refilling for almost two weeks. I do check every other day though as the water dishes evaporate. Super easy to clean. Super easy to set up, didn't even need the directions. Quality is also good. I would say the locks need a spring to assure the birds can't lift them up. Came home one day and the birds weren't in the cage. Smart buggers. My parakeets absolutely love this cage. The fact that they can exercise their wings by flying around in the cage makes me so happy. They are much happier birds too We purchased this, and after a few months, the place where the screws go into the panels popped out completely, leaving the cage useless. I made several attempts to contact Prevue's customer service through their phone number, never having my call answered, so I e-mailed them, and was told they would provide a replacement part, but I would have to pay for shipping, and they couldn't tell me what that would be until it actually shipped. Sturdy enough for my plumhead parakeet & a couple more med size birds would still have flight space. It\u2019s bendable a tad bit also,so it\u2019s exactly what I expected. Easy to clean. Love the 4food trays it comes with too. ", "I bought this for my parakeet. She seems very happy with it, lots of room, no problem climbing around on the vertical bars after being used to having horizontal bars in her old cage. The height is, like others have mentioned, possibly more than you need. Birds with clipped wings who take a tumble when they try to fly will fall quite fall in this cage, keep that in mind. Lots of doors make it convenient to place dishes, toys, etc into cage.You will need additional perches - this comes with three dowels but they are quite large and birds benefit from having a variety of perch sizes to choose between. I had bought this cage model second hand for my budgies and loved it; so finding a new one at this price was an awesome deal since the person who sold it to me paid 250 for the first cage, new. Unfortunate for me, the cafe came in looking like it had been banged around previous to having been boxed. Several bits were bent making it necessary to be bent back into shape durring assembly. We have two small parrolettes and they are in heaven. Although the cage is pretty large, I feel like they advanced from a small apartment to a mansion as my son called it. This cage is pretty great for my cockatiel, very sturdy, nice, and she has lots of room to fly and explore. Assembly wasn't hard, but some of the wires were bent out of shape, especially around the links of the sides of the cage and the small side doors. The plastic trays for food and water are very cheaply made and don't fit in the cage barely at all... not what I expected. Still, good cage for the price and I think it will last us a long time. I\u2019m sure my 5 little zebra finches feel like they died and went to heaven in this HUGE enclosure. I love it! All of the doors make it easy to arrange and clean. The assembly was so much easier than I expected after reading all of the reviews. I did most of it myself but had a little help with the last few steps. It took about 30-45 minutes. The directions were just fine. Great cage for sugar gliders A few of my pieces did not fit as nicely as I liked and some of them had rust :(.... although, I just have cockatiels and they aren't that strong...A little disappointing but, the overall structure is sturdy.. Its enough space for more than 3 of them. Well to be perfectly honest, the instructions suck! It took me HOURS to put it together because I had to guess, than has to disassemble part and redo it due to the poor instructions. Also the spring doors have very sharp edges and I'm terrified my birds will injure themselves on it, I will be attempting to take them off if I can. Perfect for our Cockatiel. He has a lot more room to play and spread his wings! There is plenty of room for multiple birds of you have them. Easy to assemble. Recommend wire ties, pipe cleaners or similar to hold edges together during assembly stages if doing the assembly alone. Bought for a flying squirrel and he can grasp the wire easily as well as run along the perch dowels. Plenty of room for added branches hollow logs and nesting bags. ", "I have 2 cockatiels and 1 parakeet that I always let free fly in my sunroom which left it quite a mess with chewing, and their feathers and whatnot all over. I had a quite nice parrot cage with a play top which they did not have enough room to live in. For those who have problems with assembling the cage, here are the steps. Refer to the first page of the instruction manual to see what pieces I am referring to in my instructions. Easy to assemble, though the instructions could use better illustrations. I was in a rush and assembled a few parts backwards and had to redo it. It only took about 20 minutes. Wanted a large cage for our parakeets I absolutely loved this case for my two parakeets. Ever since I have had this cage, (which has been a few months now) I can say the birds are so much happier. They have more than enough room to fly in there. They love it. The price was not bad at all for the size of the cage. It is huge! They used to be in the standard size cage I had bought them at Petco, so this change is amazing to them. The cage is so big that my husband wanted to buy two more parakeets. Overall we are very satisfied with the product and all the extra playing and chirping that came as a result from it. I would most definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase it. The only thing is to make sure you have help building it. I almost wanted to send it back for that reason, but it was worth the time and effort in the end. Very nice size cage for my Greencheek he loves it, easy to set up. I only had one issue, which I easily fixed where a single small bar popped off the side of the cage. This is a great size cage! For the price you can't go wrong. It was very easy to put together with two people about 40 minutes. It is a little on the flimsy side so no good for larger birds. I have a green cheek conure and this cage could easily house more. Inside cage size is 30 1/4\" x 20 1/4 \"x 40\" . The cage was packed nicely and secure. Some say the instructions or horrible but mine were very clear and we had no problem at all putting it together. Highly recommend this cage! Works great!  Sturdy and easy to assemble but hard enough to assemble that when my son put the back on the front he decided to leave it so he wouldn\u2019t have to take it all apart. Would have been super easy to put together fast IF any of the pieces would have had their labels! So it took us a little longer to put together but we love it! So do our 10 zebra finches.  If the pieces were labeled I would have given 5 stars. Great cage. A little challenging to get together but once I did it\u2019s sturdy and good quality. Very spacious the birds love it! ", "Great flight cage for the price.  Installation is fairly simple and all of the pieces and bolts fit perfectly.  I don't like the rollers on the bottom, so I replaced them with stationary chrome/plastic feet.  I placed the cage on top of an appropriately sized coffee table.  This elevates the cage so the finches feel more comfortable flying to the bottom.  Also, I chose the color black because my existing white cage seems to reflect too much light and it's harder to see the birds. I was so excited to get this cage!! My 9 year old daughter and I put this cage together on our own so it\u2019s simple to do! It was packaged well and came promptly. I would say it took about an hour to put together. My budgies LOVE this cage. Only problem is now I have to order bigger toys. \ud83d\ude02 I highly recommend this product. I LOVE this cage & so do my finches!  I put it together myself, although it did say 2 people should put it together.  The instructions were clear as well as the pictures. The smaller doors on both sides of the cage make for easy access to almost all parts of the cages and being as they are small and spring loaded I just put my arm in and don't worry so much about someone escaping.  That all being said this cage would be perfect for most any bird but I imagine a really large bird could bend the bars.  I only have 2 issues:  The first being the tray on the bottom was a little loose fitting and kept trying to fall out I got it in but if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate.  The second is the thickness of the perches.  These perches are for a MUCH larger bird I did use a couple but I also have my own smaller ones that attach to the cage I plan on addressing this with the manufacturer. I loved this cage... I have 4 budgies and wanted to put them all in one large cage bc the once they were in were too small and they dint have that much flight room. The cage is great. Dowels warped but usable, and just one of the trays arrived with a tab broken off so it can't be used. It's a real pain to assemble by yourself.  Also, the spring-loaded doors open outward, so a smart bird could learn to simply push on a door and escape. Purchased this for my four cockatiels.  Perfect cage.. once you get it together. The directions require a magnifying glass and even then, you're left wondering which piece goes where as none are marked and some are very similar.  Once I got it together, which required two people, I realized I had a couple in the wrong place.. but after the hours it took to get it together there was no way I was taking it apart.  BUT even with the mistakes, it works and it sturdy and the birds don't seem to mind that the bottom should actuallly be on top..lol This was a birthday gift for my son he was extremely dissappointed when this arrived with a cracked tray and bent and broken cage sides. The company had to send me replacement panels but were wonderful about being prompt and forgiving of the damaged parts. I own a cage like this and like it but this one was defective. I was not happy. ", "My flying squirrel absolutely loves this cage. There\u2019s some really weird doors on it that have to be (in my opinion) Zip tied shut because they\u2019re easily pushed open but other than that it\u2019s a great cage My parakeets LOVE this new cage. It took my husband about 2 hours to put it together. My birds are so much happier in this cage and it has all sorts of door and latches that make it very easy to access the birds and water, food etc. Would recommend to everyone. The cage came with all the prices and all the screws and my cockatiels love it and I do too however, the doors however are quite small and difficult to reach in the cage everywhere and the cage isn\u2019t very sturdy. Also the directions to assemble it weren\u2019t very clear and it was difficult. I did already write a review for this - because I am so pleased with this birdcage.  My birds are so happy!!!! I bought this cage at a local store for $200 (should have checked Amazon...) and it's awesome. I have a single (spoiled) cockatiel in it and she has sooo much room to move around. It's wonderful. There are small doors on the sides with no locking mechanism, but I just ziptied them closed. Problem solved. Tray on the bottom is easy to remove and clean. Perches are a nice size. Four food bowls are included. I do wish they made a better cage cover for this (the one they do make is too thin to be of any use), but I will just make my own. Great cage but was going to buy 2 more but prices went way higher. So going to wait till process go back down again. Got this for my budgie, he loves all the space he gets! Would recommend for up to 3 small birds or 1-2 medium birds. Very sturdy, came in perfect condition, and easy to clean. (Unfortunately my budgie doesn\u2019t like it when the floor moves! Poor baby) Great in so many ways, but their is a flaw.  Where the legs meet the bottom of the cage, all four corners of my cage pulled away.  This led to the grate and tray beneath to fall down.  This means any animal in cage could escape.  Fortunately none of my birds got out as this happened while I was moving the cage.  I have used wire to hold it together for now, may need to get some zip ties. I love this cage. Was easy to put together even though the instructions used very few words, the illustrations showed exactly how it was supposed to go together and while I did have to fight with a few pieces and as for help from my girlfriend, from start to finish was about 20 minutes. My 2 birds LOVE the space! It did have 1 loose bar at the top, but nothing a little silver solder didn't fix. Great large cage for my 5 parakeets. Putting it together by yourself is hard because you have to line everything up without the other side falling out, so have someone help. I like the bottom grate can come out for cleaning along with the tray. ", "I don't know what to say. Such a short distance from being satisfied with the product and total mess. They didn't even look at what are they packing. Great large cage. Was packaged very well, no bent bars or anything. Also, the instructions were pretty straight forward, took me about 30 minutes to put the whole thing together, without any help! I had limited space for this cage, otherwise I would have gotten the xl. Worth the 117 I paid for it. We've been really happy with this cage.  4 parakeets live happily with plenty of space.  The poo tray is a little annoying as it sometimes slips tracks - but there are bars above the tray, so no escape concern while you clean. The doors (many ) shut well, seems sturdy.  It comes with feeders that are just fine, but we ended up getting new ones because they are a little tight, and I kept spilling the water changing it.  Also, they're uncovered, so they get seed all over and poo in their water.  Pretty minor issue though. This cage is amazing! I only wish I would have bought it sooner. My finches recently had babies and everyone needed a bigger home. This cage provides them so much more room to fly and hop about. It also has four food and water compartments. It was fairly simple to put together and is very sturdy. A great buy for the price. You will not be sorry you bought this! Your birdies won\u2019t either. Bummed bars were bent and the tray came broken, still in the box a year after purchasing and now I'm on here searching for a tray that will fit... One of the grille prices was welded backwards and was not able to assembled the cage correctly. Also, a hex screw, which is used in assemble and are not given any extras, was stripped. I will say the package was emaculant. The directions are simple. My complaint is of the manufacturing issue. Wonderful, my birds, 5 cockatiels, are so happy.  Lots of room for them, perches, toys, food, everything.  You HAVE to have help holding it during assembly, but not hard to do.  The wheels allow for easy moving, I roll it out on my patio during sunny days and bath time.  The tray removes and cleans easily in the tub.  Hang the feed trays low and the most of the seeds stay in the cage.  Best purchase ever for my birds! Don't be fooled by the Amazon's Choice label. That is based on reviews which are mostly fake per Fakespot. The bars and flimsy and the quality control is abysmal. The cage I received cannot be constructed as the holes are pre-drilled on the WRONG SIDE of one of the panels. This is in addition to the damaged panel I received. Going through the reviews, this an common issues. STEER CLEAR of this poor product! I bought it for my parakeets, arrived very secure in the box, and no damages at all. Love this cage, it was easy to assemble just took me 30 minutes to do it, I might buy different wheels cuz these ones do not have brakes but it's not a big deal. Day 1 with this new cage and so far so good! Got this for my two male cockatiels who both love to explore and play, and therefore need a lot of space. They normally hate being confined but have appeared to take well to this larger enclosure. It was fairly easy to put together as well, I did it by myself in about an hour. Great cage for the price! ", "I now have 11 parakeets after one of my females had 6 babies.  They are all very much enjoying themselves and have plenty of room to hop, climb and fly.  I am so happy I got this cage, it's not as flimsy as some cages.  Very sturdy and great quality.  I highly recommend this product. Just finished putting this item together last night. It is a great cage for the price. Nice and big and plenty of accessories. The assembly was easy enough, save for a few human errors (no ones perfect!) but we are looking forward to housing our brand new Cockatiels in this cage. They'll have plenty of space to stretch their wings for sure. I don\u2019t know what these people are talking about their cage all bent... the packaging is amazing there\u2019s no way for bent pieces... easy to put together.... awesome cage!!!! I\u2019m happy I bought it!!!! Almost didn\u2019t too reading reviews.... honestly you ain\u2019t loosing with this cage and for price you can\u2019t go wrong!!!! Promise it\u2019s legit!!!! We have two quaker parrots  We just got them an wanted new cages. I read a lot about cages and the reviews on these was pretty good. These had some instructions but my husband put on together today with a little help from me. They are good sturdy cages an bigger than they sound. If you have to put it together by your self you could use some light wire to hold it untill you tighten the screw. As the one person said there were two holes on top corner he had to drill out. No big deal Thet have four double seedor food holders and four perches'see no reason to not give them five stars The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 Stars is the fact that the cage did not come with labeled parts.  Yes there are instructions but be prepared to do some guessing.  Assemble with two people, doing this solo is a pain.  Other than that this cage is amazing for the price!  My Cockatiel does great in this! Great cage for the price. Assembly was easy. We keep our Quaker parrot in it. He has lots of room for his toys. Great cage, especially for the price. One bar snapped out of it in the first week we've had it -- ended up just putting one of the bowls over the hole. Can't argue with a cage this nice for that price. Some assembly required. It took me over an hour to unpack the cage and another two hours to put it together. It\u2019s well worth the cost. It is strong and well made. But, Some assembly required. Absolutely love this cage! It did take me several hours to put it together but my only assistants were a chair, the wall, the floor, and some zip ties! Considering I\u2019m close to 70 I thought I did really well. Quality is great and my five parakeets love it. I put this together myself with no help or tools.  It took me several hours because I went slow.  My two parakeets LOVE this.  It\u2019s their home and not a cage.  Looks nice.  Rollers make it easy to move.  Easy to clean. ", "I was pretty excited to put together this cage for my extremely pampered Love Birds. It's a beautiful cage, the casters glide wonderfully (Even over the seeds they throw on the ground), and the spacing is perfect so they can't escape (no zip ties necessary for this cage!) I have two cockatiels - one with disabled feet. I wanted a large area for him to walk so ended up with a much taller cage to get that overall room. I have added multiple ladders and perches to this cage to help him navigate. The doors are great - there are 6 - 2 each on the front and sides - making it easy to adjust toys and perches. Our birds really love their new digs. It is easy to move them from room to room and there is a nice large shelf underneath to store their gear. I got this cage for my Sun Conure to use during the day on a screened in porch like an aviary. It was easy to put together, secure, large, and allows for plenty of active movement and toys. It was an excellent price for this size cage. It is simply designed and very functional. Absolutely worth it! I LOVE this cage.  Its plenty big for my cockatiel.  What I was looking for in a cage is one that my baby can fly around in and at least spread her wings a bit, and this allows that.  It not big enough that she can /really/ fly wildly around in it, but that would take an actual avery i think, lol. I got this cage for my sugar gliders. It is a great size, and it was pretty easy to put together, but you will probably need 2 people to hold things together while you assemble it. The only complaint I have is that you have to find a way to secure the 6 side doors because they do not have a latch. Overall, I think this is a great cage for the price. This cage sells for $250 at my local pet store. Super easy to assemble. Took me 15 minutes alone. Large and sturdy. Tray and bottom cage shelf slide out easily for cleaning. I use the saran that sticks in the tray for super easy clean up. Plenty of space to house conures or smaller birds. We have 2 conures in ours and they love to climb all over it. Do have to add clips to the side doors as they are spring loaded only. My keets love this cage!  I have 2 of this cage now.  Lots of places for toys, dishes and them to just enjoy themselves.  Only thing I don't like are the open dishes because they started laying eggs in them. Just changed them over to smaller covered dishes.  If they wouldn't lay eggs in them, the dishes would have been perfect. Used as home for 4 young yappy parakeets. Nice cage for the $$. Don't be fooled difficult to assemble. Directions are vague. Parts not numbered to go with directions. Be prepared to buy different perches. These are to large for Lovebirds, Cockatiels. To assemble I put base together first as per instruction, then put base on it's back and assembled the back while laying on the floor, I also added the screws to help hold but didn't screw tight. I purchased this for my two Zebra Finches named Scratch and Sniff ", "I bought this for my 2 sugar gliders and it is perfect. I assembled it very easily with the help of my 10 year old son in less than an hour. It is easy to clean, easy to roll and the bar spacing is true to size (my babies are unable to escape!). This is a fantastic cage and a great price So I basically have a flock of budgies and I had to buy a second one of these and connect it to the first one I owned. They love the space even though I let them out. I spare no cost for my feathered babies and for the quality I am 100% you would not be able to get a similar item for under $200 This bird cage is perfect for my 3 conures. A little flimsy, but to be expected with the low cost of product. I wanted something that would fit through the door, but also be big enough to give my birds their space, this cage was on target. In photo it does look a bit like a double cage but, it\u2019s not. I purchased the cage for sugar gliders. The directions were simple, I had to match parts based on pictures which was not a big deal. I assembled alone with no help in about an hour. The cage is not black. It's a dark pewter but still blends in fine. Great for the price! This cage has very bad welds had to use tie straps. The doors are very badly made. It's  low quality, but it's a good size cage. I bought this cage on June 24 2016. Update... Today is September 20 2019 this cage has rusted right through in so many areas especially in the legs it's so bad that I need to buy another cage to replace this one before the birds get out. My wife and I have sugar gliders and were in desperate need of a bigger cage.  We looked at several different bird cages and even a big cage for ferrets.  We could not find a decently priced cage anywhere that would have small enough gaps in the sides to keep the gliders from escaping as well as enough room for them to move around.  My wife did some research and found this cage.  I took 2 looks at it and said that this was the one. It was exactly what we needed. It is made out of a durable material and now we aren't so much worried about them chewing the paint off the cage like they did with previous bird cages.  They absolutely love it and play a lot more.  We can tell that they are happier.  I have to say that even though this cage is larger, it is very easy to clean.  We just wheel it out side and spray it off with the hose. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone. It was very easy to put it together, it is super large and that is the long one.  I also love definitely safe and reasonable price, I am very satisfied. \u2764\u2764 Bars are really flimsy and come apart from seams very easily.. I\u2019m caging parakeets so they\u2019re not strong enough to chew bars..would never use it for a bird any larger than a parakeet Let me start out by saying I put this cage together by myself and it only took about 30 min if that. The bars are pretty flimsy and the side doors had to be zip tied shut because they push open way to easy but other than that its perfect. Great cage for my finches, they seem to love it. I upgraded from a cage half the size of this one. ", "Gorgeous huge cage for a wonderful price, but a few broken bars, looks like due to bad packaging. GOOD PRODUCT FOR A REALLY GOOD PRICE.  ORPHANED COCKATIEL WE FOUND SEEMED TO LIKE AND NOW HE IS STILL LIVING IT AT A NEW HOME. None Bought this for my two zebra finches. The instructions were pretty terrible but luckily I have a smart boyfriend who figured it out. It's pretty solid! It's honestly very nice! My only suggestion is that this company work on making better instructions.... Everything about this this is perfect. So easy to construct, perfect for parakeets because they fly horizontally, easy to build, and just wow. The doors are very secure. The pullout tray works great. The whole design is fantastic. Perfect for finches, parakeets and button quail. Easy to put together and once birds are removed it can be power washed! Great cage! Very happy! We have 3 parakeets and this cage gives them a lot of space to climb, fly, play with each other and their toys. This cage is spectacular I use it for a small parrotlet but it would work for a much larger bird he has all kinds of room. I did have to secure the doors on the sides as I was afraid of him getting out or other animals getting in SO, this is the 4th time ive gotton this cage, the first was for parakeets and the rest have been for cockatiels. Im still putting this last one together. so far its been a half hour and im not even close. the pieces are getting worse made every time. the last time the top was bent but other then that everything went in fine. THIS TIME. i cant even get the bottom back pannel to screw in on one side because they arent fitting right together. im supposed to get my new baby tiel soon and this cage has to be done.  it is a great cage once its done, and IS supposed to be done with 2 people but ive done it everytime except one by myself. THIS itme is just horrable. Normally id reviw this cage and say its awesome except the pieces can be bent. right now its such a dificulty because of this piece wont fit in right. My cage arrived yesterday and despite the directions saying you need two people, it only took me about 30 minutes to assemble alone. Some of the bars were bent, but a pair of pliers was all it took to easily repair them. Overall, my bird loves her new cage. ", "Cage arrived with no damaged parts. While the assembly instructions and some reviews suggest having two people do the assembly, I don't see where that is necessary or even useful. One person can easily assemble the cage. The instructions are clear enough and emphasize the one important point, the spring doors open out. I like the cage, now I have to wait and see what the birds think of it. I have 2 parakeets in it and they fly all over. Very easy to keep clean with slide trays Took 2 people to assemble. You could probably do it by your self if you're more focused than me. Great size for price. My parakeet loves it. I definitely like this flight cage! Great value for the price we paid! We upgraded from a cage half the size and our birds are really happy. This came really fast. We were a little worried it would be flimsy because of the price, but it's sturdy as heck. No bends...all the pieces were there. The color matches our ferret cage exactly which was a plus. It's like a pitted metal dark silver color. I didn't have issues with the tray falling out. The instructions were clear, but the pictures were a bit small for me of the pieces. I wish there had been a picture of it all set up to help a little, but in all, it didn't take much time at all. My boyfriend helped, but it could definitely be done with one person. The screws have the tool included. My only complaint is that 2 of the 4 white food trays had broken hooks, so they are unusable. It came with 4 large food/water trays with perches, and 3 long wood perches also. Our parakeet is in heaven. Considering getting her a mate now. We had let her free roam, but the daily cleanup and her becoming tempermental was becoming an issue, so we thought we'd try this. The small starter cages are wayyyyy too small for birds IMHO. Just not humane. This cage is huge. Don't worry at all about size for a small size bird. They will love it. Yes there's plenty of flight room, which is what I was worried about. I was a little nervous about putting this together based on some of the reviews. Thankfully, the 4+ stars were right. We (and ours birds) love this enclosure! I liked the way the cage looked. It was nice and big. I would've rated it higher but it came with a defect. On one of the legs, the hole to screw in the bottom screen was I the wrong side, so I was only able to screw in 3 out of the 4 legs. I'm not going to bother going through customer service so I don't know how helpful they'd be in a similar situation. I assume they'd be helpful because I think Prevue is a good company, but I need the cage today and my husband is handy so he's just going to fix it. The cage was easy to assemble. It took me only 20 minutes to put it together. For the size this was definitely a good purchase. The wires are a little flimsy and a few bars on the top were bent out of shape, but they are close enough together that my parakeets cannot escape. Received cage with defective miss tapped hex screws and the bottom shelf (part C1) which had a corner that was not welded.I received a pack of replacement screws and no shelf.The person I have dealt with is  Jenifer K. who required me to email her my entire invoice of the order which I find as unusual just to get defective parts replaced.  I have contacted customer service 3 times in nearly a month. This cage is really heavy and with the bottom shelf not welded correctly (one corner not welded at all) the whole cage is unstable, This is not good.. The size of the cage is nice, and it is fairly easy to put together, but the slide at the bottom that holds the tray and grille was welded on upside down! As a result of this, the tray fits in the top part and the grille under it (which is utterly useless). Also, out of the four plastic feeding trays, two were broken. I've been looking around for a number to call to ask for replacement parts, but so far, no luck. ", "I was able to assemble this cage mostly alone. It seems to be very sturdy and the size Large I ordered gives my parrotlets lots of extra room. i had been looking at this cage for awhile at my local pet store but finally ordered from amazon- it was nearly 1/2 the price for the EXACT same cage! :)  assembly was easy but would be easier with two people- i just used twist ties to hold it together while i tightened the screws.  My parakeets LOVE it and with the casters it can easily roll onto my deck.  Great product and highly recommend!! The quality of the product is pretty lacking. Multiple piece were bent and needed a decent amount of persuasion to make fit. The whole cage does not look bad. This cage is great. Easy to put together, gives my parakeets plenty of flight room, and moves easily when I need to move it. I love the number of access panels/doors on it. There are two large ones on the front and then there are 4 on each side. Makes getting to things so much easier and I love that my  birds still have plenty of room to move around and stretch their wings even with their toys. I had a little trouble with assembly because it didn't have instructions in the box but this is a BIG cage, its sturdy and an EXCELLENT value. Don't hesitate if you need a roomy cage. I have 7 society finches, a Lady Gouldian, and a button quail in it and they are all happy. I just love this cage, my finches love it. They have plenty of flight space now. It was fairly easy to assemble, doing so myself. Great purchase for our favorite 4oz sugar glider Dobby! Dobby really LOVES his giant new cage he gets to rattle around in at 4AM while squeaking in utter delight. I do wish however it had come with shelves but since it's a parrot cage I assumed it wouldn't. The instructions were a pain, because nothing is numbered. Had to adjust the doors differently so my glider doesn't get out. Seems a little flimsy, but in another way solid. My sugar glider seems to love it a lot better than her other cage, as she has a ton of room to glide now. Overall I'm happy with it. Specially for the price! sturdy construction, lots of room for the parakeets to fly around in, came with wheels! Five Stars for sure.  Excellent material, Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Has wheels so that you can simply move cage around.  Tray for droppings slides out easily to clean.  Our Budgie loves this cage!  She can fly around from branch to branch, swing and get to food dishes with ease. Our budgie tweeted and chirped with delight in her new cage as soon as she got in there! If you have large birds ( 6 inches or larger ) it is roomy for maybe a couple or three max.  Thanks Prevue! ", "I have a small parakeet and the bars are fine for her, they aren't wide enough for her to slip through. The wood perches seem kind of wide for her feet but she doesn't really seem to mind. I think she likes all of the room she has in there compared to her old cage I do love the cage as it has TWO perches and many doors on the front and sides. It works great as an small indoor aviary for my finches and canary. However, the seed cups even when sanded down do not fit properly. I use a Tidy Seed or the Corral Seed cup and screw on cups for the water as well as water bottles. Otherwise, it looks great in my living room in front of the window. I like that it is not too tall and low to the ground for a great appearance. I plan to purchase more of these. Excellent cage for the money. They must have seen reviews about assembly issues because mine came with instructions. The cage is a great size for my finches.  After a few months, the plastic tray that sits on the bottom of the cage and collects the waste, doesn\u2019t stay on the cage - it falls off. Flimsy plastic tray. A lot of people don't realize that finches need a lot of space to fly! It keeps them happy and healthy. And for a finch to achieve full flight they need at least 20 inches of space but preferably more. And, flying up requires more energy than just flying side to side. With those things in mind, I realized I would be shortening the life of my new finches by keeping them in a pretty little cage! So, I shopped around and found this beauty. It has wheels, but I chose not to put them on. Instead, I put it on a small table because finches like to fly up for security. I didn't use the massive wooden perches that came with it, because they take up too much space. Instead I bought a few different styled, finch-sized perches and put them in. It says it can fit 6 finches, but I am an animal lover and I veer more toward giving my 2 birds space to do what they are made for: flying!! I have 4 parakeets in this cage and they LOVE it. They're very active and get plenty of exercise flying from perch to perch. The price was reasonable, it arrived in good condition, and it was not hard to put together. Instructions aren\u2019t very clear on which panel goes where for assembly but it\u2019s easy to figure out. Took about 30 mins to assemble it. So far me and my two cockatiels love it. Plenty of space for them. I would recommend this cage for cockatiels, lovebirds, and parakeets only. Anything bigger would be able to bend the bars easily. I bought this cage for my new Indian Ringneck baby before she came home. It was packaged nicely with extra padding on the sides, and the contents were in great shape. The only modification I had to do was push down one of the door loops with vice grips because the door wouldn't close. There were no bent wires, nothing missing, etc. It says that it requires two people to put together, but I put it together by myself. It wasn't difficult to put together, just very particular in the order you must put the parts together in. You have to install the dowel perches (I only used two and wrapped them in vet wrap because babies are clumsy) BEFORE you put the front panels on. This is a very nice cage. I like the fact that it is on rollers and can be easily moved for sweeping. I moved my Parakeet from his little cage that he HATED into this and he loved it right from the beginning!  He was an only budgie, but this cage was so nice and roomy that I got him a friend.  They really like it.. At one point I had three parakeets in there, but one of them died so now there are only two.  But there is plenty of room if you have multiple birds.  This is a LARGE cage, so make sure you have plenty of room for it! ", "My birds love this.  Definitely need two people to put together.  Make sure your slide out tray is on the right way before adding sides.  I put mine on backwards and didn't  realize until the cage was completely finished.  I left if that way!  Two of my plastic perch feeders were broken where they connect to the cage.  I just used the other two.  Instructions were short and simple just make sure all of your doors open to the out side before assembly. I like the cage but it was hard to put together, no parts were labeled. I also have a few missing parts which I have to report. This is plenty big for all my finches After reading other reviews I thought that it would be hard to assemble but my son put together for me in under an hour. I love it my birds think they are in heaven. Although it is not Black more of a grey but looks good anyway. My only complaint would be the instructions that came with it the print was very small and hard to read, that is why I gave it only four stars. It came late because UPS had lost it but well worth the wait. This cage is awesome! I love the spring doors....and more importantly, my 2 Parakeets are having a blast!! A solid and very attractive cage! Great value for the money, more than enough room for 3 cockatiels, side doors need to be secured though The cage is easy to clean and provides my budgie a lot of flight space, but when assembling it, a hole I needed to align part of the cage wall into was entirely missing. It took some drilling to make our own hole before continuing assembly. Over all it is a nice cage for the money. The directions are not that easy to understand but I was able to figure it out This has worked out great for my parakeets.  It fairly large but fits nicely in a corner of my kitchen.  You can easily wheel this around for easy vacuuming/cleaning.  My two little guys love being able to spread their wings and fly throughout the cage.  Made only for non-destructive birds for the bars are very thin.  Assembly was easy. I have a sun conure and it has a lot of room to fly and play shes always happy because i was able to put lots of toys and bowls of food and water, just a fun house to move things around for my feather beautiful happy birdy companion. A very good bargain! ", "Just got my budgies in it tonight. Looks great.  Definitely can\u2019t assemble alone so have a helper. Big cage for five parakeets (I have 14 parakeets).  The five birds are new babies and they love flying around inside.  The cage arrived with two broken food bowls and a cracked bottom tray but the manufacturer promptly replaced them at no charge. AMAZING especially for price. Contrary you what other people wrote I had a fun time assembling it.  I'm so happy that my cockateil has that much room now and I'm bird sitting a friends parakeet who actually flies a little in this cage!  Would definitely recommend. I needed a cage due to an accident that resulted in four babies. I went in with trepidation after reading quite a few of the other reviews. This cage is a really good size for my two finches.  The wire gauge and spacing is perfect for these small birds.  I love the 6 little spring doors, there is no way my little birds could open them.  The cage is sturdy enough that my cat can't break in or tip it over. Being able to pull out the mess drawer AND the wire cage floor is really important to be able to clean it without a lot of fuss.  The price for this cage is really great too, other ones similar to this are at least 1 and 1/2 times or twice the cost. Definitely need two people to assemble and the assembly is kind of a pain in the butt. Once it is made it\u2019s fantastic though. Finally was able to give my lovebird more room. This cage is great. Ive been wanting to upgrade and so glad I did. Now I have 4 parakeets. It looks so good in my living room and is so easy to clean.Tray and grate pull out seperatly and easily. There are a few side doors that I put little clips on becuase they have no locking device. The many little doors makes very easy access for food water and toys. Quality product at a great price. If i could give zero stars i would.  I bought this cage for our new bird. We assembled the cage and put all our toys in only to find that theres a broken bar that wasnt soldered well and is poking out of cage.  This cage is less than poorly made and didnt even last long enough to put the bird in it.  This is a dangerous cage for birds. None Very large cage for smaller type birds.. a African grey will get out though ", "Wasn't hard to put together at all, very solid and didn't encounter any of the problems I read in other reviews. Great cage for not much money. Loved the cage and so do my 3 cockatiels . Was fairly easy to put together so that was great. Put it together in less then one hour with the help of someone else . Loved the little feeding trays included . Love all the doors that this cage has . I have 2 budgies that I got almost 3 years ago and they've been cramped on the cage they came with ever since. It was super small especially now that they're both grown up and I felt so bad. I got attracted to this product because it's a fairly huge and it's cheap for it's size compare to other cages I've seen. So I ordered it on Jan 18 and it came Jan 21st which was great because the estimated ship date was Feb 15. Needless to say that this cage is AMAZING! its wrought iron so its more heavy duty than my previous one. It was easy to assemble and hardly got any problems at all. There's alot of doors so you you can reach in easier for cleaning and such. The wheels are great so I can take them to the living room in the day and roll them to my room at night. I really do love this cage and I recommend this to anyone that's looking for a replacement. One thing though is that some of the holes that's been punched have the little pieces still attached to it so the screw wouldn't go in. But nothing that a nail and hammer can't do :) But before you order this, make sure you have the room for it. Thanks for this ever making amazing cage!!! Sturdy cage.  Great for my two parakeets.  My cat has laid on top under the cage cover and the cage doesn't seem bothered the birds a different story. I love this cage very much, I got it for my pet rats. The only problem I\u2019ve had with it is that lining up some of the pieces when assembly was extremely hard, took multiple tries and multiple people to put together. Other than that I\u2019ve loved this cage. Works but the item came with parts that should have been welded and were not. Assembly was not very fun but you are getting an inexpensive bird cage. Great quality and easy assembly. Ours houses 5 parakeets. Great price compared to local big box stores. Not bad to put together. Latches not good. Tray can drop out when you don\u2019t want it to. Seed goes everywhere.  Wanted more room for cockatiels.  Wouldn\u2019t buy again. I have had this cage for almost 4 years now. It is still in good condition and my birds love it. I would never recommend anyone to buy pet store cages , because of their small size and expensive tag. PLEASE buy this for your birds, don't restrain them to a small cage, where they can't spread their wings and explore. Overall good cage for the price. 2 pieces we're bended, but I still was able to put it together.building it was pretty easy.overall very happy with it. ", "putting it together was really at ask, you do need 2 people to put together. It took me 2 hours plus and if I had another There's nothing even remotely wrought iron about this cage, but for the price I expected that to be a marketing lie. That said, it is a nice, large cage, and assembly was easy. Unfortunately the design leaves a bit to be desired. The spacing on the bars doesn't match up with the spacing on the feed cups, making them awkward to fill and clean. For the price I'm happy with the cage. I love this cage, but I probably wouldn't have purchased it if I had read the reviews first. Yes, it did take two people to assemble -- but that is often the case when putting items together. Yes, the welding didn't hold on one of the tines, but it doesn't affect the cage integrity. My only real complaint is that the tray in the bottom of the cage is difficult to slide into place and doesn't stay in place. I've solved this by storing extra care items in a plastic container that sits on the bottom shelf and is just the right height to hold the tray in place. Not the perfect solution, but it works. Most importantly, my parakeets love the space they now have. So all-in-all, I'm very happy with this product. Love the cage Mike to Quaker parrots absolutely love the size gave it to four only because the instructions are too big to understand and you have to figure it out on your own other than that I would buy it again We have 4 parakeets and we love this cage. It gives them so much room and they love it!! Very easy to set up and every easy to clean!! Very happy with this purchase!! i love the flight cage because it  is so huge for one.  i don't have to worry about my parakeets being all crowded in a small cage,; they have plenty of room to fly around.  its's also convenient with all the different spots on which you can enter the cage from any direction in the upper/lower area.  i would recommend it to one and all.  i had to have assistance from my daughter when it came to putting the sides up.  the instruction tells you ahead of time that it may take two people.  got it together within an hour.  love it. This cage is 0retty big. Bought it for my cockatiel. Actually planning on having 3 cockatiel in it. It's very spacious and roomy. The panels were slightly bent so more difficulty to put together. No instructions, but was able to figure it out and assemble within 2-3 hours.  Cage was good size and rolled pretty well.  Sizes have spring-loaded access doors, so I had to wire them shut to keep my bird from escaping. I am female, 63 yrs young.  It took a while to put together by myself.  I might suggest another pair of hands for assembling.  Nice cage.  Larger than I expected but nice features. My Lovebirds won't know what to do with all the room. ", "Arrived quickly in perfect condition and was really easy to put together. Dropped a star because one of the plastic feeding cups broke immediately...but I wasn't planning to use them anyhow. Overall it's a great cage and my two quakers seem quite happy. This XL cage is definitely super big! I\u2019ll add a new nesting box inside and hopefully my pair of cockatiels will make some babies again :) This cage is exactly what I wanted for my scarlet chested grasskeets and bourke parakeet! It gives them plenty of room to play and be active... especially on the random days that I can't let them out to fly around. I also love that it's very affordable and the quality is awesome!! I would not recommend this cage for birds larger than a rosella, conure, or other similar sized birds because the cage bars are not thick enough to withstand the beak strength of a larger parrot. None This cage is made of good quality and is an excellent value for the money.  My birds have more than enough room to party.  The water and food trays could use a design change as the birds make a mess with the food.  I would like some type of catch tray at the bottom of the cage to catch airborne bird seed.  Otherwise, this is a great cage.  The instructions are almost useless, but it was easy to assemble by viewing the photo.  The measurements are exact.  This is a big cage, so make sure you have the room for it. I ordered this cage a few months back and loved it. I hit reorder to get a second for a bird I just rescued.  What arrived was not the same cage but a similar one. The screws were stripped, 2 sides were bent, and one of the bird perches had a split in it.  You would think a quality control person would have caught this prior to shipping. Very disappointed this was nicer in person than I imagined. It was easy to assemble and one person was able to do it. Overall very nice cage, the only thing I don't like is the food and water bowls don't fit in between all of the columns. You have to move them around to find out where they fit best. Nice cage. Biggest issue was a bolt was malformed so I had to find an alternative and one of the food containers was broken. My two finch love the space though. Makes me feel better that they now have the ability to stretch their wings. Bought this for my lovebirds, they seem to love it. Its very spacious and i espciallylove that it has wheels that allow me to take the cage out during the day and putting it back inside at night. Missing bolts needed to hold cage together. Every peice came bent so had to rebend by hand. Not worth the money i spent on it. ", "Spacious, well made and reasonable priced. Assembly manual is a bit confusing, but that's nothing, you'll assemble it just once! Great cage my cockatiels love it. Plenty of room for them as well. Love that it\u2019s on wheels so it\u2019s easily movable to clean under Love this cage! I have 2 for my 4 birds. It's a great size for pairs or small families of anything from a sun conure size down. There's plenty of space for extra perches, hanging toys, food dishes. I like the slide out bottom tray. Makes for easy cleaning - you don't have to open the cage to get to it. Great product at a reasonable price. Big enough for my 2 \ud83e\udd9c with space to fly around. Perfect for my daughters baby! Easy to put together. Beautiful cage. Came in a day sooner than expected. Been wanting to get a flight cage for my parakeets and finally got this one. So far it is working out well.Only have it setup for 2 weeks. Easy to assemble and very big.  I have no complaints at all.  The instructions say it should take two to assemble.  Maybe so but I did it with only me and it wasn't too difficult at all.  Regular masking tape suffices as my third hand when needed.  The instructions are exactly what one would expect.  Probably written in Mongolian first then translated to Chinese northern then Chinese southern then English.  If you use your imagination and a little common sense they are quite understandable. This is a great cage. The wires are flexible, you can bend them very easily with your fingers. Took about 45 minutes to set up by myself. Look, we have 11 parakeets. This cage is so big it's probably too much room for the beauties but they love it. It is such a nice cage. Very much worth it. Awsome well worth the money I have 5 parakeets in this cage I could probably get 10 more it's huge well worth the money. Very well built little hard to put together definitely need two people job but I had it up and birds in the cage with in an hour I love it. Bernie in the summer I can roll it on my deck such a nice deal. Love my new cage thanks for a great product. ", "This cage comes with barley any instruction, and is super hard. When I got the package a piece was bent. Amazon was amazing and sent me one next day but in all of the joints it had medal still in it so it was hard to put the prices together. My four parakeets LOVE this home! It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and easy to roll out of the way for vacuuming underneath. We added a wooden play set & bird bath on the top of the cage because they are some free-range budgies and enjoy the outside of the cage just as much as the inside! Very happy! This is the best buy we have purchased for our birds. It is such a joy to watch them flying and enjoying the new freedom that their smaller areas didn't offer. I recommend highly recommend this product not only for the value, but for the health and happiness of your birds. Cage is structurally sound for a sleeping cage for a small primate. Only complaint is how close the bottom tray is to bars, enabling him to pull up and eat newspaper. Knowing parrots, it'd be a problem for them as well. Otherwise great buy for the price! Please ignore that \"well\" -> this app is being a little wonky and not allowing to delete: well.. This cage is well worth the money, my little birds are flying around in it, and love it, they're happy, they chirp and play in there all the time, I also purchased they're toys from Amazon, great cage, for the price, we're very happy.. Thank you Amazon, My parakeet is markedly happier since getting this cage set up for her. It's really huge for a keet and she knows the space is all hers. It comes with three long perches, but I recommend buying toys like hanging bells to put inside the cage as well so that your bird can fully enjoy the space and it won't feel empty to them. I am so happy with the flight cage.  I had no problem putting it together by myself although a second pair of hands would lessened the time.  I have 2 parakeets and they are loving their new cage.  I truly believe that if people are going to own birds of any kind, then the bird should be as comfortable as possible.  This cage exceeded my expectations and the price is incredible.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase and your birds will be happy as well. Large cage is ehh. 2 wires on top were extremely bent. I straightened them the best i could but the metal is so stretched theirs still a bad bow. Same goes for the bottom pan that slides out. Can see both imperfections in pics. For the price i expected something a little better quality or at least better inspected thru quality control. It will do tho. Probably would recommend. My budgie escapes out the spring doors. Was easy to put together and is a good size. But I had to zip tie the side doors. Plenty of room for a starling sized bird. Enough doors on 3 sides to easily clean the cage and place items such as water/food dishes, birdbath, and floor coverings. The only think I'd change - and only because I take the cage outdoors onto our deck and bring it back in daily, is that I'd put \"balloon\" type wheels instead of solid plastic wheels. Balloon type wheels would navigate the cracks/spaces between the deck boards better. ", "This was as advertised, but there were some quality issues.  The machining was poor.  One hole was drilled horizontally that should have been drilled vertically.  Luckily, we had a power drill- otherwise we would have been in a difficult situation.  The food cups are also very cheaply made.  They do not fit in properly, the clips are flimsy plastic, and one of the cups arrived missing the clips to hold it to the cage entirely. Just received this beauty from Amazon and Prevue got it spot on! This wrought iron cage is powder coated a dark pewter shade which makes it an awesome addition to the house. The instructions seemed a bit slight until you look at the parts and they are mostly self explanatory. One little problem with the instructions we worded out was \"Don't put the casters on when they say.\" The cage rolls about in a very hard to control way, wait till finished and put them on last. Bought this for a baby mockingbird after he had outgrown his first cage.  Needed something large enough for him to exercise his wings in preparation for release.  This worked perfectly.  In it's second incarnation, with some interior modifications, it became a temporary home for rescued kittens.  My plan was to get some finches, but the two kittens, now cats, are still very attached to their old home, frequently sleeping on top.  So, probably no finches, yet. I have 3 of these cages . They hold my sugar gliders and they are very happy in them . Lots of room and very easy to keep clean . Metal grates of the cage were packaged in plastic which kept them from being all scratched up but one panel was warped and another panel had bent wires.  The 4 plastic food/water dishes were just thrown into the box loose and one was broken.  The cage seems to be a bit flimsy but instructions for putting it together were good.  For the price it is okay. Your birds will be disoriented when you place them in the cage because they can really stretch their wings and fly! This is a very large cage, and is a good price.  I assembled it by myself without trouble.  I house doves in this cage, so I don't use the bottom grill because they like to walk around on the bottom a lot.  I just put the pan into the upper slot, what should be for the grill.  This cage is for docile birds like finches or doves; it wouldn't do for parrots because the doors open too easily. Everything was easy to assemble & I didn't need help to do it. Really nice large cage. Well made and rolls easy. Parts were all wavy and not straight, not sure if it's from manufacturing or shipping.  This made it harder to put together.  Also, the pan was cracked but Amazon gave me a partial refund for that. ", "Nice cage, exactly as pictured. Sturdy enough! Easy to see in and enjoy our birds. Love this cage! I used this cage for the iguana for outside sun bathing work and looks great !the quality is good There were some bars that were bent :( The cage is pretty nice, but its really hard to get things situated in it.  Birds seem to like it and that's all that matters, but its easy to clean and has enough room for toys, their food and extra perches.  it does need more clasps for the doors as it has several doors that you cant latch and they don't have a spring to them in keeping the doors closed.  Other than that, its a nice cage I bought this cage for my green cheek conure.  It's a great size for him with lots of climbing room.  The only drawback is the cups won't stay put, not a flaw with the cage, the bird is just a jerk.  He has plenty of room and lots of toys.  It does take 2 people to put it together.  Thinking of getting another for my parakeet. I bought this cage for our 4 Budgies. This was just what we wanted. Plenty of room for the toys and they can easily fly around. The wheels make it nice and easy to move. Simple to put together and very well made. This is a very nice cage. I am very pleased. It did take my husband and I about 2 hours to put it together. My bird is used to a large enclosure so I can't speak for her but so far she seems to be adjusting. She is a large conure(Patagonian). A bird any bigger than this might not be comfortable in this cage This will be much easier to keep clean. Also all pieces were in perfect shape. Took about an hour to put together, if you don\u2019t like IKEA you\u2019re not gonna like this one either. Great Cage My Parakeets Enjoy It, Just Instructions Were Alittle Weird But if you have expierence building stuff and figuring out on your own you won\u2019t have a problem Super deal for the price. After reading some of the negative reviews,  I was marginally worried that we would receive a dud...BUT wrong-o. Perfect condition, easy to assemble if you have 2 people, and exactly as advertised.  Very happy with this cage. ", "Well made, easy instructions to put together, great price for a VERY large cage.  Not meant for larger parrots as the bars are smaller and probably not strong enough to contain them.  Very well suited for parakeets, canaries, finches, even cockatiels. The cage is absolutely huge. You could fit an amazon in there and it would still have room. I have a small fancy green cheek conure. The only problem is, is that on the sides the doors do not have clasps or anything to make sure they stay shut. If you're looking for a big cage at a good price this is great. I fixed this problem by putting some of my birds toys on the door and the cage and secured them. I also used bread ties. It's a great cage, takes awhile to put up but very easy and simple! Your bird will love you if you get this. Awesome price for a bird cage! My budgies have plenty of room! Definitely a cage for smaller birds! The only problem I had was that one of the feeders clips that hold it the cage broke off and I would want it replaced! But all in all its a good deal! The pet store cage was much smaller and more expensive! I got the XL cage and this cage is fantastic. My green cheek doesnt know what to do with all his space. His old cage looked so crowded with those toys. Now it looks like I need to get him more. Was time consuming to put together but well worth it! The cage is amazing quality very big and steerdy!! My bird loves it!! Easy to assemble. My cage came with all the screws and was just as described. It is sturdy and has a lot of room for my bird. My only complaint is that it has these doors where my bird can easily open and get out. I fixed it with just adding clips on the side. I gave the cage a four because out of the six swing doors on this cage only four opened and two were welded closed. Also for Me this whole cage is to low to the ground and I own a cat that always tried to climb the cage. And if you own a sugar glider they might be able to squeeze through the gaps between each level of the cage. It is a big cage great for Birds. It would have gotten a higher score had it come with better instructions. It was missing a couple of holes for some of the prongs to go into. One of the holes that the screws goes into is missing. Once I got it assembled it's a nice cage for price. My parakeet and dove love it. Very thin wires so I wouldn't put anything bigger than a small conure in it. But aside from assembling its satisfactory We are happy with the Prevue F050 cage that we already have so we bought a second cage. The second cage however looks like it was through a war. The box had numerous holes and one leg was damaged beyond repair, on fact there was parts protruding from the box. I can't say for sure that the protruding part was the damaged leg. However it all worked out for the best as Prevue will replace the damaged parts. This product came with unfinished parts leading me to zip tie the cage together! This is junk, contacted the manufacturer and have heard nothing for 3 days now. I would have immediately returned this if it wasn\u2019t urgently needed. Amazon was listed as seller and shipper but have no way to directly contact them! ", "This is a great cage for my sugar gliders - lots of room to glide around.  A couple of spaces around the edge and on top were a little larger than others.  Ok for my older gliders, but for the younger one I just simply zip tied some small dowels around top edges outside of cage.  No big deal to do at all.  Well worth the price.  Sturdy cage. This has turned out to be an awesome purchase because my parakeets feel very happy in this cage. They have plenty of space to move about and  to fly around plus they do not fight like they used to. Extremely happy with the fact that it was very simple to assemble the cage. I recommend this cage to folks that have more than 4 birds!!!!!  Your birds will last longer living in this cage, that's a fact. The hardest part was definitely assembly you might need two people to assemble it but it is a easy to clean cage it is Great for budgies and it is  very sturdy, I can see this cage lasting a very long time. My keets love the new  cage. It is so much larger than I thought it would be. The only reason I did not give  it 5 stars is because the shelf is way too low. It is almost touching the floor. They could raise it so you could actually use the shelf. It does not fit the container of food or my basket that holds bird supplies and my dog can actually look I to the cage which ha  me worried. I am afraid he may scare them to death. Great cage... except the springs on the doors, could injury your bird. Wow! This cage is huge!! Definitely need at least 2 people to assemble. Sturdy and roomy and OMG, I ordered it on Wednesday and it arrived Friday -- and I live in Hawaii!! I give it 4 out of 5 because one of the joints is faulty: the screw has nothing to grab onto. Other than that, I'm very pleased. Excellent cage for the price! Plenty of space. Easy to clean. Easy to move. My conure loves it! Cheap wheels bend when you try to roll. We like to put our parrot outside on nice days. I bought one of these cages in July and it was relatively easy to assemble and all the parts were intact. I recently needed an additional cage so I ordered another one. Big mistake!! The second cage had holes on the frame that were not drilled through the entire piece  where the screws needed to go, parts were bent and one of the feeder trays was broken into three pieces. Fortunately I had a drill and was able to finish drilling the holes and I have requested a replacement tray.  I don't know if it will be replaced or not. It takes two people to put together but it is easy. Easy to clean and move around. My birds love it. ", "Great cage. Can't say enough good things about it. Great value. Very sturdy and large. I have looked at many pet stores before finding this one and comparable cages were priced at $250 and above. Overall an amazing deal. Would definitely recommend! My cockatiels are very happy and comfortable. Really need two people to assemble. Other than that the cage works well. My parakeet is thrilled with the room as he can fly some without hitting his wings. Took out the rack in bottom and placed paper there. Bottom tray wipes clean easily! If I had room my two parrotlets would have one too. For the price, can't beat it! We just bought this cage to move our 5 quaker parrots into after they had been in two separate smaller cages for years. They love it. It is more than enough room for all five together, and they mostly just hang out in the top anyway. The bottom tray is so light and easy to take out to sift their litter. If you have multiple small birds such as parakeets or budgies, this is the perfect cage. Assembly was easy too, my husband and I finished it in maybe 20 minutes. Very nice cage.  Study and stable. My 2 cockatiels loved it! It\u2019s big and has so much room! The spring side doors caused a little concern but adding some clips fixed that problem! Definitely worth the money! Assembly was not that complicated did on my own in less than an hour! My birds had babies and needed a bigger cage. This is awesome! Only time and wear will tell if this product can last but so far, the size and ease in assembly is very good. The method of assembly is quite intuitive. I do have complaint about the packaging/box was damaged during shipment. I have read other purchasers revel the same issue. Only problem really after unpacking, was a rod that slide into sleeve was bent and wouldn't fit. I used pliers and screwdriver to force it back so the rod would fit. The plastic bowls were all intact. All loose pieces were smartly packaged in plastic bags and easy to find. The wheels were surprisingly better then expected, they are round, ball bearing wheels. Easy to put together and a great size for the finches that live in it. It doesn't need all the feeding dishes, but has plenty of room for a few live plants, which the birds seem to enjoy. I ordered this cage for my daughters two cockatiels. She had no problems setting it up by herself. It is very large and good quality .It even has space for the bird food and other items under the bottom tray. She is happy with it and so are the birds. Best cage ever for my parakeets. ", "Took about 35 to 40 minutes after laying out the parts and reading the instructions. Our first cage was bent and broken by Fed Ex after they slammed it down on our porch,so I met the Fed Ex guy at the truck as he pulled up . Great cage for the money. It took me about 45 min to put together by myself. Could be tricky for someone else alone to put together. I have four parakeets in mine and plenty of room. They love it, I keep just a couple of perches in the bottom part and they get down there to fly. They have a blast in it. And I keep all the toys and food, water containers in the upper half. we love this brand new cage we got for our new birds I totally recommend but we did have some problems cause we had to drill our own holes cause the cage did not come up with them but overall the cage was great My zebra finches love it! I like that there are so many doors making getting inside very easy. I am very pleased with this product. The only issue I've had with it is that it arrived with one of the dishes broken, but I contacted Prevue and received a replacement promptly and without any hassle. My bird loves this cage.  She was trying to nest chronically and would constantly climb to the bottom of her previous cage to shred paper through the wire grate on the bottom.  I needed to change up her environment and purchased this cage.  She took to it very quickly and loves all of the space.  It's so big I think she's too lazy now to go all of the way to the bottom.  I'm 5'2'' and it stands above me.  It is very easy to clean.  I love the shelf-- it provides a spot to store all of my bird's food and other accessories.  The wheels make it very easy to move so I can vacuum.  I would buy it again for sure. Hi everyone. I will totally recommend this item. Great quality and I think the price is the best. Not only they send me the bird cage but they also send me 3 sticks for the birds to stand up and 4 little plates to put their food. Love it. This cage is for my new family. My ringneck birds had their first babies.\ud83d\udc25\u2764\ufe0f Directions spot on didn't take long to put up. Definetly need more than one person. Only thing my slide tray has a crack in top left corner. Still usable but would like to replace it in case cracks more. Other than that truly love the cage it's space and room for my 4 parakeets. Love the cage. Fast at shipping. Update: This cage is very low quality.  Do not buy it.  It is not worth the hassle of putting together or the poor quality.  The cage is already rusting in several spots which caused some of the support bolts to weaken.  The bottom grate and tray keep falling out and it is not safe.  Spend the money on something with better construction. A little bit of a puzzle putting it together, but once assembled, I've been very happy with this product.  My birds are even happier, now they can get the exercise they need for good health.  It was delivered quickly and everything was in the box...I ended up ordering a second one. ", "the issues on the cage top was not correct,but once the cage was assembled ,I did what I could do to hide the issues on top of cage.lots of room for our 3 birds to have room to fly. Cage was a bit hard to put together on my own. I highly suggest having someone with you to help when you put it together!  I really like it, but my only pet peeve is that he large doors are on the bottom of the cage rather than the top, so it's extremely hard to get to my bird, who prefers to stay at the top part of the cage. Worst!!! My father (a mechanical engineer) was helping me put this together and it was hell on earth. To make matters worse, there were multiple locations that were not drilled correctly so we couldn't even get the screws in!! Cage materials were flimsy and bent, there's no way this is wrought iron. I'm so disappointed...I bought this so my cat wouldn't be able to knock down my budgie's cage... It\u2019s worth every penny. I highly recommend this cage. It was not easy to put together though. My two budgies are quite contend. Good cage for my parakeets but doesn't lock well on the doors or feed openings. A bigger bird could easily push the doors open or unlatch the main doors. I breed American budgies, and boy does this cage do the trick. I have this cage and one 18x18x30 cage. This is the PERFECT flight cage for my little budgies! The only problem I saw was that one of the bars on the top panel wasn't welded correctly, but this can easily be fixed with some crazy glue. And apart of the top was a bit bent but we worked around it. Overall it is a freakin' awesome cage! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! For the price this is a very nice bird cage.  It goes together very easily, maybe 10 minutes of assembly time.  It is very sturdy.  Only complaint that I have is that the bottom tray insert is not the correct size - too small.  Pretty annoying, had to throw it out. Came today a little hard for me to put together. But it came out nice,and my lizard likes it now I'm working on decorating it. So my lizard can spend more time outside with me. I'm so glad I bought this cage.  Easy assembly.  Sturdy cage.  My cockatiels sang so happily when I moved them in. I love the cage so much it was so much fun assembling and my 4 cockatiels love it! HOWEVER, upon arrival one of the feeder cups was broken on the hinge where you hang it up to the cage. Now one of my cockatiels has to eat out of a different feeder and feels left out. Really wish they sold a replacement. Oh well. ", "I love this cage. It includes all your bird needs for the first days. A little annoying to put together but was expected with it being the size it is. The only problem is that I would've preferred there be a large door on the top half so that I can hang the birds toys more easily and position the perches more directly. The cage itself is solid, its made of decent sturdy metal, but don't expect solid steel or iron/bronze. The cage is lightweight enough that pushing and pulling is easily done and the wheels means I don't have to rattle the cage to move it. There's enough room in it to fit either two to three large birds like parrots with enough play room, or several smaller birds should you want a nice colony of them. Very Very Nice Cage. Just prefect period. I received my cage in two days. From the first piece of tape cut to open box to the cage being fully assembled and where it was going to sit took 40 minutes by myself to assemble. The cage is nice and perfect for our four parakeets. I recommend this cage with no negative thoughts toward it. Extremely easy assembly by one person. GREAT size, super easy to move around (even on carpet), and shipped SUPER fast.  Highly recommend. I use it for a single cockatiel and she is in heaven with all her new space.  So nice to see her spread her wings so easily.  And it was simple to put together (did it by myself).  Only drawback are the spring-hinged side doors - she doesnt bother with them but a more energetic bird could easily push them open. My lovebirds just love this cage. I am so glad I chose this cage. It is so large and spaciouse. I bought one of these for my Society Finches, who were housed with my Zebra Finches and were hating life.  Recently, I became a parental unit(SNL) to a lost and scared Parakeet, whom I had to put in my small isolation cage.  I quickly added a second Parakeet to keep the first one happy and then realized they were hating life in that small cage.  I bought my second cage for them.  I love these cages, as I can roll them around so that they are getting lots of sunshine.  These cages are easy to clean and have lots of room to add all of the toys the parakeets can handle. Directions to be a little bit better but other than that it is a great product Nice cage with plenty of access for cleaning, etc. The instructions could have been better, the pictures are often too small to distinguish which panel they are actually discussing in the instructions. I use this cage for my black capped conure to play in during the day when he is not exploring. He loves to climb and play with the toys he has. ", "This thing is huge!! Love it and so does my one lone sugar glider.  He will be getting a friend very soon. I contacted the mfg.  R1, L1 (legs) had the tray slot welded on upside down so there is no way to have the lower try and the screen in at the same time.  they are sending me replacement parts and are aware of the issue. Roomy for our little zebra finches My canary loves it. Easy to put together and it looks good when finished! Now to go out and get some goodies to finish it off. Two of the feeders arrived broken and one of the partitions was bent and rcvd. only 2 perches. It's a beautiful cage and I can't wait to give our birds their new home! My budgies actually stretch their wings and fly a little, much more vocal and busy talking.  Cage is wicked hard to clean though Nice cage, packaging was a mess and hard to get into. Took about 30 minutes to assemble. Needed a bit of force to get pieces to fit. Excellent cage and sweet price For the price this cage is awesome.  We have several finches and they have enough room to fly around.  FYI, if you have more than 4 finches, make sure you add more perches so that they don't fight each other.  1 perch for every two birds is just perfect. I have 2 parakeets we keep in this cage and it's like a bird mansion! Bar spacing is great for them they can not fit out. It's a pain to build but I did it myself without help from my husband and it only took about 1.5 hours lol ", "I have had this cage several months now. i am 66 yrs old and in a wheelchair wit little use of my right arm. I LOVE THIS CAGE! I did need someone to assemble it which took about 30 mins. and was not complicated. directions and diagrams were easy to follow. This cage is HUGE and my year old Cockatiel just loves it. This cage is easierfor me to maintain than the little parakeet cage i used to have which i had to pull and tug with my good arm to get the bottom tray out clean. THIS one is SO EASY for me! The bottom slides out so smoothly. i cover itwith paper towels so i just roll them up with the seeds and messes my bird makes, toss them in the trash and reline with fresh paper towels. Thats easiest for me. There are other easy ways to clean it in other reviews that are great as well. The tray is very large of course but INCREDIBLY LIGHT so i can put it in and out with my one good arm.And the cage is on wheels so it can be moved room to room or even outside! Kind of cheaply built, but will work for the price. My 2 parakeets love all the room they have to fly around. It is perfect. Thank you. Very nice sturdy cage. Easy to put together solo. Great size cage I've bought two of these and am about to order a third. Some is partly bent, but not badly enough to effect putting it together. Check for sharp spots before putting your animal into it. You can file them down Definitely easier to assemble with two people.  Not a spendy cage but nice. My Birdie is Happy and so am I he loves having a bigger cage. I love all the little doors all over the cage. Didn't come with instructions but i put it together by myself. My bird loves it and it's very sturdy Great cage for a great price, houses my doves and easily cleanable. Very spacious as it is for parrots but works even better with smaller birds. Definitely recommend! ", "I really like this flight cage for the price. The only issue I had was that one of the holes was not drilled out right because I had to put a screw in diagonally to get it to catch. But other than that it is great. My 4 parakeets love it, lots of room for them. The shelf on bottom is nice too. For the price and size its ok. I bought it for my two sugar gliders and it works. But it did come with a part of it not fully welded on the top, and most of the doors on the sides are welded shut, which is fine for me since i zip-tie them closed anyway. The side doors also don't have a lock on them they just swing open. The size and quality are great at any price but for $88 it is a steal.  As others have noted the instructions could be larger with parts labeled but I had no problems assembling within 30 minutes.  I did have one side piece that had 2 holes on the wrong side but it was easy to drill them through.  11 Finch's love their new home! Quite dispointed! On One of the two back panels, found the wire mesh is broken and a bit blended. One of the feed bailed is also broken and can not be hanged on the cage.  These damage were  not caused by shipping and packing problem, they were defective and seller either did not mentioned it or didn't do a quality control check! The birds still scream in the morning at the same top corner so I\u2019d say this cage seems to suit their needs. first cage received broken, replacement cage received broken, after 2 broken cages we  decided to keep 2nd broken cage, I would suggest buying from another vendor entirely, product claims to be wrought iron, I don't know what it is made from but it is certainly not wrought iron. Definitely not worth the money. As listed I was soooo worried when reading these reviews. I was so anxious waiting for it to arrive. I am a breeder and have purchased many cages - assembled at least 50 and this was by far the worst. The design is flimsy at best and outright dangerous for small birds like finches or parakeets. The bar spacing is listed as 1/2 inch - however - at the points where two panels meet there are bigger gaps. The screw holes on my cage were often drilled at an angle which made assembly very difficult. The bottom legs are slightly crooked and it took some major strength to force apart far enough for the bottom shelf assembly. The door closures are a joke: a metal rod  that slides up - I know that many birds will eventually figure out how to open their cage or get their bands caught on the rod. Perfect little big flight cage! My whole family approves. ", "Easy to assemble and nice, high quality.  The doors and openings are conveniently located for easy access to different parts of the cage.  FYI the bottom has the same as the sides, so you can't keep quail etc. in the bottom. Great cage for Birdie!!! Great Cage for a Great Price..... Parakeet loves it....... I love the size of this cage for price .my girls ( two cockatiels) are really enjoying their new play house :) however be very carful with the feed trays the prongs break extremely easy :( but r great other than that.  I has a couple wires that wasn't welded right either and that aggravated me to pieces one  was not welded good on the tray at the bottom and two more on the small wiring in the bk but honestly u can't  tell and it's still safe and I'm the only one who knows because I set it up . All in all I would repurchase if was asked so yes I recommend it.  I couldn't get the petstore to order this exact cage for the price  don't forget your coupon ;) oh it's also easy to clean and all the doors are very handy . I bought two cages for my pollitos! And it's perfect!! The assembly wasn't that difficult, but I do recommend at least do it with an extra person. The size is perfect for my cockatiels. I do think that in one cage is enough for four or five cockatiels, I'm happy with this product! While a very good bird cage the instructions leave a lot of lacking as it was very difficult at first to assemble as the pieces are not marked or labeled Thank you Amazon I know those kind of aviary cages go for hundreds of dollars God bless and your wonderful company love shopping and saving money We ordered the large one and it is pretty big it's not bad for the price it's sturdy my sugar gliders love it it was really actually easy to put it together there were no damages to anything in the Box everything came out perfectly fine Great Cage for the price, amazed on how easy to put together. My 9 year old Son and I put together and only took less than 30 minutes. Our 4 Parakeets Love this cage and plenty room. Perfect cage and size for the price.My 3 indian ring necks love it!Just one of the dish trays was broken when it arrived. ", "I received this cage on April 21st. Two lovebirds are housed in the cage. The bottom tray has already broken, only had a sheet and millet seed in a small bag. Nice cage for the price. I purchased to use for Sugar gliders. The little doors on side can be open by them, so had to Zip tie them shut. It doesn\u2019t seem to be very sturdy/hardy, but it works for the price. In a bind, I\u2019d buy it again I'd buy it again! A bit difficult to put together, but not all that bad. Perfect cage for my crazy kakariki! I ordered the XL ones and it's so much room. Great cage! Very sturdy construction and excellent design.  I put it together in my livingroom by myself with no problem.  The only time I needed assistance was when a panel needed a little support while tightening the bolt, but I used a bread bag twistie to hold the panels together temporarily.  For the price, this is a really great buy. I just got this today. Shiping was fast. Was concerned at first as the box was tore up butnall parts were fine. Easy to put together. 30 min top. My budgies are sooooo happy singning and chirriping.  LOVE THIS CAGE You can't beat this cage for the price. My 2 parakeets and conure like the extra space. The wheels allow you to move it around easily. Is it a high quality cage, no, but it works and looks good. Takes forever to put together... But love it..  :-) What I especially like about this cage is all the doors both large and small.  Another type of cage I have has one large door in the middle of the front and one small door on each end.  The Prevue cage has two large doors on the front and 3 small ones on each end.  It makes it so easy to reach food containers and clean perches.  I really would like another if I had room. EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! I hope my new birds take advantage of all their space! You can fit several parakeets in here, and larger birds too. Easy to put together, decent quality- especially for the price. I honestly love it. As long as the birds all get along, this is ideal. The next best thing to an actual \"walk in\" aviary. ", "I bought this to give my 3 parakeets room to fly around. They mostly stick to the top part of the cage, but there is plenty of room and they do enjoy it. They cage includes some great food dishes and the assembly is easy to follow. Great cage for the price. Would purchase from them in the future. Love that it's on wheels. easy to roll from inside to outside. I love it and my birds love it! The only reason we're giving it a three is because the end result is good but this was the worst thing to put together ever! THE WORST! Seemed a bit flimsy going together but it works fantastic for sugar gliders.  Much larger than their previous habitat and strong enough for them I love the space my birds have in this flight cage.  Lots of room to move toys around.  Easy to clean!  I would have two people to help put it together. This cage would be great for very small birds that like a lot of room, but it is not a good cage for larger birds. I have a Parret and he can bend the weak bars but climbing on top of the cage. The cage also has 6 spring loaded feeding doors. My bird was able to push them open because the springs are small and weak. The cage looks nice but isn't fit for large bird use. My birds and I love this cage! Easy to move from room to room (we follow the sun), easy to clean, lots of room, excellent quality. The cage was a little challenging to put together. It takes 4 hands to erect, took 30 mins. to complete.. Very sturdy and well worth the money. Instructions where not simple ", "This cage came quickly and was in great shape did not have any damaged parts or missing parts my husband said the trick was figuring out what went where but he figured it out and all 4 of my finches love this cage placing your own perches inside is no problem my husband made some from outside was a great price for this cage as well Awesome, best cafe ever, birds love it, room for toys and flying around. This cage is exactly what we needed for our two doves. The cage itself is a little flimsy and the last back piece was a pain in the neck to get in because you would get the pins in then move out of place on the other side. I battled with it for a good 15 minutes. All in all it\u2019s a great buy! This cage is nice because it has a lot of room but if I had to do it over I would have bought my green cheek conure one of the heavier wired cages that preview has to offer. I think this cage is better suited to finches or for parakeets. This is a very large cage and could house several birds. This was generally easy to build, and is the perfect size for my mynah to fly in. This cage was great for the price. You can't find a cage this size for $125. However, the quality of the cage isn't the greatest. The metal is weak and not all of the welds are strong. Some of the wire were bent and one wasn't even welded. The handle on the slide out cage on the bottom was bent unevenly so it looks crooked. The directions are just silly, but if you have any common sense it isn't difficult to put together. Despite the quality issue, it is a great cage for small birds like finches, but no bigger than a parakeet because a stronger beak will tare it apart. I like this cage and so does my baby. My parakeets love it but it was kinda tough to put together. Happy parakeets. Lots of room to play. I bought this for my mom's finches. I think it took us maybe 30 minutes to assemble. It was very easy and the instructions were clear for once. They absolutely love the space to fly in as there is a dozen of them. Its easy for my elderly mother to clean. ", "Horrible to put together. Missing the right piece to finish putting it together. Flimsy. Never finished putting the cage together I give this all 5\u2019s across the board!  Our little Finches are so happy with all the extra room.  The assembly was easy to understand and the strength of the cage is very sturdy and to be on rollers is awesome!!! A lot bigger than expected and only one part was dented on arrival, but it isn't noticeable. Extremely easy to put together and I did it by myself. My birds live the space in this cage! Lots of room for toys and food dishes! Size is right Finch flight cage.  3 pairs are very comfortable This is a beautiful cage! It only took about 20 minutes to put it together as long as you take your time and sort out the cage sides. My two budgies love their new space! Now for some new toys! Actually for the $$ I was VERY satisfied with the cage and the size! It'll hold up to 8 tiels VERY easy. The putting it together wil take 2 ppl. in certain places during the process, but well worth it. Only nay I have is the latches on the doors. not the easiest to get into and lock back up, and on 2 of the food dishes one of the clips that hold in onto the cage broke the 1st day, but besides that? The cage is huge and spacey and well work the $$. I wish I could write a book about this cage, but I'll try to leave out the fluff. This cage has pretty much everything I've been looking for in a bird cage. It's very well though out and must have been designed by a team that's had experience with birds. The slide out tray is deep enough for whatever you use to collect waste (I prefer pet wee-wee mats with Alpine bedding on top). But the birds can't make a mess in their waste because there's a grate, which is positioned above the collection tray. Plenty of room for the birdies to have fun, hop around and for all the stuff that comes with keeping birds. Nice, easy wipe finish, plus too many other features to list here. The only minor criticism is the latch on the main door--it's a bit odd imo. But there's not much that could take away from the 5 star rating of this cage. And let's not talk about affordability--this is a steal! It's easily worth in the $500 range, and I've seen that price in my parts. You will love this, and so will your birds! I bought this cage for my pair of budgies to give them lots of extra space to fly. It's a nice looking cage, and plenty of room for the two of them. It came with 4 large food/water dishes to hang in the cage which is great. It also came with 3 wooden perches. We had no issues assembling it, but we have owned similar cages in the past. ", "Really easy to put together. Very sturdy. My critter's love it. Plenty of room for gliding. Easy to clean and access critters. Having all supplies on the bottom shelf is very convenient. Being able to roll it out of the way for cleaning or relocation is great. Great cage It arrived broken but my husband put it in and put the birds in it so I did not return it.the part of plastic I do not like as it is completely because it does not fit well. Metal is not treated, after a few months you can see rust, one of the leg even broke off, Got the xtra large for my 3 parakeets they love the space to stretch their wings and fly pretty easy to set up with two people definitely recommend for the price. I'm very happy. This is a great bird cage for the money.  In fact, so much so that I got extra birds to fill it, and they are happy!  When I received the cage, it came without the necessary hardware to put it together.  I wrote the company and within a day I received everything I needed.  That's good customer service!  I would buy from this company again. Absolutely fantastic.  Tons of room for 2 sugar gliders and so many toys with even a lot of space to play in.  Put in together all by my self with the instructions provided easily.  No broken parts, even though the box it came in was worse for wear from shipping it.  Huge!  Love it!!! The cage itself was nice, but the tray that came with it was broken as you see in the picture. The tray is something that should be whole to maintain the cleanliness of the cage but with it being broken, it often falls out and doesn\u2019t serve its purpose. Very bummed about it. We have 7 parakeets and they all fit comfortably with plenty of room to fly around and do their thing. It's fairly sturdy, the tray is good heavy rubberized material and slides out easily for cleaning. I love that it's on wheels so I can move it around to clean under it. Would definitely recommend. Very large and beautiful cage. I received it today and am highly satisfied. Assembly took around an hour but the directions are very simple and straightforward. I am using it for my sun conure. The bars seem strong enough to to take anything that my bird can dish out. Everything arrived intact and in perfect condition. I look forward to purchasing more birdie supplies from Prevue. ", "I previously purchased 2 excellent breeder cages from this company, and so was confident about this purchase.  This cage is \"ok,\" but probably would not purchase another one.  Putting it together is tricky (have a helper if you can!).  The seed cups that came with don't fit the bars.  The slide-out tray fits onto the side rails - but barely.  On a positive note, it does clean easily (which makes me wonder what it is coated with).  It works as a holding cage for my fledglings, but I will probably shop around more thoroughly next time. To put the cage together you need two people kind of hard for one person otherwise it is a beautiful cage for small birds mine love it . Very nice cage I have 7 budgies in mine. The tray arrived broken but the manufacturer is sending a new one! Great cage for little birds. Easy to assemble. Nice roomy cage for my quaker and a green cheek conur.  Enough room for both to move around and even fly.  The wielding on this cage is weak, so you have to be careful putting it together not to break anything.  Also the bottom tray on my cage just falls off.  I just have the metal piece wrapped in plastic to repel the water and topped it with paper towel.  The feeding trays also don't sit easily on the bars so you have to apply a little pressure to make it sit tightly.  If you can adjust to these little nuisances than this cage is a good deal for the room offers your birds to move around in. This is NOT a cage for small birds like canaries, what a MISREADING description ;(( Purchased for my sugar gliders and it has perfect! Easy to clean but had a little trouble assembling. When I got this it was open Box in some of them was bent. Bab Store Love the cage for my two cockatiels.Very big and sturdy. No missing parts or damage at all. And it took me about half an hour to put together. ", "They recommend that two people assemble it.  Two people are definitely better than one when putting it together, but if there is only you and no helper, using TWIST TIES will do the trick.  Except for the back, each and every piece is unique, so lay them all out and look at them all until you understand where each piece goes.  Assembling it is then a piece of cake if you use twist ties to hold the pieces lightly together, before you tighten the bolts.  When assempled, this is a very sturdy cage and easy to keep clean. We initially purchased this cage for our parakeets, however after assembling it and seeing how big it actually was we put our  ringneck in it and he loves it. I bought this cage for my 2 quakers.  It is huge!  You have to put it together, the instructions are a little hard to follow, and you need a friend to help out, but you get the hang of it.  Nice finish.  It has 2 big doors and 4 small doors.  I took one of the small doors off for the nestbox, and it fit perfectly.  Love the wheels, makes moving the cage around so easy.  I love the cage! We wanted a cage that was big enough for our parakeets to fly around in, more space.  We had looked at other sizes, but we felt this was the one.  And it was!  Our birds are able to stretch their wings and flutter around inside.  It was easy to assembly, it came with instructions but none of the parts were stamped with any indicators..i.e. ,A,B, C. D.  etc. So I relied on the picture on the box to help me assemble it.  It is  sturdy and I like the casters, I can move them outside with ease.  I would recommend this product very highly. The cage itself is very beautiful. I have two main complaints.. Amazing value - love that it rolls for sweeping bird messes- perfect for my 7 parakeets I bought this cage to use for three pet rats that I was getting and it worked out great for them. The bars were spaced apart just the right amount for them not to be able to get through. This cage was also a lot bigger then I thought it was going to be which was also a plus. It is also very sturdy and I would order one again from this seller for sure. Need two people for assembly. Great cage. It's perfect! I have one Quaker and one cockatiel. They absolutely love this cage. It's a gift and a curse because now they would prefer to spend more time playing in and on their cage than hanging out with me. Haha. It makes me so happy and relieved to know that they enjoy the size of this cage because I work full time and take classes a couple nights a week, so some days they have to be in it a long time. There's so much room to reorganize toys and there is room in top of the cage to put a little play perch for when you're at home and have the cage opened. Seem like they could be better quality. Our small/medium sized bird, a cherry head conure, has broken bars on her door because they are too weak for her beak. The green cheeks can't bend and break the bars like her though. ", "Easy assembly, rolls easily, storage is convenient. Good cage, the only two objections I have is that there is no way to secure the side doors - a bird can push that open and fly out , which seems a bit odd to me. So now  I have  a ton of clothespins on the cage to prevent that.  The other thing is that the silver tone disappears where bird droppings fall on it.  Still, definitely worth the money spent on it. Very well made for a small bird flight cage. This is the best cage. It was easy to out together with the help of my son, the roof is a little tricky if you're short like me. My birds live it, and the quality is outstanding. I'll have this cage for years to come. This is really a great cage! Very well made and easy to assemble.  Has wheels to move it around, lots of doors for easy cleaning or rearranging. I have lovebirds in one and just bought a second one for parakeets! Plenty of space for them to fly around. Overall nice cage.  There was a panel that had a stripped out screw inner piece.  My husband could redrill and fix it but it would not be able to come apart again.  So I called amazon and they offered to replace the whole thing or refund $30 of the $104 i paid.  I figured with shipping and time since it was overall a minor problem we kept the cage and my husband fixed it.  It will not have a resale value in the future but I intend on keeping it so I am happy with the out come. Nothing is labeled, stickers with A B C, etc would be extremely helpful. This cage was really well packaged and easy to put together with two people. I left off a star because some of the pieces were bent and the casters required a hammer to make them flush. i have four of these. the newest model is nice, i like the improved front doors. a bit too small for my wife, but my dove fits perfectly. While most of the cage is very good, the legs are not very sturdy. Within weeks the legs buckled on one side so that it has to be shoved up against the wall. That made the tray not stay in place so we have to hold it with a large clip to keep the tray in. I'd look for a sturdier product. It\u2019s a great cage until you get some little bugs crawling in between the holes and once it becomes infested...it\u2019s difficult to get them out completely. Had this for a year but now we are getting rid of it because of this situation. ", "Plenty of room for multiple budgies and toys.  Well made and easy to move around to window or out of the way to clean under the cage.  Would buy again for sure. I love this cage. Me and my dad put this together today and I'm SO HAPPY with the result. It's not too big (I know that sounds like a bad thing) because it doesn't protrude too much into my room making me still be able to move. It's almost as big as me at 5'5 and can't wait to get my green cheek baby! I will update my review when I get my bird. (If I remember to) Cage is nice and good sized for sugar gliders but some parts arrived bent and dinged up.  Cage also rusts and is cheaply made.  There are better cages out there.  I would skip this one. I have had this cage a little over a year and would tell you to save your money!!! The cage has rusted and I now have to keep it together at the bottom of the cage with zip ties.As I move it it wobbles back and forth and the bottom of the cage falls out. The price has dropped by 20.00 form when I bought it and I still would tell you save your money!!Very poor quality!! This is the perfect home for my 1 oz parottlet.  Lots of room for lots of toys, exactly what a parott needs. Arrived very quickly. It took some time to assemble. Very roomy and sturdy. It's held up just fine since we purchased it. The parakeets seem to love it as they have more space.  Moderately priced too! Was pleasantly surprised by how nice the cage looks. Went together easily with the included tool. Huge. Inexpensive. Decent quality. Pretty. Can't beat this for the price. Easy to put together. Great product This cage should not be marketable. The wire is so weak any bird can get out of the side spring doors, main doors, and easily snap the bars or bend them and get stuck in them.

Very nice cage for multiple parakeets. Only thing is some of the parts are rough and need filed down to fit. (Like the lock.). Huge cage! Easy to put together. Used for our sugar gliders I had finches that were breeding so I wanted a roomier cage for them. This is so perfect. Now they all have plenty of room to fly around and have their own spaces. The color is much better than described as well. It has a silver fleck on it, so it looks very nice. The shelf on the bottom is perfect for storing food and extra dishes and bath supplies. Some hinges were missing on the doors. One of the 5 feeding cups was broken. Customer service did not respond. On a positive note, the bird loved the extra space.  It is as large as a 4-drawer upright dresser. Spacious enough for my bird to stretch his wings and  fly around. Easy to roll / move around. Has a lot of doors for easy access. Great cage, great price. It was easy to put together just make sure you follow the instructions. My boyfriend installed the doors backwards at first, but he didn't even glance at the instructions. The only thing I don't like is that the metal seems a little flimsy. This thing is awesome! I bought for my sugar gliders and they play sooooo much more! I assembled it myself pretty quickly. I'm about 5'1 and it's about the same height as me. One of the trays came cracked but I only needed 2 so not a big deal. It\u2019s a nice and sturdy cage. My birds love It. ", "Love this cage. amazing for the price. very big. its a mansion for my two green cheek conures. the side doors are very handy for hanging toys and perches in the back. they do not lock but havent had any escapes. you could always zip tie them or something though if you are nervous about that. GREAT DEAL. I received this cage today. Some of the sections were bowed. I got 3/4 the way putting it together and noticed a solder point is broken and a hole is too small the thread the screw through it. So now I still don't have a bigger cage for my Canaries. This has to be the absolutely worst bird cage I have ever bought!!! A piece of junk!!! Be careful about how you assemble the cage, because some of the instructions are rather confusing and I did indeed assemble it incorrectly the first time around. It's mostly an inconvenience if one misassembles because of all the screws, however, when I did assemble it correctly, it was quite wonderful and provided adequate room for twenty canaries (if not more if one is in need of space). Very sturdy. I bought 2 of these , I 100% recommend for sugar gliders , bar space is perfect , easily cleanable , and the doors on the front are perfect , don\u2019t let the picture fool you , I love these cages !! It looks so good in person Great cage This cage is huge.  I have 8 green cheek conures and 7 babies in a nest.  This cage is roomy for everyone.  There\u2019s no more fighting because they\u2019re on top of each other.  They have room to fly and play with their toys and have their personal space. Our Green Cheek Conure loves her new cage.  Plenty of space for toys and movement! DO NOT BUY THIS BIRD CAGE- OUR COCATEELS HEAD GOT CAUGHT IN SPRING LOADED SIDE DOOR, AND NEARLY KILLED HIM- LUCKY TO STILL HAVE OUR BIRD- BARELY SURVIVED- TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW!! Assembly wasn't too difficult.  It rolls very easily, it's easy to remove the bottom tray, and I really like all of the access doors!  I house two parakeets in here and it's plenty of space for them to fly. I was really happy with this cage for the price, but I paid around 85$ I will check my purchase but it was around eighty dollars even I wrote that like 4 months ago  it was the best choice for the price but now it\u2019s over 50$ more I wanted to buy another one but not any more. ", "The parts were clearly for specific levels and a couple glances at the adequate instruction sheet gave the rest of the needed information for quick assembly. Took my time and only had to ask my daughter once for her set of hands. Perfect home for my cockatiel. Plenty of room inside and on top for her to play and stretch out. I put it together by myself but would recommend an extra person to lend a hand if available. Good cage. Lots of doors and four food dishes. I had some problems mounting it up. Pay special attention to the holes on the various panels as it is easy to use the wrong parts or use the right part upside down. After a year, it has also started to rust, so remember it is not rust proof. So initially the bottom tray (catches the seeds and mess) arrived warped and cracked, I contacted Amazon in order to try to get a replacement part.  They said I would need to send the whole cage back.  I decided I would just live with it instead of going through the trouble of sending back such a large cage.  After getting fed up with the bottom being broken and falling out on occasion I decided to check the manufacturer.  I emailed them, they requested a receipt, and within two days I had a replacement tray.  This company has excellent customer service.  I will certainly be looking into their pet products for my future needs. I ordered this cage for my 2 quaker's. Very big and spacious, overall satisfied. My birds enjoy it. The cage is perfect if you are housing several birds. I definitely needed a skirt for the bottom of my cage, my birds fly a lot and does does all the other stuff along with it. Price, space and quality were my main concerns buying a flight cage. Shipping was very quick, I got it within 3 days. The directions were a little confusing at first, but I was able to put it together myself with ease. I would recommend having 2 people during assembly as it would be a lot easier, but if you have the patience you can do it yourself. It's a pretty well built cage, a few pieces were bent and the \"lock\" that holds the tray in the bottom was garbage. Somebody at the factory screwed it up and it just dangles there. Overall a good buy, for a decent sized cage. I don't see the big deal about this cage. The wire is flimsy and I don't like the gap around all of the panels. With a little effort a small bird could get his head stuck in one of them.  The size is good but that's about it. A couple of the panels aren't completely straight. At this price point there are better cages available.  I would not buy it again. The bottom catch  tray needs to have  widre  edges  as keeps slipping and falling  down /The food tray hooks on back of them  to hang in cage  to not  match the wire pattern  to attach  them  and cannot be attached.  as a cage  wire always  in way to hook them to cage. ", "This is my second one of these. I have budgies in one and diamond doves in the other.  They are great cages giving these birds space to fly.....so important for our little winged friends. I will probably buy one more in the future.  They are versatile with plenty of access to the interior and a \"good buy\" for cockatiels, budgies, doves, canaries and finches. Highly recommend. This cage is perfect for my two parakeets. They have plenty of flight space and places for toys. Great for canaries. I have 4 in one cage and they love the space to flutter around! Although it was a pain to put together, this is a huge cage that looks great.  It is a cockatiel mansion!  I was worried about the doors that don't lock, but they have springs and don't present an issue.  The only problem I had with it was that it arrived with a cracked tray, but other than that it's great. Easy to assemble and sturdy. We'll see how it stands the Florida elements outside in the patio, but so far so good. No signs of rust. The perches included fit perfectly Love it perfect size I read some bad reviews but decided to take a chance because of the price. This is a very nice and big cage! I have no complaints at all. Glad I purchased it. I keep my parakeets in it and they have so much room! Great price and cage. For the price, you really can't go wrong. I have 3 parakeets and they seem to love the extra play space. The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is that the doors on the sides don't have locks or latches. I ended up putting some bread ties on them. The directions say that you should have a partner to assemble it, but I did it alone in an hour. I bought this car for my two sugar gliders.  They were trapped in a small cage for a year before I rescued them.  They have a blast jumping all over the cage.  I had to ziptie the slide doors closed but I hope to purchase another one in the future and extend the cage.  Also easy clean up to take a large wheel in and out of the bottom. Needed to replace my sugar gliders cage and this is PERFECT.  Have it had it about a month now.  We did have to wire tie the doors where the bird food dishes would be which isnt a bad thing, just a thing. Cleaning is easy, the floor slides out as well as the tray for easy access/cleaning. Large enough the critters get to bounce n soar all over the place! ", "Thrilled !! with this cage. its, Huge!  & comes with  four long & well designed double feeding  Throuhs & 3x extra long & sturdy wooden perches,  On wheels , & can move around  with ease ,if needed .Easy to assemble with Good  Detailed  Instructions .  Delivery was Extremely Prompt .  A total bargain at this price.  Thanks Prevue!:) I bought this for my sugar gliders after doing A LOT of research. They love it. Plenty of room for them to play in. I tested all gaps in the cage and its glider safe. Wasn't hard to put together at all. I did most of it on my own till my roommate came home and with her help it got done in ten minutes. And the price was great. Most economical price for the quality I could find. This is a great value for the price. I have 4 lady gouldians in this cage and two nest boxes (plastic) in the openings. Had to get creative to make the nest boxes fit correctly but nothing that couldn't be easily fixed. A very nice, affordable cage. Assembles fairly quickly, though 2 people are needed. Solo assembly would be possible, but extra difficult. Plenty of room for small birds. Easy to clean. Excellent for price, large cage. Put together easily. On wheels which is a plus. Easy to clean slide out tray. Great deal for the price.  My birds (5 cockatiels) and I are very happy with it.  Well made.  For me, a nightmare to assemble.  Provided instructions were tolerable....physical items doe not have any label on them to match drawings.  Takes 8 sets of hands to assemble, or one fuming me.  But got it together, and am very happy with it. Love this cage. Its perfect for my 6 budgies. Lots of usable space. Only thing I'd change is it needs a bigger front door, but otherwise i love it! The cage is really nice.  However the instructions for assembling it could have been better...none of the pieces were marked, which would have been nice.  Overall very happy with this purchase Well built cage.  I put it together myself in about 1 1/2 hours.  Great size.  Would definitely recommend.  Only issue I had was one of the feed dishes was broken. Really big easy to put together when you get to the top can be done with one person but would be a lot easier with two ", "We call this our Conure's condo not his cage. he loves the size and all the different toys we got from Amazon that we put it in. My wife does switch out the toys every few weeks so he won't be bored and I did get some multi-colored braided rope at a local hardware store to put across the condo. Perfect for my Quaker Three years of owning this and it is still standing! Not as strong though. We have one weld that broke. It is not a devastating break but, it did happen. This cage is still a good budget friendly cae. Exactly what I was looking for my pet cockatiel. I love it! For the money this cage is a fantastic deal.  We keep 7 zebra finches in it and they have plenty of room.  I replaced the dowels that come with it with some real branches.  Not hard to put together... I did it myself except for top piece where it was easier with another pair of hands. I loved everything about this cage and how spacious it is!!! If you\u2019re looking for a cage and don\u2019t know if you should get this one you definitely should!!! It was easy to put together and the directions were very clear. This is my first customer review after using Amazon for years, and this cage drew me to write a comment. This is BY FAR the best deal I've found for cages.  If you want BIG at an affordable cost, this is the cage for you. Got this for our sugar glider baby\u2019s and we love it great size super sturdy! Easy to put together Great cage! Very big! Lots of room for my 2 sugar gliders:-) Very Satisfied! My parakeets love it! ", "I bought it because it describes it as for cockatiels ..... but the thickness of the cage is too thin for them ..... it would be great if they describe it for smaller birds. i have had this cage for about a month and a half. This cage come with everything that it said it would and all parts easy to build took about 40 minutes 6 very good small breeder box doors for easy access and two big doors in the front but the top door was messed up and is harder to open than the bottom one a large shelf for storage very big cage my parakeets love it i have four and there is tons of room to fly around and large food/water bowls big enough for three of them to fit and eat while the other one is eating somewhere else and the bowls r divided so i can use seed and veggies to eat excellent cage with one problem thanks for reading Very pleased with this cage.  Easy to assemble and really a nice size for my 2 cockatiels. Has many door openings and is sturdy and attractive. Nice size to allow my cockatiels to fly around and move from perch to perch. We hung this from the ceiling and left off the wheels- works for me!  Great price,too. Very sturdy especially if u have other animals not too bad to assemble and a lot cheaper than the pet store Very perfect size for my sugar gliders it\u2019s like a mansion to them. They have room to glide and jump around with no issues. I find they come out more often because they are able to. Great value for a cage this size. However the instructions are terrible. I am pretty handy and this took me nearly an hour. Now as other reviewers have said, the bottom sliders are welded upside down which took me a half hour to figure out. I will contact company about this. You can't slide in bottom tray and bottom grill for birds to walk on. The rails are reversed. Pretty bad manufacturing flaw. Will update review after I talk to company. This is absolutely awesome. I have 3 Diamond doves in it and they are extremely happy. They have more than enough flight room. They are no longer on the bottom of their cage. They are cooing constantly. This is a great product. Love it. This cage is the perfect size for my two sugar gliders lots of room...goes together easy...I am totally thrilled that I bought this one the price was awesome and definitely worth it My Quaker parrot does great in his new cage. It's easy to put together  and clean Love it for my sun conure!! Perfect big size,  lots of room for toys food and the parrot.  Our conure loves it!!! ", "Wonderful cage! Large, very well made! Looks great. Packaged securely so pieces were all in good shape! Great value and well built It's a nice size cage for a few finches.  It's easy to assemble.  I like it very much. Received the product damaged. Feeder trays are very cheap and were broken when arrived. The doors were not securable as it arrived and missing a latch. I am giving 2 stars because I was able to return to receive full refund. And the cage is actually a roomy, large cage. Cage came one day after it was ordered and one day quicker than expected.  The bird seems to love her space.  Came without damage though one of the plastic trays had damage.  So I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if I was being hyper critical. I'm very pleased with this cage.  I have 2 cockatiels in it.  They have plenty of room to move around.  Biggest plus was putting it together.  All the holes matched up.  I did not swear even once.  That must be a record. Looks nice. To bad item was shipped after the original delivery date and both the box and item were heavily damaged. 1 door is very bent and the bottom tray is broken. My two lovebirds love their new cage. My kids put it together since I just had cervical spine surgery. Plenty of room for them to fly around and act like the silly birds that they are. I wouldn't use this cage for larger birds as the bars can be bent easily, but possibly up to a quaker or conure would be appropriate, the bar spacing is small enough for even finches to live in this cage safely. I now own 2 of this cages. There perfect for birds like cockatiles and parakeets! Tje cage arrived without damage. In a brand new factory packaging was fairly esseybto assamble. Like some of the other buyers said this is a bit hard to put together but is a great cage. Lots of space there for 2 conures. ", "I did some research thru all the products available & found good reviews on this cage, so I decided to buy it. I really needed a bigger one (5 parakeets) but also needed something sturdy (2 cats!) I really had very little trouble assembling it myself, it took about an hour. I did not put the wheels on - was afraid any cats bashing at the birds would actully send the cage across the floor! It's easy to get inside to clean, feed & interact with the birds. Love this cage & reccommend it to everyone! Good sized cage which provides plenty of room for four cockatiels very easy to clean. I an considering to buy another for the other two cockatiels. Very easily assembled. I ordered this cage withthe intention of purchasing a quaker parrot to live in it. When it arrived I was impressed with its size!!! I could have several Quakers comfortably living in this cage and they would all have room to move around and play!! As other reviews state, the doors would need to be better secure for a smart bird like a quaker, however, they would be just fine for parakeets, canaries, or finches. Putting it together was very easy. A lot of the reviews said it was difficult and time consuming, but I'm an overweight woman in my 50s and I put the cage together in about 30 minutes with no help. The instructions aren't the best but common sense should kick in and fill in the gaps that the intructions leave out. A couple of the wire bars were bent but easily straightened with a pair of pliers. The cage is sturdy and looks great! I love that the bottom shelf and wheels are a part of the cage and NOT a seperate stand. I've found that when a large cage is sitting on a seperate stand it's open to be knocked over by grandchildren or large pets (especially Great Danes)  I loved this cage so much I bought a 2nd one and plan to breed Gouldian Finches. Couldn't be happier with the purchase!! We just have two zebra finches, I know this cage is overkill but it works great for them to get to exercise and move around. Excellent. I got the Large size and I have 6 regular sized budgies in it. I am looking to get an English budgie or 2 to also go in it but later on sturdy. lots of doors for easy access. Easy to put together,  lots of doors for easy access. We use this cage for our chameleon Rango :) This is exactly what I needed, was easy to put together and gives the parakeets much needed space to move around even with their toys hanging in it:) Great cage! My 3 rats love it, has so much room for them plus the bar spacing is perfect! Light cage it says you need 2 people to put it together i did it by myself but id be easyer with 2. No problems with bent wires and such. All around awesome deal for the price. I have had this for over 1 year. My birds love this cage. I am sure they feel like home. The extra extra room gives enough space to spread their wings. Rollers make the cage easy to move it while cleaning. The bottom rack is useful to store bird food and toys. I do Not recommend this cage for birds any larger/stronger than Cockatiels. ", "parfait pour mes 2 gris d'afrique quand je suis en vacances en floride This is a beautiful, sturdy cage.  It was 2 hours of pure hell to put together, but definitely worth it.  Now I just need to find some canaries to put in it!! My husband didn't think the large parakeet cage we had for our 2 parakeets was large enough. Well let me tell you this one is large enough for me to get in if the doors were bigger.  But, it's nice for the birds as they can get lots of exercise flying around the cage. Cage is a PITA to put together. Feeder trays broke in first week and don't fit properly between the cage bars. One of the bars was not welded properly so I can to solder it in place and then plati-dip the area. Many pieces arrived bent or warped.  I'm really disappointed.  I would not recommend purchasing this,  I  wish I  hadn't. What a lovely large size cage preferably fitted my 6 parakeets very easy put to gather I\u2019m so Happy comes before time Thank u Amazon \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Great buy for the price. I paid 98 dollars. Nothing was broken during shipping. Only advise is to not go crazy tightening the screws while assembling. Assembly Instructions could have been better though. Great cage, materials and size. None Great item. Baby Quaker loves it. It fits her well.

It was easy to assemble and it looks nice especially for the price. I took one star away because one perch came in a wrong size, much shorter and seed catcher pieces have large dents/bent but they fit. I wish that the seller would do a better job of a quality control before shipping the cage.  However, DON'T BUY THIS CAGE FOR PARAKEETS due to a very large space between bars opposite of what aviary bar spacing recommendation 1/2\" or less between the bars for small birds such as: parakeets, lovebirds, finches.  I wasn't able to put my parakeets inside of this cage because the space between bars is not safe/suitable for their little feet. Even my 2 green cheek conures, that is considered to be a medium sized birds, were struggling to walk at the bottom of the cage but I was able to adjust the issue by putting the bottom piece from their old cage that is smaller in size just on top of a new cage's bottom. Now, they can walk and they seems to be happy. This cage is perfect for sun conures, cockatoo and macaws. I would NOT recommend this cage for smaller species. Also, DO NOT buy this cage if you have a cat due to large space between bars, your cat will be able to fit a paw in between bars and kill the bird inside the cage*** In love with this item! I ordered the 61\" version and it arrived on time and in the expected condition. My item was packaged very conscientiously and protected well, so I have not experienced what other customers have with parts of the item arriving damaged or bent. I bought this for my cockatiel Sonny, and the construction is definitely sturdy enough to prevent him from bending the bars (read some reviews that this was flimsy? Maybe for a larger bird...). It would have to fall on its side to bend significantly, in my opinion. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure so it is perfect (I actually have 2 of these cages). It is 18\" wide in the front, 18\" deep on the sides, and just the cage part is 33' tall. This cage is ONLY appropriate for small birds like conures, cockatiels, budgies, etc. An amazon, african grey or senegal like the advertisement says would NOT fit in this cage!!!!!!!! Be sure to read the dimensions when purchasing a cage. My friend and I put it together, we sorta followed directions but we would put things in backward and have to undo them and put in correctly. We laughed and laughed for I don't know 30 mins. We put my lovebird in it and it was great. He kept going around trying the bars to see if could escape, he never could. While I watched over the next few days,  I realized he really only used the top 10 inches. So I bought a different style cage for him, and put my conure in it.  He had come with his own crappy cage, this cage was great for him. He loves going up and down while inside it and I can leave door open and he easily comes out and climbs to the top, King of the Mountain. Also the cage itself is beautiful. When my brother and his gf came to look at it, they spent 15 mins just admiring and commenting on how beautiful and cool this cage was. This was also the first time they saw the conure. He was so far below the cage I really don't recall them commenting on the bird at all, just on the cage itself. So if your worried you will have trouble putting it together, get a happy laughing type friend over to help and you will have fun. We did not have any of the problems I have read in other reviews about paint filled holes and badly drilled or threaded holes, missing parts and dowels too short. Everything was there and we put it together easily, well except for the parts we put in upside down or turned around. Then we would look at the directions, AHHH now I see. LOl If I got another conure I would buy another of these cages definitely. About 11 years ago we got a Quaker parrot and bought a cage from Petsmart made of the same material this cage is. Our original cage is quite large and the wheels never quite rolled smoothly. Align the screws and nuts first! And I put wheels on LAST... The cage was both easy and difficult. I have bursitis and tendinitis and putting it together was more difficult bc of this. So I took a bunch of photos and will explain a little bit that can help you set up your cage. First you can lean either the front or back cage against the wall at an angle so putting on the side seed catcher and where the tray slides on to holders on. I hope I make sense too... I leaned the back part up and grabbed the rounded back screw put it in to connect the short and wide seed tray holder on. Then I took the flat back screw and a nut and screwed the round goes on top hole flatter back w a nut goes on bottom hole. Make sure you have the short wide side tray holder on right the top that faces up is going to have solid top with two holes an inch and half apart those holes hold wire sides in place they have two wires a posed and they fit in those holes. I then took the front cage and screwed the short wide seed catcher tray holder on. Now it can stand alone. I waited to put wheels on till end. Second I put cage wired sides on. It can be tricky. Just wiggle and pull down it may get caught a few times so pulling up again and wiggled down helps... Be careful not to bend wires. They are in the middle or flimsy and strong. They are good though and I think most birds are able to reside inside without escape... That's just me. Thirdly I put the tray wire rack on bottom of cage where photos show. And the top cage cover was a little tricky. I put two opposite sides in their holes hit down putting one in the hole at a time till the last corner was in. It has sweet spot and fits very snug. A little of the paint scraped off when I was beating it down to fit in its hole. Fourthly I picked up the stand. You put the cup holder piece on top of the two stands that are screwed on to the cage. The triangular stands you can see instructions. They use the skinny short screws. You screw that part on top with cup holders faced toward from cage. The middle screw hole that hold latter in place should be exposed toward front of cage. Then you put ladder on the bottom of ladder fits in two holes on top front cage. And the screw goes on top ladder connecting stand. Then you put wood perch the shorter one on it slides in. Do not glue bc you cannot remove cups of you do. To remove cops you'll have to take wood perch off every time. The perch is in the way. You can purchase small lipped cups that will enable you to glue perch on stand. Your choice. The cups are huge... We'll see how my bird handles them... The fifth thing I did was get the seed guard on. This was tricky at first. You put from and back one on the stay in place. Then grab a side. Grab a short wide screw and nut. Screw in top hole connecting side to back it front which side you choose is up to you. Then go to the opposite end and screw and nut in the other top hole. Then you go and screw the bottom holes to connect sides seed guard to the front and back. Now your cage is done once you put in cups perch and other things you want inside then you get to see your bird to his new bed room \ud83d\ude42 I have pictures to help. Wow this cage is everything I was expecting it to be. I was hesitant bc some of the reviews that I have read. But I am so glad I went through with it. For one shipping was so quick. Which I love bc im inpatient and mango (green cheek conure) needed a better cage.  For two it was perfect size to be moving around the house with me. There wasnt a thing wrong with any part of this product as was said in other reviews. The Only little problem I have noticed is that mango cant get a good grip on the perch in the cage which I can fix that myself. So overall mango and I are ecstatic about this cage!!! I bought exactly this product about 1/2 a year ago. Set up instructions sucked but I LOVE IT!!! ...It's still like new! ...and for those asking for the spacing on the bars.. Each bar is a dime (.10 cents) away. Very durable, assembly...they do not give step by step instructions  It took about about 3 hours because what they show as \u201cassembly\u201d isn\u2019t all the pieces and parts. I figured it out but, it was a hassle. As for construction of this cage, it really does catch most of your birds food. Which equals = less vacuuming! This cage is meant for one bird only though. The feeder and the water in the main cage, awesome! It\u2019s a way of refreshing their food and water without the bird getting out. The top, well, Lucy is still young, she only uses the top to get her wing span. Okay, so let\u2019s talk about the bottom. Easy peasy! First, I line it with paper towels. The next day, I pull it out, wrap up the paper towels, dump the seeds that are left in the trash, then Lysol the rack, dry, then re-paper towel. Sooooo easy! I was reluctant to purchase this cage, since many different companies sell the exact same cage with the exact same photos and was unsure if my African grey would fit (comfortably), but I can say that I am completely satisfied with the purchase. There were many reviews saying it's hard to assemble, but the photos are pretty self explanatory. If you have ever bought furniture from ikea and assembled it, you are well prepared to assemble this cage. Some pieces did come bent, but not to a point where you were not able to bend it back to its intended shape. Had some extra screws after assembly. Overall a great purchase. My African grey loves it!! ", "The product description lists parakeets as a breed that can go in this cage, but the bars are spaced too wide. My parakeet tried to stick its head through and scared the he11 out of me. Thank God I stopped my baby before they got hurt. I ordered the cage and had it within 5 days way before the delivery date.. I have 2 cockatiels in it and they both love this cage!! I have extra perches in it that easily and sturdily clamped to the cage.. I love the escape proof door, and the seed catcher does a great job at catching the seeds (some seeds hit the floor, but that's not completely unavoidable) I got it really fast in just 2 days, way faster than expected. The cage didn\u2019t take as long to put together as a few people stated. It way bigger then was expecting my two cockatiels have so much room. Bar spacing on the 62 in tall one is perfect. Cage bars are strong as heck even when I was trying to shove one for a perch it wouldn\u2019t budge ( a perch I added). I did leave out the barred divider so my birds can walk on solid ground. So happy I bought this. This is a disgrace ! . First, it says this is for Cockatoos and Macaws...it is NOT ! I have cockatoos and they can snip those bars right off. If I didn\u2019t need these cages (2) for emergencies or for when we have company over they would be going right back. The cages are flimsy. The majority of the holes had to be re-drilled as there paint was caked in the holes and the screws wouldn\u2019t fit . I had to adjust a lock since the latch was bent. It would have been more agrevation then it was worth to send to return them. As an avian consultant I would never ever recommend these cages for any bird larger than a cockatiel. No wonder why the guys face is covered in the ad. My Quaker lives in a significantly sturdier cage.. This ad of this cage is a misrepresentation of the type of birds being in it. This is an awesome cage for our 3 year old Cockatiel.  As many mentioned in other reviews, it came fast (within 3 days of ordering) and I have never seen any box come from China that was this well packed.  The directions were not that easy to follow and a little overwhelming; however, once I separated out the screws  and used a little common sense, it went pretty fast. I'm very impressed with this cage! First, it arrived early, so that's a bonus for my bird. The metal is strong, although two bars were slightly bent (not affecting security of cage). That may have warranted a subtraction of a star, but I'm too happy with the quality of this cage for the price. I know past reviewers stated the instructions were useless and vague; personally, I thought the one page was really simple and helpful (some things I had to interpret, like which screws were which and what pieces were where). If you're not the handiest person, I'd say grab some help and check out a past reviewer called Michii who gives some really helpful images to walk you through building it. Once built, my beebee parrot was cautious towards this cage, as she is with everything, but after I decked it out with toys and perches, she was more than happy to hop on in. I would not use this cage for budgies or smaller due to the bar spacing. Another note I'm really happy with is the inclusion of horizontal bars on the side walls! More bird cages have to catch on to this revolution; before, I was using a rat cage for my parrot with all horizontal bars, and they just make climbing for birds so much easier. Another impressive note is how the bowls are easy to remove and also cannot be flipped, as my little stinker likes to do. For my parrot, they are excessively deep, requiring her to dip her whole body down into them, but that's not a big problem. Another bonus, the dimensions of this cage are the exact size of a opened newspaper, making cleaning so much easier (yes, I know newspaper toxic, but I put it beneath the grate). The seed catcher is great, the lock on the door is easy and secure, and the play top is awesome. So to conclude, I am fully satisfied with this purchase. Buyer beware. This cage was not at al described dimensions-wise. The interior of the cage was 21x24 (lxw), and the product page itself has two different sizes (when I ordered it was just 24x24x35.5 but now there\u2019s a photo that says 17.5x17.5x35 or so), neither of which are what I got. Love this cage. It was delivered in 2 business days (before the estimated shipping dates), and it was in sturdy packaging and no damage to the product. It was super easy to put together and it looks fantastic. I wish it would have had a bit more assembling instructions, but my boyfriend and I figured it out. The seed catchers on the bottom of the cage are a lifesaver when it comes to treats and millet. My conure loves it and so do I :) It's a great product for the price. Great cage. Easy to put together (the seed guards would have been easier to screw together with two people but it was doable with one). Side notes: We removed the little metal tab that keeps the door closed when the cage door is unlocked because we found it unnecessary and in the way. The perches are too large in diameter and the two bowls on the play top are too deep for our Green Cheek Conure but that has nothing to do with the quality of the cage and shouldn't count against it. After all, all cage accessories should be customized to your bird's needs. None ", "None I would give this 3.5 stars, but rounded up because my African Gray does some to be enjoying it. One of the panels wires was stretched rather strangely, i'm sure my parrot could get his head stuck in it, or my cat could get his arm in there to take a swipe. We were able to squeeze it together with  pliers. However, the wires feel flimsy, I was worried I would break it off if i squeezed to hard. One of the bolt heads was stripped, and the hex wouldn't fit in it, we had to use pliers. The construction is not as solid as if you went to a pet store and bought a cage for 2x3 or more... the price you paid here. Then all the corners would be soldered together, the wires would be thicker etc. My parrot is a ninja, and knowing him he will just pull on the wires until they give if he knows they'll bend and escape. I hope he doesn't figure it out, he already knows how to unlock the food doors :) the perch is lose, it fits, but it slides back and forth and I will have to buy a sturdier one. I'm afraid my buddy is going to fall off it. It would be nice if their Quality Assurance would really check these items before shipping them. Got this for my cockatiel. It was quite frustrating to put together, but I also have a dog that likes to be in the middle of everything so I could have done it faster without him. He did decide to take one of the wood perches and run around the house with it. I have mixed feelings about this. I don't feel like the measurements are correct because this thing is huge. Like way bigger than I expected. I'm okay with that for the most part because I have a bird that is basically cage bound that I am working with and I want him to have enough space to be healthy and comfortable in the event that he ends up being cage bound forever. And if we never bond, there is enough room  for another bird  so he isn't lonely. But having a place prepared for this cage and then needing to find another solution because it is so big was a little bit inconvenient. I am writing this before a year is up from getting it on May 2016. It has rust already! Not what I want my African Grey to be living in! And it is in the side not bottom where water would be sitting! Very nice cage! I saw a few negative reviews and I just had to share my experience. This cage is a really nice cage and I was a snap to assemble. Very solid and I have a double yellow head Amazon in it. Honestly, if I had to keep my Amazon in it 24/7 it would be a little too small. But my bird stays on a perch outside of the cage most of the day anyway and only sleeps in the cage. I have absolutely no regrets in my purchase. It\u2019s well worth the money and it arrived several days sooner than the estimated time. Those that have complained about the instructions on assembly probably look for the instructions when buying ice trays! \ud83d\ude44 Don\u2019t hesitate in purchasing this bird cage. I can guarantee you that you won\u2019t find a price like this on a cage of this quality at your local store! This is a flimsy and horrible cage.  The cage arrived and one of the sides had several bends in the bars and one of the bars was completely broken.  The company was VERY quick in their response and they did replace the broken part very quickly but when the replacement part came it was horribly bent as well.  The replacement part was not broken and I was able to manipulate the bars kind of back into place.  The top of the cage is so flimsy that I had to zip tie the hell out of it to keep it in place...a very determined bird could easily get the top off or hurt itself pretty badly on it.  My guess is that within 5 years I will have to replace this cage...literally.  Also there is NO WAY that this cage would be suitable for a parakeet...the bar spacing it too wide and a finch would fly right out of it.  PLEASE buy a better cage. The wheels/casters on this cage left many large scrapes in my wood floor due to a seam down the middle of the wheels. We tried to find replacements for these wheels at a specialized caster store and we were told that the stem to the casters are not a standardized size that can be found in the United States. They are only made by companies in China. This leaves us with a 50+ pound cage that cannot be moved unless it is physically picked up and moved. I bought this cage as a sleeping cage for my sulfer crested cockatoo. He has a larger cage in my living room that he is housed in during the day and a cage in my bedroom which gets covered at night. Size wise this cage is adequate for what I purchased it for. It's a good size for medium size parrots. Amazons, African greys or maybe a conure. Anything smaller I think the perches are too large. Larger birds like a macaw or a moluccan cockatoo it wouldn't be large enough unless for just short term like sleeping. The cage came in the typical type box. I wouldn't say it was well packed which explains why it may have arrived damaged for some buyers. It all depends on how well it was handled during shipping. Mine came undamaged. It was relatively easy to assemble but don't count on using the instructions since all they do is give you pictures. Nothing really of value is offered in them. Mine came with all the parts and hardware - nothing missing. Everything except the left and right side panels are of a medium weight tubing and fine for the price. The left and right panels are fairly light weight. You could almost say flimsy. But once paired with the front, back and top I think the will work ok. Not sure I would want to leave my cockatoo alone during the day in it. He can be very destructive when he want to be. Not sure if the side panels of this cage would hold up. But for sleeping I think its ok. Shouldn't be a problem for smaller birds. The cage comes with a play top with 2 stainless bowls to go along with the 3 stainless bowls for the inside of the cage. These are fairly nice bowls but as others have mentioned they are really deep. Close to 4 or 5 inches or more. I didn't measure them but they are deeper than any other's I've bought in the past. A smaller bird might fall in and get lost. The only advantage I can see to them would be that if you only filled them up half way then it would be more difficult for your bird to knock food out. My cockatoo will throw food out from the top of the bowl until he find what he wants. Unfortunately a smaller bird might find it hard to impossible to reach the food or water if the bowl wasn't filled to the top. Overall I think it's a good value for the right bird and situation. I wouldn't use this as the primary residence of a large bird and it's not really adequate for small bird like a budgie or cockatiel. But for medium size birds it's a good value. Was recovering from Hurricane Harvey and wanted my cockatiel to have a nice bigger cage upon return to our renovated home, so I excitedly pre-purchased before our return home.  Disappointingly, the cage I purchased two months earlier was widely damaged upon opening the box recently.  I contacted the vendor, but no response for help in replacing dented trays, and broken and dented cage spokes, etc.  After the no response, I decided to try and deal with what I had, but in the end gave up after assembly.  It's just basically not a well made cage and all of the materials are low grade which explains why it can't ship well with out succumbing damage.  Even the food bowls are cheap and can push in at the bottom with a nice popping sound.  Overall not worth it.  The cage will be out on Wednesday's heavy trash pick-up. ", "I bought this cage 3 months before I got my adult African Grey. My husband set it up by himself. In about half an hour. It's very roomy. Though, I am going to upgrade to a little bigger cage for my CAG. I'm going to put my Conure in this cage. I am very pleased with this cage. And would recommend this for a Conure sized bird or slightly larger. Good for my CAG for sleeping cage, but would recommend a bigger one if he'll be in there more. None I saw this cage rated good for quality and price on Amazon, so I purchased it for my cockatiel.  It is not the easiest to put together.  The directions are not very detailed.  I had to take it apart once because I had put the side rails on upside down...so frustrating.  But now that it is together, it is a beautiful, roomy very nice looking cage!  So it is worth the effort.  The wheels make it all the better because I purchased the 68 inch cage and it is quite large.  The 68 inch would not be approrpiate for parakeets/finches/parrotolets, etc. as the bar spacing is too wide..  It is a perfect cage for a medium sized to large bird.  It is well constructed; all of the pieces fit; all of the hardware was included...no problems.  Great price!  Just take note when attaching the side bars; if you get them upside down, you will need to take it all apart and start over because the cage floor won't slide in properly.  The dishes are quite deep, but my Cockatiel, Maxi doesn't seem to be having a problem with them.  I really like the fact that the dishes attach to doors making it very convenient to change water/food.  The wooden perches as stated in other reviews are a larger diameter, but I will be adding other types of perches anyway...no big deal.  Overall, I highly recommend this cage--definitely! This is a sturdy cage. There is something about it that makes it very dark inside though - maybe it\u2019s the height.  The seed guards could cut you (metal) and I\u2019m a klutz so I left them off. It was really hard to figure out how to install the top play perch and dishes - didn\u2019t seem to have the right hardware. Let's start with the lock. Look at what their bad example compared to what they offer (my second photo and). Well, you'd think they wouldnt send the bad example. Look at my first picture of the lock that I received with this cage. I laughed out loud. I put this cage together by myself this afternoon.  It took about two hours altogether, and I found the diagrams in the instructions were very helpful in getting it all put together in the right sequence.  The cage is smaller than I expected, but still plenty big enough for my two keets, Jack and Jackie.  It seems sturdy enough for smaller birds - I would not recommend putting anything larger than a Quaker parrot in one of these, and even then it would be very cramped for a bird of that size.  However, as I mentioned, this is fine for my parakeets, and is replacing a cage with white paint on it that I very strongly suspect has lead in the paint.  No more white cages in my house!  The coating on this cage is a metallic silver and black, and looks pretty substantial (in other words, not pickable by birdie beaks).  However, I could not attach the seed guard because there were no nuts included in my hardware package, so I have an email in to the seller to see if they will send me some.  Other than that, all parts were there and came through shipping in good shape.  I would say that if you can get someone to help you, that would simplify the process a good bit, but it's not impossible to do on your own.  Getting started was the hardest part!  After that it was all fine.  You do have to pay attention to the way certain parts are marked in order to get them on correctly, so be aware of that unless you want to tear the whole thing down and re-assemble it again!  Overall, I would give this cage 4 stars, because of the missing nuts.  If the seller comes through with the nuts or a credit for me to purchase the nuts, I will revise my rating.  Trying to catch my parakeets and move them to their new home was far more traumatic for everyone involved than putting this cage together! This cage is awesome! Unlike their cheaper option (the $60 one), this cage is very sturdy and well made. The cheaper option was a joke. It was so flimsy and poorly made that I returned it right away.  I\u2019m very happy that I gave this cage a try. I have four dogs, and, although they are all gentle, I wanted to have a cage that was sturdy enough to keep my parakeets feeling secure and secured. What I love the most about the cage is the ease of assembly. It was so easy to assemble. The pieces fit perfectly. HOWEVER!!! Do not follow the printed instructions. It\u2019s pretty impossible to figure it out. Instead, watch their instructional video on YouTube. It shows you step-by-step what you need to do. The KEY thing is NOT to tighten the screws until EVERYTHING IS DONE. And I mean EVERYTHING. It really makes a difference because if a piece doesn\u2019t seem to fit, like the holes for the screw not matching up, it is only a matter of loosening or tightening another screw(s). I bought this cage for my son's cockatiel after reading lots of reviews of similar cages and comparing the measurements and smaller detail differences. The cage is spacious for 1 cockatiel, and could easily house 1 more very comfortably. The bar spacing is fine for this bird, but definitely too wide for budgies (parakeets). I originally wanted to purchase a new bird cage for my father in-store but every place with in driving distance we went to or called did not carry any cages this size in stock but could special order for us so I did what most people would do next I came online and ended up on Amazon browsing bird cages for the next few days until I found this cage. Which I thought was a great find for the price since my dad is disabled so he is on a fixed income. Now sadly I'm just hoping it'll last because he can't afford to buy another one anytime soon. I got this cage for an African Grey parrot that I rescued. Poor lil thing had no feathers, except on his head, and he would fall off the cage he had lived in his whole life. I wanted a cage he cops climb all over, play all over and have a foid catch tray, not just for catching the food, but for catching HIM when he'd fall. The cage worked great for most of that, but there's one serious design flaw. It's very difficult for ANY bird to climb it's way to the top. The catch tray and frame of it is too think for the bird to climb over and theres no grating for them to grab onto with either thier beak or thier feet. I've had both my Greys in and on this cage and they both have the same problem...they have to hoist themselves to get up to the top. Big stretch to bite onto the top part, then turn thier bodies sideways and spread thier lil legs to manoeuvre themselves up. The foid bowls at top SEEM like a good idea, but any bird trying to eat food out of it needs a super long neck or to climb up to the sides of the bowl to get the food. My rescue grey is a lil guy, but my other gray is huge and she doesn't even bother to get the food in thise bowls up top bc its too hard. ", "I am pretty impressed with the value of this cage. I have the name brand cage that this one resembles, which costs more, and this one compares well to that one. There are small subtle differences in the design, but overall this one seems as good as that more expensive one. The product itself is very nice and sturdy. HOWEVER, the assembly is very challenging for three reasons: This is perfect for what I was looking for. As mentioned in other reviews, the metal is very light weight, especially the side pieces. Also, the brackets to hold food bowls are not bent just right, so some are harder to get the bowls in and out of, and all mine rub on the top edge of the door hole as you open and close them. That being said,the wheels roll easily, the cage wipes down/cleans very easily, and the trays slide in and out easily. I did replace one food bowl with another stainless bowl I had that was not as deep since the ones that come with it are so deep. They work fine for water though since those get filled up more. I got this as an extra cage for my African Grey so that she has a place to hang out in the kitchen with me. She has a larger sturdier cage in another room. I didn't want to spend a fortune on a 2nd cage, so this was exactly what I was looking for! My parrot and I have been very happy with it. This is a wonderful and sturdy cage. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the bars are too big for my cockatiel to climb over. He cannot climb out the door or on top of the cage. There are not enough horizontal bars for him to gain any leverage to climb around the front or back of the cage walls. I fixed the door issue through affixing a ladder, but to be on top of the cage he must fly out, or i must put him on top. Cages should have enough room for a bird to exercise it's wings, and this cage does it.He seems to love this cage, he is very content in it. The bowls are too deep for him so I put some cardboard in the bottom to not waste so much food. Also the ladder on top was too long for screwing into the top perch, it would not bend enough. Other than the ladder issue, this is a great cage for birds bigger than a cockateil. The cage was a little tricky to put together, main thing is to take your time. The best part of this cage is the ease of cleaning. The coating on the cage, makes almost all the items to sponge right off, with very little effort. The bottom tray of the cage I just clean in the sink, and sponge clean, and wipe with a dish towel. I have a garbage disposal, so all the waste just goes down the drain. I don't bother using paper in the cage, seeing the tray cleans so easily, why waste the paper. I have a Meyer's Parrot, and the size of this cage is about right. This was the largest cage that would fit comfortably in my condo. My little guy, mainly uses his cage to eat, and to sleep in at night. The rest of the time he is with me hanging out, but when he does need to be caged bound ,because I need to leave the condo, I am so happy I got the largest cage I could. The stainless steel water and food bowls are vey well made, and are very well secured in the cage. When the cage arrived, two of the seed guards were slightly bent, but with care I bent them back, and now they look perfect, just be super careful. Nice cage,lots of room for our sun conure,fast and easy to assemble. The few things I should mention tho.We have a sun conure and for that size of a bird the feeding cups are too deep,we have to feel them up almost fool for her to easily access food and water,I bought different ones at pet store to replace the original.The other thing is that she has a problem reaching top portion of the cage because she has nothing to grab on to,you may need to put a ladder or a rope no the side of the cage for smaller birds to get to the top. Other than that we really like the cage. Likes: easy to clean the bottom trays & grate without disturbing the bird. The both put out independently. Easy swivel out feeder is great cuz you don\u2019t have to stick your hand in the cage. I like the top of the cage where my bird can just hangout. I like the height of the cage. I like there are wheels so you can roll the cage to any part of the house. This is the same basic cage sold by dozens, if not hundreds, of random Chinese resellers everywhere. It's real cast iron, if a bit thin, and it works very well as a cage. I have no complaints, especially at the price. It looks like a knock-off of the Prevue models that typically are more than twice the price. Compared to the Prevue models, these versions tend to be mostly the same, bar a few slight changes in how the doors swing open, the finish/coating feels a bit thinner, and the front door locks are all universally kind of bad. You have to press on the front door to get the spring-loaded lock/latch to line up correctly with the hole, something that isn't nearly as chintzy as on the Prevue model. But, for less than half the price, it's basically the same thing. Assembly sucks a bit because QA and part fitment is not precise, but it's not terrible and you only have to do it once. Overall, just pick the reseller with the lowest price, since all these cages are going to be the same. Also, don't be surprised if regardless of who you buy it from, the top perch design is different or the color is a bit different. There doesn't seem to be any consistency at all. I love the look of the cage and more importantly, the birds love it too! I have 2 quaker parrots and my female absolutely adores the windy rope perch that came with it! It is her favorite spot! They also love getting out and roosting on the top play gym!! Very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing!! The only reason I give this cage 4 stars as opposed to 5 is due to the assembly!! What a nightmare of an assembly this was for me!! They give you a video here on the product page which is way too fast!! I had to keep restarting and pausing on things. The provided instruction pamphlet needs improvement as well!! Beware when you are assembling the front panel and the back panel that you don't have them upside down! This caused me to have to disassemble and reassemble so be very careful with this!! (also little black plastic end caps that are solely there for shipping need to come off before assembly as well!! Maybe this is obvious to most and I felt dumb when I realized my error but thought I should let you know just in case) If you are wondering whether or not to get this cage I would say go for it as the price and finished product is great!! That assembly though!!! uuugggghhh!! One final note the 4-panel apron that comes with it I decided to not use as I have had one similar to this one in the past and it doesn't do too much. This cage will fit in a  corner much better without  it! This is an incredible well manufactured cage for my two cockatiels.  I absolutely love it. ", "This is the third purchase I've made of this particular cage, in as many years.  Every one I receive has minor changes in the design over the previous one, and each time those changes are more detrimental to the overall design and parrot safety. There were a couple of good things about this cage. First, I needed a cage quickly, because a cage I inherited was deteriorated and unsafe. This cage arrived on my doorstep two days after I ordered it. Second, it was fairly easy to assemble. The instructions are minimal, but the assembly isn't difficult to figure out. It's not a great cage, though. First, it came out of the box with a \"ding\" on one outside corner that is already rusted (see photo 1). That doesn't bode well for this cage holding up very long. Second, the side bars are very flimsy. I'm neither young nor strong, and I'm sure I could snap them just by squeezing (see photo 2). With such flimsy bars, the cage isn't appropriate for any bird larger or stronger than a cockatiel. Even with a fairly small bird, the side bars actually \"twang\" when she moves around in the cage. Third, the dishes are not well designed, being too deep for the diameter of the dishes. It will be wasteful to fill them up with food, as a smaller bird can't eat that much, but most birds aren't going to want to reach almost four inches deep into a narrow dish to reach pieces of food. The dishes should either have a bigger diameter or they should be more shallow. All in all, unless you need something cheap, fast, and temporary I wouldn't order this cage. This is a great bird cage! It is larger than I expected even though I looked at the measurements. It was a little time consuming to put together. I really like how sturdy it is and the lock on the door. Most cages have wires going around the lower area where the food falls but this one does not. I did add a mesh bird cage skirt and it helps keep food and feathers contained. The play area is nice on top because I keep treats up there and have extra food for when she is out. I have a Turquoise Green Cheek Conure in it and she loves it!!! I assembled the cage this morning took about an hour and a half. Would have got it done sooner if i had not messed up the orientation of the left and right side bases. It is important to find the shelving on the left and right base to anchor your  bottom drawer to. Instructions weren't clear so it took some trial and error.  Once the parts came together it became easier. The play area on top was confusing, all i had to do was look at the product picture on amazon to get a better idea. Nice cage, seems sturdy enouigh and escape proof except for the food doors. The latch does not seem big enough, and looks easy for a bird to just take its beak or claws and pull the pin up to unlatch the food doors (not the main door). I will put zip tie around them for security. Good price, i cant wait to get my bird and see what he thinks :p I was happy surprised...I bought the 61\" and I thought it would be to big for my place (because I live in apartment. But actually this bird cage is good size for my Cockatiel not Cackatoo type. If you have Cackatoo, you will get the 68\". My 11 years boy with the help of friend can figured it out to installed it. There was one tricky part on how to place the food and drink containers inside the cage, you have to place the container when you open the door and put the containers from outside. I couldn't find this type of cage with this size at local good bird stores. I gave 4 stars because the messy food protection had bent on outside 2 corners, one you can tell and one small one, it didn't effect on the protection function. So, I don't mind and I will not return it just because of that. I'm satisfied with the cage. Great Bird Cage. Pretty much as pictured. It takes about an hour to put together if you do it by yourself. Some pieces had areas that were slightly bent/warped probably from poor handling at warehouse or during delivery but nothing too bad. I wish the wheels had a locking mechanism for them. They don't and I worried the cage would move if my dog bumped it even if only a light bump, potentially hurting my bird. I just kept the wheels off and saved them for later. It will make moving the cage harder but I can deal with that for now. Picture of cage provided with toys but without bird. The worst part is seen on the top where the perch is slanted. Other areas of warping or bending are in inserts. I bought this cage for my African  Grey. The cage was very easy to assemble and the bird welcomed her new home. For the price, this is an amazing cage. Somr parts came bent, including the legs for the cage, but that's USP's fault. The metal could have been a bit more sturdy. This cage is good for parakeets too, as long as none of the bars are bent and kept straight. A young budgie could squeeze through if the bars are bent from a toy or something. So be careful. I didn't realize just how big the cage would be. But I'm happy with it anyway. The edges on the top of the cage are rather rough and could be sanded a bit to prevent further unsolicited scratches. I saw a cage the same size at a bird store being sold for over $750! So this is a good alternative for sure. Flimsy and cheap.  Poor quality.  Many of the cage bars were bent, but then again they bend easily because they're so thin!  The quality is very low.  This cage may be good for a small cockatiel or dove, but not for any parrot specie!  My African Gray would probably bend the bars and get out easily.  It's definitely a case of you get what you pay for.  I will be returning it. I bought this same cage 3 years ago and decided to buy another one because my cockatiels love it. Packaging on first one was amazing and not one thing wrong with it.. Upon opening this one this morning to set it up the packaging alone for this is what I feel the reasoning on why this happened. It was delivered to me by a packed uhaul everything thrown in it because of the riots.. If I were to try to bend the legs back it would break the weld. They are very different when put together!  Bars on numerous pieces were bent and the piece towards the bottom that wraps around the cage that\u2019s like a seed catcher is totally crushed..  No fixing that either. The trays itself are bent also!  I am disappointed that I paid $50 more for the same cage I bought 3 years ago.. and to get it in these conditions! ", "#1 The food bowls are hugged by a piece of metal that loops around and inserts into two holes, as shown in the first photo. The cups are deep and the pegs that you insert are NOT LONG ENOUGH. In my second photo you can see that the bowl knocks into three bars! The bowls do not enter the food door because they are too low and when you remove them they drop to the floor of the cage and your food and water spill all over. That is inexcusable as for quality control. Our pair of cockatiels seriously needed a cage upgrade. We looked for a long time for cages online as large cages are just not sold at any retailers near us. We finally settled on this one as it had all the features we were looking for, as well as two sides with horizontal bars so the birds can climb around. We got it put together in about 20 minutes, it took both me and my husband as the pieces are quite large, but it was not bad to put together at all. And our birds love it. I also like that the spacing between the bars is not large enough for the birds to fit their head through, and the door to the cage has a very secure lock. Really great cage for the price. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure and he and I absolutely love it! The guards on the sides are a life saver and it really is super cute and spacious for a bird his size. If you have a larger parrot however I would really look at the inside measurements to make sure your bird fits comfortably with room to spread out since there is a lot of unusable space for your bird at the bottom. The guards were a little bent when we received the package but we could easily shape it back.  My green cheek really has PLENTY of room but he\u2019s also a smaller bird. I\u2019m not sure how to upload photos but if you have a conure I think they\u2019ll love this cage. It was very easy for my boyfriend and I had to put together and if you\u2019re unsure you can just look up the video on YouTube, it shows you step by step. Overall recommend. The instructions for assembling this bird cage were a little difficult to understand. I ended up getting the bird cup holder walls upside down. I wasn't about to take it apart and fix it. My African grey quickly figured out how to open the bird cup holders and got out. I have fixed this with little bird toy screw holders and she can't unscrew them. Other than that she really loves her new cage and it is much nicer with the perch on top. Love this cage! My son and I assembled it in about 45 minutes. I added some extra perches for my bird and it\u2019s perfect. I roll it from room to room as she likes to be able to see me. Easy to clean and I love the stainless steel dishes. Side doors to replace food and water, very easy. As other reviewers have mentioned, the included instructions are pretty trash and the diagrams don't quite match the actual pieces. But overall, assembly wasn't too bad. If you can put together legos, you can put together this cage. You will need a hammer or rubber mallet to push the wheels in. I purchased two of the 68\" cages for my green cheek conures and tiels. Likes: I love the quality. My tiel can fly inside her cage. My Conure jumped right in... no fear. It's the home(s) they needed/deserved. It's strong. Sturdy. Easy to assemble--Providing there are (2) people on some parts. Good price. Plenty of room. This cage is study and pretty. It gives my cockatiel and my parakeet a lot more room than my old cage.. The instructions could be a little more detailed but I figured it out. I am glad I bought it. Works great for my parakeet and cockatiel! The cage is good, the wings on the bottom could be more secured to the cage itself (they basically rest on the edge of the bottom, but are screwed to each other), and the wood perches could be a bit smaller, but otherwise it's good. Decent cage for the price.  The instructions are a little vague.  The contents list states 23 screws.  You would assume that they would all be the same length, but they are not, adding confusion as to which screws go where.  To help future buyers with assembly, you will use the shortest screws to mount the side shield pieces together and one screw to mount the ladder to the perch.  The next shortest screws are used to mount the brackets of the top perch to the cage.  All these previously mentioned will require the nuts the come inside.  Finally the longest of the screws will mount the front and back of cage to the its sides and also mount the top perch to it's respective brackets.  I would suggest getting either a small adjustable wrench or the correct size hex driver/socket wrench to help tighten the nuts and screws together.  Overall I am satisfied.  Time will tell when I have to clean it how easy that will be. ", "Extremely displeased... the box and the product were damaged on arrival after the delivery was delayed twice.  The front leg of the door panel were completely bent and broken as well as a few of the other panels and the bars of the cage.  The packaging is very poor and should be doubled up in key areas to protect the product (i.e. the corners and along the edges).  The materials that the cage are made from are cheap aluminum tubing with a \"wrought iron\" paint job.  The delivered product does not match the photos as the door that I was given had a brushed brass latching mechanism on it and the photos depict a polished aluminum/stainless steel latching mechanism.  If you value your money, look elsewhere for a bird cage. This bird cage was easy to put together, and even though we were missing one piece that went to a wheel, I e-mailed the company and was helped with the issue immediately and very professionally. We had the missing piece sent our way within two days! Excellent product and outstanding customer service! We love this bird cage, and so does our Green Cheeked Conure. The cage came a day early and it wasn't very hard to put together. A couple of pieces was trial and error.  The only thing I don't like about it I wish the ladder on the top perch was a little more stable it tends to move around a little bit.  It would also be nice if they put a small shelf at the bottom to put things. I was surprised with the quality of the wheels they are sturdy and roll just fine on carpet or hard wood floors. Overall I am happy with the cage and I believe my birds are as well. Beautiful cage! Fast shipping! Perfect for medium to small birds. Currently have one Budgie but planning to add more. People have said the bar spacing is too big for a budgie because it is .6 inches instead of the recommended .5 but my bird has had no problem. I love the design and functionality. The seed skirt really helps with the mess. The instructions left much to be desired for those that rely heavily on them. If you can look at how to put it together with a little common sense you will have no problem. I have seen individuals complain about the design of the food dish doors and that they don\u2019t function properly but that is only because they installed the side panels upside down. Everything functions just as described. My cage arrived with next to no damage whatsoever but it seems that I was one of the lucky ones. They definitely could add some more foam packaging around the outside of the cage in order to protect from being bent or scratched. it does not have as heavy gauge of steel as the more expensive cages out there but it also does not come with the high price tag. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this cage to those looking for a spacious cage for medium to small birds. Thank you yaheetech! I\u2019ve had this cage for about two years now, and it works well enough for its intended purpose(housing my two cockatiels), but it definitely could be better. My first issue was the cage I received was similar to the one advertised, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the same cage (lock was different, which the lock was a major thing for me bc my nephew loves to press buttons and he can get this open no problem). Not to mention that some of the review pictures show different cages from mine. The bars are easily bent, especially when having to set this thing up which took longer than expected. Within the first two weeks, we were having to constantly screw back in the bolts that kept falling off of the play stand and the seed catch (not bc of our birds, just from moving the cage over time) so we eventually just ziptied them in place bc the screws weren\u2019t staying. And the seed catch is just sad; the bowls are too high to actually catch anything thrown out so we just took those out and put lower ones in. And to clean the catch thoroughly or take the cage to a diff room, the catch borderline has to be taken apart, and ours are zip tied so it makes it really difficult to take on and off.  Overall, not a bad starter cage, but definitely not built for long term. I would say save you the time and effort and just buy a nice cage. This is poorly designed. The doors where the food bowls go just open, the latch on them does absolutely nothing. I had to secure them with something else. Also the food bowls don't sit right. I have to tilt them just to get them to fit with the door closed. The material feels cheap as well. I imagine this will rust rather quickly. Despite the many complaints regarding this cage.... I love it.... was easy to assemble.... very sturdy and is plenty of room for my Congo African Grey... especially with the play top~!  I have had MaCaws, Cockatoos and my Grey.... as well as cockatiels and budgies.  Yes the larger birds need more space but Greys do fine in this size ~!!!!  I am very pleased~!! I was very happy it arrived on time. My grandaughter helped me assemble and it took less than an hour.  I was a little dissappointed it was a little different than stated.  The bars were wider apart by a bit, I had measured old cage an .06 was size this is larger. Luckily I have 2 budgies/parakeets that are a bit plump so it works well.  The feeding cups and perches were humongous but I replace perches with lilac twigs anyway, they don't harm birds and work better for their feet.  They have plenty of room.  The box states parrot but the title included budgies.  One of the top rails was drilled wrong so I cannot utilize the top playground at all which is one reason I purchased it.  I have contacted the company and am hoping for a replacement to that rail, otherwise it will have to be re-drilled.  Over all birds love it. Next time I would probably purchase smaller space between bars just for an extra measure of safety.  Quality great for money and if your handy not that hard to assemble. Instructions don't exist though we went to web for help. Cage arrived fast. Well packed it went together easy, about 45 minutes. Very strong well constructed. Only problems are the color, says black more like a dark metal gray. The other problem is the size, bit of a shock on how much small it was then what we expected not sure if we miss read it or what but it\u2019s smaller then we had hoped. But our Indian Ring neck only uses the cage at night and is out all day so we are going to live with it for now. The cage itself is of fair quality, it is definitely a notch below some other more expensive ones, but is a good value. The cage comes in a flat box and you have to assemble it.  The instructions are really quite poor, with just drawings and no text.  There are several parts which need to be put on in a particular order, or orientation, but you just have to figure it out.  We had to disassemble part of the cage a couple of times to reorient parts which we got wrong on the first try.  Not a big deal, but better instructions would make assembly easier. ", "We liked this cage enough to buy a second one to expand Charlie\u2019s area.  We did raise the bottom pan to just under the wire base because we don\u2019t use the wire base unless we are cleaning the cage so the open space as it was intended was to big for us with cats and dogs in the house. My Conure loves this cage it\u2019s huge, he loves it so much he spends most his time inside. It arrived sooner than promised was a bit heavy but that\u2019s was expected. It took me no time at all to assemble the instructions were good enough to understand. The packaging was very basic as heavy as it is I\u2019m surprised there was minimal damage to the legs. The seed catcher works wonders. The two perches that were included had a weird fit but I purchased many more of different textures and sizes anyway. The feeding cups are huge my bird has decided one is a jacuzzi (lol). Overall, this cage is totally worth it and the price is an awesome deal!! Awesome cage at an awesome price! Bought this cage for my daughters parakeets. It was super easy to put together - my daughter & I had it put together in about 1.5 hours. The directions were ok, didn\u2019t realize there was an instructional video until uploaded in the advertisement photo gallery until after we put the cage together, but we did just fine without it. I purchased this cage well in advance of getting my cockateil so everything was ready to go when the little one got home. Yaheetech bird cage came exactly as it appeared in the ad and the videos on how to assemble.  All parts were there and it took me about 45 minutes to assemble - going slowly and reviewing each step photo to insure I had it right. The parts all fit together perfectly with the hole always forcing to to reorient any side piece you're putting in upside down.  The cage is large.  We left it for 2ndays next our always suspicious conure, who, after 12 years, still thinks we are trying to sneak in deadly artifacts into her original cage.  She was fine and happily moved in to her new spacious quarters.  We added our doggie pad to the bottom tray and clean up is easy every day, plus our walls and floors are now safe from droppings. Rate this 12/10 w 2 extra stars for easy clean up after 12 years of the hard way.  Worth. The. Money.  Looks pretty, too. This cage is really nice for the price. It was a little time consuming to put together & the directions could have been a bit better. But, overall, it's well worth it. Only issue we run into is the top play area. Not really built for a cockatiel or small bird.  Rods are too think & ladder is too thin & spaced too far apart. Food & water are awkward for our cockatiel to get to on top as well.  Still a great value & we just improvised. I bought this cage about 2 years ago for my sun conure, and I was pleasantly surprised with the cage's high quality. The metal was sturdy and didn't rust, the cage was huge (which I loved), but the bars were close enough together so that medium sized parrots such as mine would not be able to get their heads stuck between the bars. Also, the price is unbeatable. Today, this cage is still as good as it was the first day I set it up. Two years ago, I would have given this cage a 6/5. Last month I bought the same exact cage for my boyfriend's apartment because I needed someone to take care of my conure whenever I leave town. To my surprise, the quality of the cage has greatly reduced! The bars on the cage are significantly thinner, which is frustrating because they bend when your bird is sitting on a perch attached to them. The wooden perch that came with the cage was chipped at the edge, so I had to place the perch tightly in order for it to not fall down. There are a few small areas of rusted metal throughout the cage, and the door latch is slightly defective (you have to jiggle it to get the latch to open/close). It's as if the company reduced the quality of the cage just enough, thinking consumers wouldn't notice. Well, I noticed. The only reason I haven't returned it is because taking it down would be a hassle, and it's only a temporary home for my bird. This cage is priced very good and you get what you pay for. If you want to buy this cage for the first time do not put a bird in here that is very destructive because he will probably break the bars. The cage is pretty cheaply put together but not more than I expected for $140. I don't like the deep dishes but that is my opinion. Would I buy this cage again? I might. I babysit birds and I needed more cages and so this will work for me For the price I am satisfied. I bought 2, 1 for African Brown Head, the other African Red Belly. They seem to be fine with them. The Brown Head appreciates the play top as do I  - less mess around cage. Super easy to put together, no tools required other than the Allen wrench that came with it. Took 30 minutes are less going slow without even looking at directions. I'm sure I could put this cage together in 15 minutes if I needed to. The black color is nice. Cage isn't the strongest most heavy duty, but for 100 dollars its just fine. My little parrots wont ever destroy it. This cage overall is well worth the money. The 24 inch size is perfect for a medium sized parrot like a Conure or Senegal. I put it together by myself and it took about 45 minutes. If putting it together alone you will need something to lean parts up against while assembling. I had to use a hammer to get the wheels in, but once they were in they were very secure. ", "Thank you for this well made and affordable bird cage. When my wife had shared that our recently rescued  Quacker was in need of a new cage, I thought for sure we were going to break the bank account. Fortunately, my wife found this cage. We priced cages in our local pet stores and they were triple the cost, for the same quality! I like it cheap for the price but it looks like it's built nice. Came perfect no dents however one perch was broken at one end and had a 5 inch crack along it so I trashed it, I am noticing that for a cockatiel the perch may be to thick as he's fallen from it a couple times not sure yet on that. If it happens I'll probably throw it out too. I didn't like the stainless cups. They are a bit to deep my cockatiel has to go in the cup and feed sitting on his food I didn't like that I did see the prevue has slightly shallower cups which I'd probably have to just buy and replace. Which Adds to the total cost of cage. Obvisouly I could fill to the top but I like to have fresh food and refill every two days. The instructions were fairly good I did have an extra bolt since I set them around me and counted before I started I also saw the sizes and quantities were actually switched so that was confusing since they are 3 diff size bolts. I managed to build it by myself so that was good. One more thing I'd add is the lock fairly loud when you click to unlock it but a finger on the back stops the noise, the prevue cage has a 2nd lock on top of the door like the one this cage uses for the bottom grate which I think could be useful if added, in case the main lock breaks in the future. Overall I'd give this cage a 3.5 - 4 stars however the price and quality of the CAGE itself was great. Lets just see how long it last. I had thought this was the same cage that I had bought over a year ago for my sun.  I bought this cage for a greencheek.  many bars were bent and I was able to kind of bend them back.  One bar was broken and we will have to fix that because we are not able to return it.  to get the top on I had to use a hammer to straighten one of the bars back because it was so bent the top part would slide in. The wheels wouldn't go all the way in and I had  to use a hammer for that as well.  The bowls are hard to get out of the holders and will most likely be spilling food and water everywhere everyday. We ordered this cage with prime and it even came a day early! No pieces were bent, scratched, or sharp on the welded parts as some reviews had reported. This cage is a great quality cage. It definitely is a bargain compared to buying at the whole sale bird companies the same cage was over $400. A big difference between the two is this one has better wheels than the more expensive cage. Also putting it together was a breeze! A very sturdy cage that works great for my cockatiel! The cage is very large and provides plenty of space for him, but I couldn\u2019t imaging anything larger than a conure being comforable in this cage. The food/water bowls are very easy to clean and the poop trays slide out easily. The floor of the cage itself is even a foot or so above the tray so you don\u2019t have to worry about your parrot being exposed to its waste. Slight damage from shipping made assembly a bit of a hassle though, and one of the wheels is slightly dented so it wobbles a little bit when I go to open the door. But overall I would definitely recommend it for any small to medium parrot! The cage itself is really sturdy it came fully intact in good condition it was easy to put together as a matter of fact my thirteen-year-old did it with no problem the cage was bigger than I thought it would stand to be which made me even more happier I have a 8 week old Sun conure he really seems to like this caged a lot. For the price you can't beat it I saw the same cage in a local bird store that was asking $300 for I would definitely purchase from this seller again Looks very sturdy, very well done. Haven\u2019t had my cockatiel in there yet. But I assembled it last night. And The only reason I gave a 4 star is because the ladder on top of the cage doesn\u2019t fit and because the instructions on the box is absolutely horrible. This is a very well made cage. I love the sturdiness of the bars/door/etc, but I have a few qualms with it. It lacks food bowl windows, so the bowls have to stay in one place. No ability to move them, so my bird just keeps pooping in his water! So annoying. I also thought the cage-top perch would make the deal for me, but I actually don\u2019t like it that much. The tray at the top of the cage to collect poop from the perch makes it dark in the cage. I also don\u2019t like the perch & bowl size since my cockatiel struggles to get around. And it\u2019s really not that roomy. Lots of pros and lots of cons, but I\u2019ll be replacing this cage with something else The instructions for assembling are just pictures. There is a step in the beginning while you are putting the base together that needs to be clearer on the orientation of the panels. There are stops in the connecting pieces and the slots with for the trays have to be oriented correctly or you cant insert the trays. It was a serious pain to go back and change them once I realized they were upside down. The pictures need to clearly show how the slots and tabs should line up so people won't run in this problem. I bought this cage for my Greater Sulfur Cockatoo but I will use it for my Amazon Orange Wing instead. ", "You got what you paid for is mostly true. When I started to looking for a large cage for a bird my daughter got, I noticed there are so many cages available at amazon for different price but very similar look and feature. First I ordered one like $20 cheaper than this and was disappointed because the product was damaged during the shipping, and because the quality was not that good, very cheaply made. Then I decided to return the cheaper one and order this one instead. Wow, what a difference! I could not be happier with my decision.  A littler bit more money, a much better product. I highly recommend it. We bought this cage for a Quaker parrot and it is a nice size. I LOVE the fact that the two trays are interchangeable and I can swap one for the other when cleaning.  It makes my morning cleaning very fast.  I also like the fact that I can feed & water our parrot without having to enter his cage space with my hands.  He is often territorial first thing in the morning so it's nice to be able to quietly care for him without \"ruffling his feathers\" before I leave for work.  We found the assembly video on Amazon very helpful for \"the details\" of the assembly since the printed directions are all pictures with no text.  Having the video to refer to made assembly easy when we had the parts all spread out. This is the perfect size for a conure, cockatiel, quaker, ringneck, that sort of sized parrot. Anything smaller (budgies, finches, etc) the cage spacing would not work out and it won't be safe. Anything larger (eclectus, grey, macaw, etc) cage might not be spacious enough. The cage is high quality and came a couple days early. It took me and my mom to put it together i cant imagine one person doing this alone, though you dont need any extra tools or anything everything comes with it. The bowls were too big and deep for the sized parrot this cage is best for. None of the pieces were bended or defective but that might just have been shipping/handling issues for the other people who say this. Overall my quaker really loves this cage and it fits many more perches and toys than my old cage, this will be my quakers cage for a long time because it's perfect for him, very happy! I bought this for my baby Quaker parrot, who has special needs. He loves his cage. It was super easy to put it together, it\u2019s very sturdy, and the play top makes it so much better. He sits and plays on the play top and loves it. The toy it came with is really nice too. My bird is missing toes and doesn\u2019t have full gripping function of his feet but you could never tell! He absolutely loves his cage! This is a great size cage for my senegal. It was easy to put together. This cage is big enough for a goffin cockatoo, a pair of cockatiels and even a severe macaw with additional play top. Our sun conure likes the cage, but after the first day I noticed the paint was coming off as he moved around the inside top of the cage. I found paint in his water bowl and paper that lined bottom. Each day there was more and more. I know the item description says the paint is non-toxic, but certainly getting this in his mouth/ingesting it is not healthy - not happy with this and concerned for our 17 year old little orange/yellow buddy named Zoe. During installation, had to use a hammer to knock the caster wheels in the bottom of the square frame tubing for installment. One of the square tubing legs broke completely off.  The frame metal is paper thin. I`m not exaggerating it either. I did not use excessive force either. Was going to box it up and send it back, but I decided to carefully weld it back on with low low heat. Which is very very hard to do (very difficult) considering how thin the metal is. I should have took a picture, but wasn`t thinking. All I can say is, this cage is far from heavy duty. They need to put more quality in the product. In all honesty, yeah, the cage has some size to it, but, after seeing how poor it`s metal is, I say it`s worth about $50-$55. Very vague and confusing instructions, doesn't tell you what screws to use or go into any specifics besides \"screw this to that\" and \"put this piece here.\" A lot of pieces were bent pretty badly. Took about 2 hours to put together, would have been MUCH quicker and less stressful if they had put more work into the instructions and if there weren't several pieces that had to be hammered back into a working shape. I\u2019m the kind of person who reads up on all the reviews before making a purchase, so hopefully if you\u2019re the same way you\u2019ll find this helpful. The cage is the perfect size for my cockatiel and could probably even comfortably house two. It was relatively easy to set up and the material is sturdy. The side guards were pretty bent up when I received the cage, but I opted not to use them anyway for cosmetic reasons so I didn\u2019t take off any stars. I\u2019m 5\u20194 and the cage stands over my head with the top attachment. Overall very happy that I decided to go with this cage and it is very much worth the price Based on other reviews I knew what I was getting into. This cage is more than large enough for my quaker Parrot. The instructions aren't great, so it does take extra time to assemble. Bars are sturdy enough BUT the quality compared to Prevue or HQ cages isn't there. My biggest gripe at this point is that I was short 2 bolts to build the play stand on top. Easily replaceable with a trip to Lowe's but a hassel that I'd rather not deal with. ", "I bought this cage for my cockateil. This cage is big enough for two or three cockateils.  I wanted a stand cage for sturdiness as I have a miniature schnauzer.  The cage came with minimal picture directions.  Daunting for me but my 21 yo son put it together with ease.  This cage is plenty sturdy for my cockateil.  It would NOT be strong enough for an African Gray.  My mom's Gray has a cage with bars twice as thick and she can almost bend them.  The door is easy to latch and close securely.  I love how the bottom grate can even pull put for easy cleaning!  The play top is great.  My cockateil immediately went up the ladder to perch, too cute.  I love the cage for my needs. It was a great price and the construction is for easy clean up with the pullout trays and grate. I would not put a bird larger than a conure in it though. Great size for my two breeding cockatiels. Plenty of space, the tin bowls are super deep, I am going to look for more shallow ones to replace the originals. Took me about 30 minutes to put together, I had to undo the top part twice because the instructions weren't as clear as far as which side was front or back. That's the only reason I gave it four stars and not five. Great quality, huge space, my birds love it. The \u00bfinstructions? on how to put this cage together  is severely lacking. All of us do not have access to instructional videos. I put this cage together on my own with a minor mistake. Pictures are worth a thousand words, but poor illustrations are crap. The cage is slightly off square and it evidently,  took a beating in the Fed Ex system. It is satisfactory and my Amazon seems to like it. Not 5 stars. Made in China! It was sturdy. Got the job done. A good cage for one single sugar glider. I put two in it, which was tight for them but doable if you take them out of the cage often enough. The way you clean it makes it easier and I like the way the door closes. It\u2019s a quality product that\u2019s a pain in the ass to assemble.  But it does look pretty freakin classy if you don\u2019t put up the winding toy. Cage came in and son decided to help me..... took over an hour and had to take apart and put back together a couple of times due to 15 ur old knowing how to do something.....instructions were  not good just watch video on Amazon instead. This is a lot smaller than the cage it is replacing but its sturdy. Just wish the legs were higher as it sets very low and only has 2 small doors for bowls really need 3. Oaver all good cage for the money I bought this cage for a 30 year old Amazon parrot that came into my life. He has grown to love his new home. It was fairly easy to put together and is well made. It is easy to move when sweeping and is easy to clean. It keeps most of the mess inside with the generous tray. A small downside was the perches provided were unevenly cut to size, one too big, one too small. I put the short one at an angle so it was still useable. I would highly recommend this cage. It is smaller than you think. I bought for Conure rescue that is a little escape artist, now she can't get out with the safety catch on the door. It is advertised for Too's but is way too small. Great for Tiels, Keets, Conures, Pionus and other small birds but nothing larger. It is worth the money. This cage has held up relatively well for about 18 months.  It dents easily, but they are easy to pound out.  It comes with 5 stainless steel bowls, but I cannot find more bowls that fit the diameter of the holders so I cannot get more (to switch out when washing). I couldn't use the wooden perches they came with because they were all cut to the wrong size.  However, these are all minor compared to my biggest complaint: rust.  It started around the wheels and a few exterior bolts.  I thought it would be okay since it was far away from where my bird could access.  However the rust has now spread to the trays.  The paint is wearing off with each subsequent wash.  I bought the cage because other cages this large were so expensive.  Save yourself the hassle and pop for the nicer quality cage that will actually last Great cage for my Green Cheek Conure. It has plenty of space for her. The instructions are okay but pay attention to how you assemble some panels. I had them upside and had to take them off and flip them. It\u2019s a great cage overall. Olive and I are very pleased with it. What a piece of junk. It\u2019s missing holes to bolt it together and some pieces came bent. I\u2019ve asked for  a return, but now realized they want me to pay return shipping. That is ridiculous for a defective cage. Due to my experience, I\u2019d avoid purchasing from this seller and especially it\u2019s cages . ", "Hey! Wife here- we have had this cage for 3 years. Our bird loves it. It is very well built and has wheels so you can move it around easy. There is 2 things that I don't care for- explaining the 4 stars - 1. It is really hard to deep clean - there is a catcher at the bottom that you cannot remove - while it is a valuable part to catch bird poop or food... you have to power wash it. 2. It is very hard to fit through a standard door. You have to take it apart. While everything in this world is not perfect - we value the integrity of this product and would recommend it! \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 Two stars for overall value, and that it's a good usable cage once you work the kinks out of it. Definitely some serious quality control issues from the manufacturer. Mine came completely unusable. The door latch was installed so crooked that the lock wouldn't slide into the latch hole. It was immediately obvious, which tells me the person putting these together doesn't care one bit about their job or you, the consumer. I had to re-drill all 4 holes into the steel door to position the lock correctly. One of the three food bowl doors is unusable because the slide lock is tack welded in the wrong place, making it impossible to unlatch. I haven't figured out a fix for it yet. Also, as others have stated there is a space on both sides of the cage between the seed guard and the cage, which makes seeds fall straight to the floor instead of the bottom pan. I was able to somewhat fix it by drilling more holes and putting in screws to bring the bottom of the guard in closer to the cage. If I had to do it again I would buy a different cage. Not recommended. i just ordered my third and fourth cage - 68\". Someone mentioned dont order if you have cats, well i have three and no problems, with adjustments. We put plastic acrylic cut to size around the bottom of the cage. I put  two together for my budgies ( and they love it!) . Main reason why put two together it will give them the length they need since budgies are not helocopter birds, and this cage is so easy to clean, i cant stress enough how easy it is. I have attached picture. Some of the instructions were a bit unclear but nothing you couldn't puzzle out.  I suggest you do not completely tighten everything down until you have it all together.  After you install the seed catcher around the bottom this thing will not fit through most standard doorways so make sure you have it in the room you want it before you assemble this part.  My cockatiels love it and I would recommend. It's great for the price. this same style cage costs triple this at my local pet store. A few pieces were a little bent but easily fixable. The instructions are awful. They send 4 different size screws and the instructions just say \"secure with screw\"... which size screw? It also doesn't show where the screws should go on the instructions. It's mostly guess work to set it up. I wish the bottom poop box was closer to the grate. I ordered this for my conure.  I am very impressed.  It is very large in size and plenty of room for her to move around.  It has the play area on top which she loves.  It comes with 5 stainless steel bowls that are so much better than the plastic ones.  The only issue is they are a little deep for my conure but would be great for larger birds.  The door has a spring loaded latch which is very nice and she can't open it.  It has the seed catcher which helps to keep some of the seeds in and off the floor.  Nice easy slide out drawer for easy clean.  Would recommend especially for the price. The Wheels on the cage are the room wheel whenever I go to push it they fall off. The purge that was sent does not fit or stay at any angle for the week my birds. I've had problems with hose not fitting. Also there are a knot of the longer screws to continue to put my cage together and I'm having a problem with putting the seed holder because the direction are not Pacific enough other than that I like my Birdcage and I do not want to return it but I do want the right Wheels this Cruise and the actual directions to setting up the bird holders they don't fit then longer sides are too long a measurement is off I understand people are human we make mistakes I just want them corrected thank you This is a great cage. Nice and sturdy. The playtop area pieces were bent and unusable so I contacted customer support and they sent me new pieces. Customer service was phenomenal. All in all this cage is amazing. I absolutely love it. I will be ordering more of the same in the future for my other birds. I got this cage for our Grey Parrot...Someone gave me a HUGE heavy duty cage that's just too big so I wanted to downsize and this cage worked out as far as size is concerned however the bars are thin and flimsy....This is why the cage is cheaply priced....It looks good and comes with nice deep stainless steel bowls but the bars are thin...This cage after assembled is also very light weight and moves easily because it is a light weight metal cage. It's definitely not sturdy it's a really flimsy some of the pieces don't fit right you got to work with them and bend some of the bars it sucks on size I can spend so much money on this cage and bird stuff I would buy I'd get a different cage and send this one back but I can't do that because my bird is in there nowI don't recommend this cage it's not any sturdier probably than the imitation ones it really does suck ", "MyTimneh African Grey really enjoys her new home. Just be careful when inserting the side panels. Facing the front door, the right side panel is the one that has ONE feeder cup. The left panel has TWO feeder cups. If the panels are reversed, a smart bird will open the feeder cup door and get out. Assembled properly, the slide handle will prevent the bird from sliding the latch open. Found this the hard way. This cage was delivered very damaged with bent bars and missing pieces. I read in the reviews that other people had this issue as well but I took the chance anyway. Company should package product better. The package was over a week late because it got lost somewhere an hour from my home. I kept the cage and went to my local hardware store to purchase the missing pieces. Also had to get the man of my house :) to get some tools and bend the pieces back into place so that I could properly assemble it.  If I wasn't in such great need for the cage,  I would have returned it. Once repaired and assembled, the cage is a good size and my Eclectus enjoys it...this is the only reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a 1 or 2. I like the way the cage looks and the play area up top is useful. Unfortunately there is no where to hook toys on the top. :( The product came faster than expected, but the packing was anything but protective. The box was stapled together in several spots and the cage inside was not protected at all. It is a nice cage, after I had to fix several bent rods. A few I couldn't fix because it looks like they would snap, so I added netting around the cage. Would be 5 stars if the product wasn't damaged from poor packaging. Way bigger than I expected, my birb loves her cage. This is an awesome cage that was very easy to assemble.  It does go a lot faster with two people so someone can hold it while the other one lines it up.  We left the seed catch tray off the side, it adds a lot of needed space to the cage dimensions.  The door closure is a good secure latch. I like how nice the finish is, how the parts fit nicely together, and it's so easy to move around. Our bird loves it. He had a bigger cage before but likes this one better. It stays a lot cleaner too. All around, I'm happy with this product and would recommend it highly. I\u2019m going to use this cage for the green cheek conure I\u2019m getting. It was not hard to assemble which is always great. The only that I don\u2019t like is the deep dishes that come with it I\u2019m not gonna use them. Nice looking cage, easy to clean out. It has wheels which is a plus. I would recommend this cage for a cockatiel or green cheek conure maybe even a little bit of a bigger bird. None of the pieces came bent for me, the side pieces do seem a little flimsy but I don\u2019t think that would be a problem for my birds. This cages bar spacing is to big for budgies and similarly sized birds. Overall I do really like this cage and I like the  sturdiness of it when it moves, its big but not too big. This is a great cage for the money!  It\u2019s very sturdy and easy to clean. I bought it for my spoiled green cheek conure. It\u2019s a huge cage for him and he loves it. The dishes were way too big for him and the bar spacing on the bottom of the cage was a little wide. I took the bottom wire out of my old cage and set it on the bottom of this one like someone else did who reviewed this same cage. I am using this cage for my quaker, and it works great for him.  Would recommend for any similar sized bird, probably not the best for an african grey or small cockatoo though.  Bars are fairly thin and side panels slide in place instead of being permanently attached to the framing.  Packaged well and arrived on the day amazon said it would.  Cannot beat the cage size, looks and quality at this price. Love this cage! It came 2 days earlier than expected and in excellent condition. No denta dings or bent pieces. Assembly wasnt aa bad aa I expected but the seed guard was a PAIN to attach. The missing bars don't look like they broke off.  There are no sharp edges.  My Alexandrine parrot could fit her whole head through these missing bars and get caught.  I'm returning it but, based on this experience alone, I will never purchase a Yaheetech cage again. ", "It took longer to get unpacked than it did to assemble.  Just sort and identify all the parts before you start.  It's a nice cage and is perfect for the two cockatiels I got for my birthday.  Having rounded corners on the seed gaurd is a nice touch as they are shin high.  Some folks on here thought the parts were bent and tried to straighten... don't do that.  It was so easy to build I could have had a monkey do it.  The instructions are fine IF you pay attention and follow them accurately. To small for African grey. contacted them . no answer.. Will not buy again .I am stuck with a cage I can not use . This bird cage was absolutely perfect. I, a female, was able to put it together all on my own with no difficulties. I love that it has wheels and I can easily wheel it out of the way to clean the floor around the cage. I also love the skirt, perch on top and the small doors in the side for food so the birds don't fly out. I am very happy with my purchase. Great product! This was pretty easy to assemble, but the side peices are very flimsy and you can\u2019t attach any toys or perch\u2019s to the sides because of that.  None of the other reviews really said that or I wouldn\u2019t have purchased.  It also had a few dents and some of the pieces were bent as well as being short a few nuts.  The shipping was super fast though and considering the price it\u2019s not a bad beginner cage. The product is ok and recommended for small to medium size birds, however I don\u2019t recommend this for African Grey ( this bird is very active and hyper unlike other medium size birds). The best thing I like is the customer service of the seller, they reply to my inquiry and resolved my minor concern. They are very professional and I wasn\u2019t expecting they are committed to customer satisfaction. The cage is easy to assemble just pay attention to drawings/instructions. You can also watch the video. ( make sure you put the base correctly for the tray-stopper. I put the stopper in front, need to redo that part). I had an issue with my package being lost and even though I was frustrated, the seller DID keep in touch with me and sent me another cage overnight. They were very nice and took care of the situation promptly. The cage was pretty easy to put together. My 9 year old helped me. It\u2019s sturdy and beautiful and overall we are very happy with the cage. Our bird is happy too! For the price it's awesome! This isn't a $1000 cage, the bars were bent, and the instructions suck. But for $140 it's great! Echo our Indian Ringneck LOVES it too. It seems to me like these are the damaged $500 cages you would usually buy, the bars are easy to put back straight, so it's all doable. Believe it or not this was a great find.  It looks cheap when it arrives but holds up really well and is a lot less than pet store retailers.  I would recommend but don't be put off with the lighter materials used.  The latches and other mechanisms work great and the wheels hold the weight of the cage and move with ease. We purchased this for our Cockatoo, and we like how the upper tray slides out to allow light in through the top, and the size of the cage. However, the bars of the cage are way thinner than we were expecting, so they flex when our bird climbs on them AND the perches we screw on to the sides of the cage wobble a little and aren't solid. I'm also hoping she doesn't chew through a bar or two. This is a nice cage and my bird likes it.  One perch came broken (very disappointing) and the food guard is a bit cheap and doesn't really prevent food from making it to the floor.  Overall the cage is nice.  Assembly was relatively easy and a few weeks later my bird seems more at peace and happy in his new home. ", "So I got this cage for my eclectus as his sleeping cage as this would not be big enough for him or an African grey (especially once u add a couple toys) as their main cage. My ekkies main cage is 36 x 28x57 and I sometimes think that is not big enough. The assembly video on here is not the same cage! It shows it as 4 cage walls when in actual it is 2, the front and back, and then the sides are actually flimsy inserts that slide in. Also the package looked like it been dropped and one of the welds on cage bars were broke but u pay for what u get an honestly it\u2019s worth the money but made more for conure, Senegal\u2019s, Pionus, and other smaller mid size birds Sturdy cage,easy assembly, arrived quickly, rolls easily but heavy enough not to be too prone to accidental bumps.good quality stainless steel bowls  and the cage finish is very attractive. Door closure has a security lock button that my parrot won't be able to reach to escape. Love it EXACTLY what was described and what I thought I ordered. Came on time other than a shipping delay but had nothing to do with the seller and everything to do with UPS. It was SO easy to assemble I barely looked at the directions. I love the new home for my conure he also seems to think it\u2019s just fantastic!! Thank you!! Will be ordering a second one for my other conure! TERRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION!! Watch the video for installation. The cage arrived bent. I got defected screws. Bars were bent all over. The top piece does not sit properly , I had to zip tie them. I gave it 4 starts because my birds do like it. Our Green Cheek conure breeder suggested this cage as they have had several clients happy with it. Great size,Came right on time, nice neutral hammered finish, play top is a great feature. This cage is a fraction of the price of comparison cages at the pet stores, actually same price as used ones on Craigslist! husband put it together effortlessly, One piece of the skirt was dented, but all in all very happy with our purchase ! Recommend This cage was just the right size for my cockatiel. It was fairly easy to follow instructions to put together, plus I knew a video tutorial was available that I didn't end up needed. My first cage was lost during shipping and the company quickly sent another. Very happy with this cage overall. I did have 2 bent bars as others have noted, but bent them back easily so they aren't noticible. One of the trey handles was stripped so could not attach to the trey. I have a Congo African Gray parrot and she fits really well in this cage, no problems. However the max amount of time she stays in this cage is 2 weeks. I definitely would get something larger as a more permanent home. I purchased this cage because of the added play top.  We started assembling this cage and realized it is way to small for our liking.  The current cage our sun conure is in is easily 3x bigger.  I looked at a lot of cages but apparently did not pay attention to the dimensions of this cage - this cage would be better for smaller birds like parakeets.  One other thing I didn't like was how low it sits to the ground - very weird.  Returning was easy but we were charged a re-stocking fee.  I still gave it two stars because it is the same material as our current cage so I'm sure it's easy to take care of and keep clean. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this. I was skeptical about how sturdy it would be when putting it together, but once all the bolts were tightened it was perfect. No dents, damage, or missing parts. Very easy to clean and perfect size for my conure. I do wish they had this size in white. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t pay hundreds for this same cage in the pet store. ", "The cage itself is very nice the only problem is that the little door holders where the food bowls go don\u2019t open and close properly. They\u2019re bent up so it is always a struggle to open and close without spilling water and food all over the place. This is plenty big enough for our Green Cheek Conure. Only issue was the door lock broke shortly after buying. Luckily she hasn't figured out how to escape. The little latch thing that hangs a bit over the top of the door keeps it from opening all the way. I would probably buy again, it is a nice cage. Our Conure is very comfortable with the size. You get what you pay for with this cage. Its cheap metal, and not high quality, but it's cheap so what could you expect. I thought the cage was safe, all the bars looked good, good doors, sturdy perches, etc. The bowls, once fit into the holders, did not fit through the little food bowl swing doors. But this isnt a huge factor, unless your bird is cage aggressive and you rely on those tiny food bowl doors to feed your bird. I used this as a vacation cage for like 3 weeks, and it was perfect! Overall, I was pleased I had to buy this cage because I moved recently and my big California cage wouldn't fit in my new place. I was very happy with how fast it got here since my bird was stuck in a preview cage for a few days. When I ordered it I was worried it wouldn't be big enough for my Double Yellow because most of the reviewers had smaller birds like Conures, but now that I have him in it, it's definitely enough space. The bars aren't as sturdy as his old cage but he's not very destructive in general so I'm not worried about it. Side note, yes the first step of instructions is misleading but once you think about it enough and get past step 2, it's smooth sailing from there! Our green cheek conure is so happy in this cage! it is the perfect size for him. It has two removable trays that make clean up super easy. The walls around the outside have been a time saver for cleaning too. No spills or food on the carpet. Love love love. One of my favorite purchases of all time I didn't have to wait that long to receive the cage, I was able to put it together by myself & my 2 cockatiels love it. This cage gives them so much more room even with their toys it is not too cluttered. I have yet to put up the play area on top of the cage due to a shortage of screws but besides that everything is awesome. Quality is just 'okay', good for the price.  I do not like the way the feed bowls swing out along with the door creating a huge space for the African Grey to 'walk out' while trying to remove bowls for re-filling.  Bad design.  Also, the doors are placed in areas preventing attachment of perches.  REAL BAD DESIGN there.  I find this to be extremely DUMB in the designing. I purchased this cage from a different vendor and it was awful - rungs not welded - missing pieces.  This is the very same cage - but not a wreck.  Mom loves it for her green cheeks conure - tiny parrot. Just a great product. No problem to assemble. Thought I was missing a cup holder. Contacted the company and they sent one right out. As it turns out it was attached to a screen and let them know immediately but they told me I have an extra. Great company and great product. I will always deal with them Looked like it was a previously purchased item and sold again!! Bent cage. Zip ties cut. Loose pieces in package. ", "Dont buy this cage. The picture shows a parrot next to it. The wires are NOT wrought iron and the spacing is only suitable for parakeets, lovebirds or cockatiels. My cage arrived with bent wires. Mr Harvey loves his new abode. I had no trouble putting it together by myself. 1.Throw the instructions away. They are useless. I sat on the floor and put mine together.  2. The cup hooks fit into the little slots on the feed doors. Took me a second to figure that one out. The cage is nice but the instructions are awful, I had to use the picture on Amazon. I love this cage so very much. Currently housing my quaker in it who is an escape artist. This is it! The solution. I leave and put him in his cage and when I return home, amazingly, he is still there! I have had birds all my life and this is the easiest cage to clean that I have ever owned. It is sturdy and looks like a quality buy when put together. I plan to buy another for my Indian Ringneck as well. Buy it, you won't regret it! Best cage I have purchased. I am so happy with this cage. The quality is great. Easy enough to assemble and my bird loves it. The play area on top is a nice addition! I would recommend this to anyone with a small to medium bird. I was very weary about buying a birdcage online for my conure. But this cage is great. I only gave it 4 stars because the directions for assembly were not explained fully. We did figure it out once we looked it over a bit. I would recommend for a smaller bird. This cage works perfectly for my green cheek.  It\u2019s extremely sturdy and has a nice finish to it. Easy to clean and maintain. Jack, our cockatiel, just loves his new \"condo\".  It's a quality product and delivery was very quick.  I especially like the fact that you can move it around to vacuum around it easily, plus it seems to be fun for him when I  move him in front of the window or out on the deck. Love this as my Indian Ringneck Loved it so quicky.He never adjusts well with new items.Its very nice cage and espc  for the money.It is better then my Preveu cage. Wrong dimensions, add shows 32 inch but it's only 24 inches. In the last month I've ordered 2 new cages and neither is large enough. Will not be ordering anything else from your company as you really do mislead us in the actual size of the cages I've bought. The seed guards should not be advertised and included in the actual cage size. Very very disappointed in both cages. I love this Yaheetech Pet Bird Cage! ", "We have our 2 budgies in this cage and they have plenty of room move! They especially love the perch on top of the cage. There was one cage piece that was slightly bent but it was easy to correct. The directions left a little to be desired but we had it assembled in about an hour. The trays make cleaning very easy. I'd buy it again! For the price this cage is well built. Removable floors and trays make cleanup easy. Recommend at least an hour for assembly. Cockatiel loves the cage but has a hard time getting from top play area to the cage, I put some climbing ropes hanging off the side to make it easier for him to get down. Included a lot for the price. This shipped pretty quick and I was really surprised. For 106$ you get the playground and the tray to catch waste on the top and bottom so it was well worth my money. It also saves up space instead of having to buy the ones at PetSmart or petco and they\u2019re also overpriced as well. I was happy overall however putting it together was tough because the pictures in the directions didn\u2019t look like the parts that came with the cage. This cage also comes with the stainless steel bowls compared to PetSmart\u2019s stainless steel bowls which are about 10$ each... and on the sides of the cage there\u2019s little doors that you can attach the bowls onto and open from the sides, it is very convenient!! I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. I love this cage! I have several cages for our birds and this one seems to be good quality. I read other reviews about the instructions & cheap quality etc. Ignore those reviews because they're not true. If you take your time and read the instructions carefully it goes together just fine. I myself rushed it and put the top on backwards. That was nobody's fault but my own. But I love this cage and my girlfriend's Quaker loves his new cage. I would definitely recommend this cage. Huge Box ... Huge Cage ... My bird, the kids, the wife love it.  At first I was a little upset, since what arrived was a little different that what was on the picture (Entrance Door).  But I can't complain.  Building it was a little frustrating, when I had to grab a pair of pliers to bend .. yes bend into position the metal. Was wondering, is this used? how did this bend? ...but. It has 5 Stars ... this is THE BEST CAGE, especially $$$. Bought for Amazon parrot.  NOT strong or sturdy, only of fair quality.  Especially compared to my old cage. Do not recommend for large birds such as Amazons. It will suffice but the metal is too thin and not easy or comfortable for my Amazon to climb around this cage. Bought this cage for our conure that is home alone all day and up late. It is perfect for him. He loves all the room to play. He uses the whole cage from top to bottom. We have a ton of toys clipped for him to enjoy. The reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is a couple of pieces had to be bent back to fit correctly and the directions could have been more clear. Great item for my bird. Nice cage with metal cups for easy cleaning. Really liked the easiness of assembling the cage. This cage replaced the bigger cage I had that wouldn't fit in my new house. Much easier to clean too. Great product overall. The metal skirt is a bit cumbersome if you\u2019re rolling the cage around a lot. I don\u2019t use it and just have a washable mat underneath to keep the floor clean. Great value for the money. Good size for cockatiels, conures, and love birds provided they get enough attention and play outside of their cage. ", "Description is inaccurate. The cage is not suitable for a cockatoo. I ordered the largest size and the top grate slides were bent. There's nothing holding the top on doesn't screw anywhere. The two side panels have bars exposed that a bird can easily grab , bend and escape. I have to return it. Would be ok for a smaller bird. This is an awesome cage fore the money. It's not super heavy duty, so I wouldn't recommend for larger birds that can bend, tweak, or break the wires. We have one for a Senegal Parrot and one for an Indian Ringneck Parrot. They have plenty of room. The quality is higher than expected for a cage at this price range. All of the parts were in the box. Everything fit together. One cage had a leg tube slightly bent during shipping, but was easily bent back. The seed guards are rounded nicely and fit together to make safe corners. It took approximately 45 minutes to assemble. I bought this cage a little less than a year ago and everything looked great, very sturdy and went together easily except for that the directions were so terrible. We were very happy with our purchse and decided to buy a matching one for our newest bird. When I got it, it was completely different than my first. The wheels are different, the latch is copper not silver or even looks the same as in the picture, the bowls are different, the trays have handles, its over all darker in color, cage is 2 inches taller than the other one and the spot where the 3rd bowl is located is different as well. ALSO, they shorted us 3 screws and nuts. So its safe to say that we are very unhappy with it. If you are buying this for non matching reasons, it is great! Sturdy build and not too hard to put together. Just shorted screws in our order. I bought this for my 26 year old African grey. It went together easily, there were many screws left over, and a small screwdriver even came with it. No other tools needed. My bird loves it. I found no bent pieces, no sharp edges, and am very pleased with the value for the money. The doors for the food and water do not stay closed. They open very easily and our little one has escaped a couple times because of this. We also have dogs so this is dangerous. A little hard to put together especially if you don't have a second set of hands to help. Looks nice. This was exactly what I expected for my daughters parakeets. Good quality; very spacious for two parakeets; and easy to clean. Worth the money!!!! I purchased this cage for my indian ringneck. It's very large and I can fit a bunch of toys in there for him--my experience with the packaging of everything was perfect, except I seemed to have a few extra random screws (I definitely used all that I could). It shipped extremely quickly, arriving within three business days. I love the tray at the bottom to catch seeds and the play area on top is perfect! We needed a new cage that wouldn't mess allow the floor around it to get so messy. This one came packaged well and was mostly easy to assemble...the instructions are a little hard to decipher at first but once you get going they all make sense. Love this bird cage and so easy to put together my 14 yes old daughter did it herself. There is lots of room for our feathered friend and he loves to come out and in at will. I was not disappointed at all with this product and it keeps the floor clear which I love. Don\u2019t waste your money on this cage. It was falling apart as I put together. Poor quality, the wires were bent and broke when assembling the wood was cracked on the edges, the catcher practically comes off with the slightest touch and it was way smaller than it looked and thought. Definitely regret buying. ", "Great quality, especially for the price.  I'm using this cage for a cockatiel--I wouldn't suggest this particular model for a bird any larger though.  My grandson assembled it and didn't seem to have any problems.  It's very easy to clean, I've just used a little vinegar & water to wipe clean.  Overall I'd say it was a good buy. None My Green Cheek Conure is absolutely tiny in this cage; but that's great! Nice size for my African Grey. Instructions are difficult to understand as the picture step by step was way to small for viewing which screw to use. One side of of cage had  feeding door up side down. No, I didn't put it on wrong. Would not advise this cage for stronger, big beaked birds as the cage walls are very flimsy. We bought this cage because we currently own 3 indian ringnecks and 1 jenday conure so it would be big enough for all to fit. As soon as we started to unwrap the pieces, two of the major parts were bent already. Instructions sucked. At the end when we were ready to assemble the play top of the cage, we noticed that we were not sent enough screws and nuts to finish the job. How are you going to send a product that is only going to end up half done because you didn\u2019t want to send all the screws and nuts? Birds are liking the cage, only reason it got 2 stars. Have to say I was nervous ordering this cage without seeing it. But with our baby cockatiel ready in the next two weeks we took the chance. So glad we did! It was in perfect condition when it arrived. All parts were there and it was pretty easy to put together! Just follow the directions they include.  Overall good quality - arrived on time and easy to put together! Love it very sturdy the latch is perfect not so easy for my parrot to open anymore. Super easy to clean and very easy to move around with the wheels on the bottom overall very happy thank u! Took awhile to put this product together. Some damage had occurred on shipping but was able to fix it with pliers, etc. It's fairly easy to clean and it's mobile, so it's easier to sweep or vacuum behind the cage. Considerably sturdy. i reluctantly purchased this cage but when it came i couldn't have been happier.  it's an excellent size cage for a conure or pionus parrot.  it was easy to assemble and did it in less than 30 minutes.  keeps the seed mostly off the floor with the cage guard.  love it! This is a really nice setup if you want something sturdy but not so $$$ I thought it was very easy to put together about 20 mins from start to finish didn\u2019t run into any issues ", "Good sturdy cage.  The price was very good.  Delivered to my home in an heavy flat box.  As usual the instructions was hard to understand.  Put it  together and no missing parts. I think my conures like it much better than their previous cage. I keep several of my parakeets in here and honestly I have never had a better cage for them. The simplicity of cleaning the cage and the doors for their food and water are wonderful! There is plenty of space for not only them, but their many perches and toys. The spacing on the bars is also perfect for their little feet. The cage is also very versatile for many different breeds. While my little budgies live there comfortably, so could my African Grey. Piece of junk The cage was going together beautifully, despite the vague directions, until it came time to place the top stand(play top) into the stand. The thick metal was so badly bent that my husband had to hammer it straight, there was no way I could manipulate it myself. It was fairly simply to assemble, the instructions were very basic but understandable. I originally bought it for my new alexandrine parakeet but it\u2019s smaller then I imagined so I will definitely have to upgrade to something a bit bigger. The only issue I has was that the seed guard rails? Do t know if that what they are called but they were bent luckily they are not thick so I could use pliers to bend them back and they turned out pretty good if I say so myself \ud83d\ude1d I was really disappointed with this cage. I expected it to be nicer and more sturdy. It's basically a travel size cage. Not very wide and the bars are too wimpy to put a perch on it that will hold a parrot. I would not recommend if it is the main cage, too small for a parrot. Our family loves this cage for out parrotlet!  Plenty of room, the bars are stable and strong, shipping was on time, easy drawers do not get stuck as I thought they would.  Very easy to clean!  So happy about getting this cage!! The spacing was a bit larger than .6 inches as noted. Also a couple of bars were bent and one bar actually had almost a one inch space. Fortunately it was only one and I was able to bend the bars a bit to correct this. Otherwise I like the cage and so does my little guy! This is his vacation cage at his babysitters and he seemed to love it. Basic instructions, but easy to assemble. Ladder and top play structure could have sturdier rungs and a wood perch... I'm adding those myself. For the cost, I'm extremely pleased.  Used with African Grey Really decent product for the price. Constructions were slightly confusing but looking at the finished product on the package helped. My only real complaint is that the seed catchers attached to the side aren't quite wide and or tall enough to catch the majority of seeds. My bird does enjoy sitting on top though. ", "I filled this with all her toys!  Sometimes I can't find her in it!  It is well made and was not hard to put together.  Looks really nice in my living room.  I leave the door open for her to get out  now and then but she loves it so much she flies right back in. I purchased this cage in preparation for getting a Conure and it came in damaged. However after a few emails to the company they agreed to replace the product. We received the new one fairly quickly and was not damaged this time. It\u2019s well worth the money. Love it all the way around. I love this cage!  It was very easy to assemble, regardless of the minor bending that I had to do.  I did it on my own, so it took about 45 minutes.  Two people would make quick work of it.  All of the parts were in the package.  I feel that it is a very sturdy cage, based on the fact that my birds are cockatiels.  It could handle up to a medium sized conure, easily. Easy to put water and food, Very light and easley moves when trying to open door, I really like this bird cage, delivery was super fast.assembly was a breeze. It took me about 40 mins to put together. Very nice design. The cage did come with missing accessories but customer service were very responsive and shipped the missing items immediately. Although i still have not received it, i still feel comfortable giving them 5 stars because i received good quality,easy assembly and great customer service. I will be purchasing a few more as I add a few feathered friends to my flock. MY COCKATIELS LOVE THEIR NEW HOME, I WOUD GIVE 10 STARS. EVEN I, A SENIOR (66) HAD NO PROBLEMS PUTTING TOGETHER THIS GEM. ALL PARTS WERE THERE AND I WAS AMAZED THAT I ACTUALLY PUT IT TOGETHER WITH NO SWEAT. I first thought it was too lightweight but now I love it. It appears they have actually assembled parts but the instructions don\u2019t reflect this.  It really is simple to assemble. Use a rubber mallet to put the wheels on.  The cage is wonderful This is a very sturdy cage and don\u2019t let the price fool you. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this cage. It is comparable to the more expensive one. They have a good customer service, send me missing parts promptly. Purchase at your own risk. More good reviews than bad and that's why I bought this.  The cage came bent missing screws bad instructions(had to figure out on my own) and cheap perches that have splits. The seller  is VERY difficult to get a refund from. I was a bit surprised how flemsey it was. The directions are very lame. Couldn\u2019t expect more from China. After I got it together it looked nice. Just waiting to see if my African Grey will destroy it. ", "We got this for two parakeets. So far they love it. It was easy to put together and the trays that slide out for cleaning make it easy. It looks fantastic too. Had no guard around the bird dropping so if bird is on the cage , he Can climb right into his dropping area Our Parrot loves it and she climbs all over it to the top. My 12yr old and I put it together with minimum issue. Little hard on the top cuz I'm 5'4 and it requires a little muscle but my daughter is 5'7 and did the tall stuff. Received quickly, however, odd differences in the finishing of the main door latch, doesn't match the rest of the cage but the bird doesn't mind. No instructions so my son assembled some pieces backwards. Again the bird doesn't mind. I assume that these little problems balanced the fact that this was the least expensive cage I found on Amazon.com,, there are many vendors with this exact  product for more money. Went together nicely! With half an ounce of DIY knowledge this is an easy build. Looks and performs like a 300 plus cage. It is perfect for my conure. I bought another for my cockatiel, because I liked it so much. For the money this is a no brainer! Tried and true, this cage has worked for two of my three parakeets. My more unintertained budgie found a way to squeeze through the rack that separates the dropping tray from the rest of the cage, but my pair has been fine and shown no interest in doing such. It is a very well built and sturdy cage, very much worth the price. I just received the cage today (2/26/19) and although the size of it is great. Im kind of disappointed, a few of the seed catcher parts came a little banged up and dented and the cage definitely could have been made more stronger. The bars on the cage are pretty weak (i was able to squeeze them together). I bought this for my green cheek conure. I would not advise anyone to buy this cage if they have anything bigger then a conure or cockatiel, because they will easily pick apart this cage. Generally, it is a nice product.  Small screws for the bottom panels to hold them up together, and 1 stainless food container were missing.  If not a hassle in dismantling the cage to send back, I would have sent it back. Works for our conure and for the price it's great. But if you're going to move it around a lot the wheels aren't the greatest. And the bars can very easily be bent out of shape along with the metal skirt. But again for the price it works. Very nice cage for the price. not recommended for small birds. Budgies could get their head stuck between bars. ", "This is the perfect size for my two cockatiels. The product came in good condition and quickly. It is very nice looking as well. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the size of the food bowls. This cage is clearly meant for small to medium size birds due to the bar spacing and bar thickness. But the food bowls are very deep. My birds are practically hanging upside down to eat. Bought this for my daughters Green Cheek Conure.  Love it. Its sturdy and Extremely easy to assemble. We love this bird cage!!!!! For the price it is magnificent!!! The only and I mean only complaint was the instructions on how to put it together. But I did it alone so it wasn\u2019t that bad just could have been better. Thank you for given us a great bird cage without paying 300 thank you thank you thank you!!!! I was amazed at how beautiful and well made this cage is for the size and price!!  It looks great and was easy to assemble.  The wheels are awesome and you can easily roll the cage to different parts of the house.  Love this product!  had to leave it behind during a move but buying another one asap!  And Juju the Quaker Parrot loves his palatial space and hanging out on top of the cage which is set up with a perch! Even though the intructions are terrible it is really easy to figure out. I was able to put it together by myself in around 30 minutes. Some pieces are bent in some way or another but easily fixed. Please don't let that keep you from buying this cage. I bought a cage from petco for $300 and that one had even more bent pieces than this one did. I think this is a great cage especially for the price. If I was to get more birds I would definitely keep buying more of these cages. Also to make it even better it came with a little screw driver for you to put it together with :) I don\u2019t know why people have such a hard time with this. Took my wife a half an hour to put together, was easy to figure out where the screws go and what goes where. My birds absolutely love it and it\u2019s very attractive. Also- very easy to move! A good cage for the price, seriously! There was some minor dents from shipping but it was to be expected. Had to buy a couple nuts and bolts for the play top because there wasn\u2019t enough. Also, the bar spacing at the bottom is a bit too big for lovebirds so I added some chicken wire to the bottom panel. The stainless steel bowls were actually huge, so I bought some smaller dog bowls. I added some zip ties to the side panels to make sure they stayed in place, since they were a bit unstable. If you\u2019re willing to make some small upgrades that you could easily do at home, I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth the price! For reference I bought the 70\u201d cage! March 1st: 1 week in and I love it.  I have two cockatoos and they love to go back and forth in it.  The instructions were easy don't let people fool you.  Great quality,  great price, im extremely happy. Good quality components, but it's a lot smaller in person than it appears on the advertisement. Even though it's advertised for African grey parrot, too small for a bird of that size to move around. Wow, I thought honestly this would be a cheap product but what a nice surprise. It is very well put together and not difficult to put together. Very happy!!! \ud83d\udc4d ", "I was really impressed with the size of this cage and How  well-made it was, was not expecting this I\u2019ve seen these cages in and around in pet stores for three times that amount sometimes even $400 for the same cage so this case is well worth it\u2019s money It's a good enough cage to hold a small size bird like a cockatiel, you get what you pay for but it's good overall. Assembly is pretty easy just have to kinda guess off of the pictures that's supposed to be called an instruction manual. The screws require the guess work on the first picture the short go on top and long on bottom, putting on the sides the make sure you look at the side with the one food bowl it goes on the left closest to the door then other goes on the same way. The bottom edge pieces is the long smaller screws with nuts and they just slide onto too the cage. The top is whatever screws you have left over The cage is HUGE. My budgies love it, even if it\u2019s a bit to big for their size.. but I saw a a few reviews saying that the food doors were flimsy and unlockable, also they said the bowls were to deep. Well, the bowls are just right, you can lock it too. They just assembled that part upside down \ud83d\ude02. Wasn\u2019t easy to assemble though, so you pass if you assembled it upside down. My pgcc lives like a very privileged bird in this thing.  It's a great value for the money I just wouldn't suggest for small birds. Just medium to large parrots. I read the reviews on this product and even though they weren't perfect I decided to go with it anyway. I thought this product was really good. Yes there were one or two little parts that were bent but in no way made a difference when assembled. For the most part this is a strong and sturdy cage.  It was better than I expected. Even my husband commented that it was really nice and look like a piece of furniture in our living room.  I do only have a little bird in it so I couldn't comment on whether it was appropriate for a larger bird. I will say the directions were the worst I've ever seen. But if I can figure it out I'm sure you can too. I love this cage.  Bought for my future baby Quaker (still with breeder being hand feed).  He will love it since it is big enough for play toys and moving around.  I don't know if I would use it on a larger bird since it would probably damage it. It came with a dented pan and some dented bars. My Timah African grey loves the cage. Why can't the cage manufacturers make it easy to remove the poop shields. The bird loves to sit on the corners and it is very difficult to clean cause it runs down the legs. Great price easy to put together. I thought it would work for my cockatiel, it's too big in several ways. More appropriate for larger breeds. It was also a real b____ to put together. However it seems to be solid and sturdy now that it's done. I am so impressed with these cages! We bought 2 and not only were they easy to assemble but the are sturdy and we are thrilled with the quality! Excellent cage and even more excellent price!! ", "Horrible construction..  took forever and i am good for construction..  just the pits... .the people that put a video..  you put the sides in upside down..  the cups fit just fine.. just the worst to build. I like the cage. It came before the delivery date which was awesome. The only problem is that the top tray is dented in several places and missing the screw for the tray handle. We didn't notice until it was fully assembled or I would have sent it back. I also thought I ordered the black cage but got the grey. It's a nice cage and perfect size for my bird but it really bothers me that the tray is so messed up. Awesome cage for my GCC! Lots of room and East to assemble if you have 2 people. Perfect for our parrot! We put the cage on the back porch during nice weather as Oscar seems to love being outside and it\u2019s very easy for 1 person to move it around. The food/water bowls are very easy to access/clean as they are stainless steel. Seems a bit flimsy initially but so far has served our purposes and he hasn\u2019t chewed through anything lol. He seems to be a happy with our new stuff! Great for large parrot. Not easy to clean in winter.  Must take outer poop catcher off it is a little difficult. In summer just roll whole cage outdoors and hose off.  My lilac crested Amazon parrot love hi cage. We love this bird cage. We have a cockatiel and our bird is super happy. The double food bowl and water bowl is perfect for an active bird like ours. My babies love their new cage! It's definitely a large cage and the play top is an added bonus. It was a little bit hard to understand the instructions but not terrible. Cage was just delivered yesterday. After putting it together all by myself ( about 2 hours. I\u2019m instruction challenged lol ) , my bonded pair of quaker parrots were transferred on over to their new cage. There was nothing bent, damaged or in any other way, wrong with this cage. It was as stated, roomy and well put together for the money. I will buy another of these cages when i get my Tag. Well satisfied birds and owner. This cage could get five stars if it had both horizontal and vertical bars. Smaller birds may  have an issue getting to the top of their cage because they have nothing to grab on to. Really love the look of it though. the same cage at the pet store was over 300 and we have 4 parakeets in it ", "Ok where to start. Well quite a few of the bars were bent really bad and missing hardware. This cage is simple yet complicated especially when it came to the seed catcher. The instructions are impossible and don\u2019t make sense at all. I believe this would be more suitable for 1 small/ medium sized bird. The bar spacing is a little large. This is great... have had it for a few months and it is HUGE for my 2 parakeets.  They love all the room and they even sleep in the food bowl now lol great value. It was a little hard to assemble. Luckily my husband was able to figure it out. It is well made and plenty of room for our 2 conures. Easy to clean. For some reason they keep the play area clean and do their business on the bottom which just slides right out. I did replace 2 of the deep cups for smaller ones for feed. They bathe and drink from the other two. I bought for my african grey a few months ago and it has held perfectly and great size for him. He sometimes bites on the bars although they are sturdy enough not to bend, mishape, or break! Many parts were bent so it took some time to get them back in shape. The medal cups had dents in them. The instructions are very poorly written.  After getting everything together in does look good. Mario, my African gray loves it. It rattles a lot and we had to put zip ties all around the walls to keep them in the slots. The bowls are also way too deep! Dissatisfied. The parts don\u2019t have the number of screw holes to assemble!  I need the seller to contact me! This cage is big tall like a human my parrot likes it and happy with more toys in it to make sure the covers on the side fit where the cage going to be. So take good measurements I needed a cage quick and on a very limited budget. For the price, it's pretty great. I was worried after reading all the reviews about quality control and bent parts. I have to say, it was packed quite well. The edges of the box were reinforced with very thick cardboard strips. Oh, fyi, it weighs about 65 lbs, not 37 as indicated in the description. Might be important for someone to know if they have to pick it up somewhere vs having it delivered to their door. Okay, back to the bent parts. There were two bent wires. One was likely due to shifting in the package during transit and was easily bent back, the other was almost as if it was just welded incorrectly and was a bit too long for the spot that it is in. Anyway, I repositioned it as best I could and it looks fine, just curves out a tiny bit from the rest. Of course it's in the front, but really is barely noticeable now. The trays don't 100% line up, but again, not really that noticeable. Overall I am quite happy with it. I do wish they had made the cage extend all the way down to the bottom tray. Seems like wasted space as it is. The wires are thinner than I was expecting, but should be fine for my baby ringneck. The seed guard was in perfect condition. I was surprised as those are usually mangled in shipping. And all the holes lined up fine on mine. I saw that was a common complaint as well. It took me about 15 minutes to put together by myself. I'm quite good with picture instructions though. ", "This cage is absolutely perfect for my cockatiels! It was incredibly easy to set up. There were extremely minor dents in it, but that's because of shipping and was completely expected. I would add something to the flooring of the cage for smaller birds. You may want to buy some extra perches, since it only comes with one perch for the inside of the cage. Overall, its exactly how its described. Side pieces are a little thin, overall well with the money. Whoever does the shipping needs some supervision . Had a few bent pieces that we were able to straighten out One corner of seed catcher was bent. I used a zip tie to pull together and it worked perfectly. Great product! The only thing is, the picture shows a black color and I received a white ish color. Good thing it\u2019s a nice (marble ish) white, I just kept it that way. The whole thing is really good! The only problems are the instructions are the worst I\u2019ve seen and it was dented but that was a shipping problem. Another thing is I\u2019d recommend buying smaller bowls because if your birds are anything like mine they always have to bathe when you change the water \ud83d\ude02 My Parakeet loves his cage.  It gives him lots of room to play and fly around. Overall nice cage for the money, but directions are horrible, took awhile for me to put together. The directions could be better. How anybody rates this cage one star is beyond me. Yes the instructions aren't the best in the world but it took me less than a half hour to put everything together and I'm not an engineer. I am purchasing a small green cheek con year his cage will be a palatial palace for him. It was half the cost of the store cage and bigger! Not to mention I ordered it on a Sunday and received it on a Tuesday. Would highly recommend It is a nice and study cage. I highly recommend it. the original style cage that is the main picture was not what arrived at my house after contacting yaheetech they had told me that the original cage that is on the main picture is the old model and that what I had ordered was the new updated model. However I did not like the new model as it had shallower bowls for water and food. If there is one thing to take away from this its that the main picture is misleading but overall is still a good cage my birds seem to like it and that's all that matters to me ", "I love this cave and Jasmine loves her new home This is a true bargain...super nice cage...however I'm worried it is too big for my cockatiel.  Nonetheless this exact cage at pet stores costs over twice as much. After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about assembling this cage. I\u2019m so happy to report that I did it myself in 20 minutes. A few little problems in turning screws into the hole but after some pressure it went in. Directions were clear and easy. Its a great product though assembling it was difficult with the instructions not being full. I had to tie several parts together otherwise my parakeet would be able to squeeze through the openings  and escape. Not sturdy but not too bad for the price. Don't be putting anything larger than a conure in it, due to the flimsy barring. My bird loves his new home.  Only wish it had more perches.  Was easy to assemble, it's easy to clean. Functional, well made, great color... It's a really nice cage I like the playground on top This thing is great. My 2 Sugar Gliders love it. Its big enough they can jump around and climb up. They love jumping off the top. This cage is cheaper--and it looks like it. It is very flimsy. I have to put binder clips on the feeding cup doors to keep them closed. I recommend you do not buy this one. ", "The bird cage came in today and it was easy to put together, saw you can see my African Grey just loves it. I will tell my family and friends about you. Satisfied. Cockatoo was able to break the the welds We got this cage for our green cheek conure, I assumed it would have been bigger but our bird is happy with it, especially the top where he can bounce about. My husband did not like the instructions while putting this cage together, there is room for improvement to make it easier to follow. Love this bird cage ! Perfect for small spaces ! Fits my budgie and cockatiel perfect! My parrot upgraded and appreciates the cage very much. I\u2019ll definitely recommend it. Took a while to assemble but end result was doable (after actually reading the instructions carefully). Other than that its sturdy and easy to clean! Love the color, have trouble with the feeder doors, my African Grey has already learned to unlock one! Some of my screws were missing and the cage bars were a bent. Took me an hour alone to assemble it. Not too bad. The instructions were a bit unorganized but able to make out in order. Great cage. Beautiful design and amazing spacing. Excellent product! It\u2019s easy to assemble but it will require at least two people. Easy to clean and really spacious. Very nice cage. A lot of room for the green cheek conure. He loves it because of the space inside and on top and the extra big water bowl. ", "It's pretty simple to put together and is spacious. It's sturdy and I love the slidable tray. It also came with 4 metal food tray and a small rope you for the bird. However some of the smaller bar are bent. Very roomy, plenty of space for upgrades along with their toys. The feed bowls are deep, actually to much for these 2, if the vendor offered shallower bowls they\u2019d be a worthwhile purchase. Love it! Never had a new cage for my caique. Hes not happy bout the tray above him so removed it for now till he gets used to it. Hes whistling and singing lol. Used puppy pads for the old cage and pads fit perfectly in the tray and easy to roll up and throw away. Purchased more toys for him. Veey good quality, well constructed reasonable price. Nice cage.  Big enough for our Indian Ringneck but doesn't take up the whole room.  Had an issue with two piece arriving bent but I was ab le to easily straighten them with a pair of pliers. Would highly recommend! We bought this cage for our teils.. Perfect size, easy to put together and although the sides came a little wonky, they straightened out when put together! Love that it came with the spiral rope also! Okay for the price. One of the wires on the cage did come broken from the welded side. Had to repair that before I could use. There was also a dent in one of the pull out drawers and in the side catch cover I love this cage! Easy to assemble, made of durable materials, stylish looking, and unbelievably roomy! The advertisement doesn't do this cage justice! I will definitely be buying more! It\u2019s a great cage. My pineapple conure loves it. And it came with the rope which was nice ! It\u2019s very spacious for him and he loves hanging out in the top area. ", "Great overall! Just a huge pain to put together. So if you don\u2019t like to put things together find someone to do it for you. I nearly lost my mind putting this together. I have no patience though. This cage is just as advertised. Great buy for the price. Our Jenday Conure loves it. We love it. Get yours today! Good solid cage. Top perch assembly mounting bar screw diameters are incorrect. Cannot use top perch. I bought this cage for my electus parrot and I love it! It's very sturdy and roomy for my bird. The perch on top is great she spends alot of her time up there so it's nice to have the two bowls on top for food and water. My husband was able to assemble it in less then an hour. I would recommend this to anyone shopping for a large cage. We have 3 sun conures in this house. Mom,dad and baby all seem very happy. Easy to clean love the latch on front door they can't escape( which they are all very good at) piece missing when it arrived I contacted seller we had the piece in a few days. Would use seller again! I bought my sun conure and cage set up as a packaged deal for around $1000.00. The cage was nice at the time but it did not offer a lot of space or activities. The cage was 300, this cage has literally brought my bird to the point where she has stopped screaming. She is so much happier and explorative then she was before. I could not get my African grey out to hold him in his old cage...this is so much better and I can let him sit on top . It\u2019s a great cage I wouldn\u2019t put anything bigger than a cocktail or with a very strong beak just because they could beak the wire. I wish so much that I could give a 4 or a 5 star, but their were so many problems. Bent metal, extremely sharp edges (I even cut the top of my finger open), and directions that were very unclear. After an hour with help, we finally got it together the correct way. Being all put together in front of me, it doesn't look bad! I will be getting my bird soon and he will be the true test as to whether this cage is worthy or not. Fast shipping and amazing cage for the price! ", "This cage is so flimsy the bars were bent the wheels bent trying to put them on... Horrible purchase! Purchased about a month ago, and so far, so good!  Easy to assemble, despite some reviews.  One of the bars was bent, but our bird cannot fit its head through, so not a huge problem.  Great cage for a conure!  Looks wonderful in our living room and is easy to clean! Very happy. Assembly wasn\u2019t a nightmare. Easy step by step directions. Birds love it too The metal legs with wheels break if too much weight is applied.  Don't lean your body on it or they will split and break.  If you want a cheap cage with cheap hardware and a clunky, funky design, this will do the job.  It's made for a medium to large parrot. Amazing cage! The price is great and it\u2019s huge! Way bigger than I was expecting. My sun conure has so much space now and is even able to fly within the cage. Great product and great customer service :) Good product This cage is fantastic! Looks really cool. I absolutely love and so does my African Grey! The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is, the gap from the cage to the seed catcher, it should have something between the two. Other than that it\u2019s perfect! None My girls love this spacious home!  And also the playpen on top!  More fun than a barrel of monkeys...they told me so. ", "Love be the style the only fault I found is my Cockatiel has difficulty climbing the front and back panels due to the way the grate runs vertical and not horizontal like the sides do, she slides down often Good cage very nice, it looks like it would not be sold and it is good I would recommend well made- no issue great price Easy to put together with two people.  Best decision to get this cage for our Conure.  Lots of room for another one.  And of course keeps my floors cleaner! The bird cage is an excellent product.  We were moving from New Hampshire to Omaha, NE.  It would have been a great home for \"Tweety.\"  Unfortunately, our bird is no longer with us.  The cage was never used.  At this moment, we would like to return it in the original package. Rust on my new product right out of the box,bends that were easy to get out but still not cool I'd say the rust is what upsets me the most My caique \u201c cuco \u201c is very happy in his new house , very spacious in the mornings he plays in the little playground roof yes I recommend this item! Took some time to assemble but we got it & it's a beautiful cage. My bird loves his new home as much as I love how it functions and rolls around for ease.

A Beautiful piece of furniture. My bird loves it! It was a little difficult to put the bottom catcher on but the picture on Amazon helped me figure it out. ", "Wow. Beautiful cage and well built. Roomy enough for our parakeets to fly around in it. Good value but be careful about the width with seed shirt attached, will not roll through a standard interior door. A simple design change on the width or to the seed skirt to easily detach would fix this issue. It was just right to save space and keep my parrot happy. My \ud83e\udd9c needed a new cage and it's difficult to change them over but this cage worked ! I just got this cage but the feed dishes are too deep for my cockatiels. I would like to know which bowls deciela got from chewy.com and do they fit in same hangers inside cage? Perfect for our green cheek conure...  The bar spacing is perfect, we love the food doors, and the fact that there is bar keeping the dishes in place, so the bird cannot dump them.  We plan on buying a matching cage when we get a sun conure... Wonderful, use it for our cockatiel Fairly easy to assemble. The angled skirt makes a huge difference on bird mess in my living room. My only complaint is that mine cape with a copper colored latch instead of the silver one in the picture and it kind of clashes with the rest of the cage. Great price though. We bought three of these for our birds, they're gigantic, seemed flimsy when I put them together but they've held up great. I suggest these cages to anyone I know with birds. Cage didn't even last 4 months. Started rusting. Contact seller, send them pictures. Never replied back. ", "Turned out to be a great cage. No issues. Everything worked. Very nice and sturdy. Very impressed. Easy to wipe down. My Quaker loves it. It's an awesome cage with the exception that parts of it are bent a bit.  Not bad enough that my hubby couldn't unbend most of it or that it couldn't be put together. Just not happy about the bent pieces because I spent good money on a cage that wasn't suppose to be bent.  Otherwise it we was able to put it together with no problem. Seems to be sturdy enough for my Quaker and plenty of room for him! I would of given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the bent pieces! Great cages and quality!  I ordered two - one for a GCC and one for a Quaker.  Super impressed with these cages!  Lots of room, sturdy build.  I did not install seed catchers, prefer the cages without them.  And not very difficult to assemble either. My blue and gold bite right through this. The cage need to be made with a thicker medal. It is exactly as pictured! Perfect size for my two Quaker Parrots! Would recommend to anyone! A little difficult to put together, but overall very sturdy and the  birds like it. Really good value for a cheap cage. Using it as a temporary boarding cage for an amazon parrot whenever I go out of town. The bars bend easily, but it's secure. It's not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. :) It fit into a smaller room and the birds actually seemed to like the cage better than their older one. The only problem I had in assembly was at the top. The play area wasn't as well defined as the main part of the cage. .

One wire at top was not attached/broken off. I was very disappointed in the cage. It came with a broken door, very weak construction. Threw the box away so couldn't send it back. Wasted 100.00 dollars. My quacker loves this and when hes being good he gets to stay on the top open A nice cage for the price.  Good for mid-size parrots.  Large birds will bend the bars and not have enough room.  Some small birds might have the bars too far away.  Instructions are bad, but it is not hard to figure it out. Assembly is easy but instructions are worthless. I have a green cheek conure and the size is great. I have two complaints though. First the wheels do not lock so I had to leave them off. Second the bowls are too deep. Easy fix was to pick some shallower ones up from my pet store. Cage does clean up very easy so definitely recommend this to conure owners.

This is our second cage for our conures  love the layout that makes them super easy to clean. Putting them together only took about 20 min each even though the directions are a bit vague.  Will definitely buy more if and when we need them. Better quality than the cage I paid 450$ for at the pet store.  This cage arrived well packed and set up easily. Actually a pretty awesome cage for the price. Didn't come bent or broken, all the parts and pieces were there. It only took me and my boyfriend maybe an hour to put it together. Instructions were pretty simple, but we kinda had to force the seed guards together. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. I haven't gotten my sunday conure yet, as he's still being handfed, but I'm hoping he'll love his cage. Great product ", "This bird cage was easy to assemble.

Came a bit dented but I still love it and my birds love it too easy to assemble As others mentioned, the directions were not the best, but the pictures at least gave you an idea of where everything should go, setup with 2 people took about 45 minutes. Shopping online for some nice size cages, the least expensive I could find were about $400 and not as nice as this cage. My wife was in our local pet store & said she saw pretty much the exact same cage for $1500. It's a surprisingly nice cage for how much it costs. Our cockatoo loves to hang out on the top of the cage. I have no complaints other than the directions, but it was pretty easy to figure out. It's exactly what I needed at a great price.

Our Eclectus loves it (though we never close the door). I had the cage for two months and one of the wheels snapped off.  I contacted the manufacturer several times requesting a replacement wheel and did not receive a response.  Amazon refunded the purchase price. For the money you will get a reasonably spacious cage. However, the metal bars bend easily. The quality is, at best, mediocre. I was very disappointed with the cage and will have to buy another of higher quality. I would say that if you are on a budget and have smaller parrots it's passable. Easy to assemble (it did get slightly bent in the shipping process, but I was able to fix it), good size, secure door closures, nice looking cage. I BOUGHT 2, ONE FOR EACH COCKATEIL....EASY TO ASSEMBLE, STURDY...WELL WORTH IT ASSEMBLY This cage is very durable and cheap and it works perfectly for anything around the size of a conure. I love the craftsmanship of the cage its great. While I think of it...you might want to consider buying a unit in which the cage sits on the stand/base. This would make it much easier to move around and be more practical for taking both bird and cage for that long weekend trip. If you look around, Amazon has many 2 piece cages of similar size and price. For example, I have a Giantex type which Amazon sells cheaper that I like as well and is more portable.

Takes a lot of time to assemble, but worth it. My bird loves her cage!! I was disappointed when the cage arrived as some pieces were bent and I had to rebend to get the cage to fit together properly.

I had to go to home depot to pick up new screws and that were slightly larger so the bird cage would fit together nicely.  After all said and done, yes the cage is nice. Awesome! My bird Lance Loves it! It was easy to put together & it\u2019s been easy to clean. Cage is to low so you have to bend over to see in it. Was not built by a bird owner.

My dog put his head through the bottom opening to get a piece of bread that fell on the bottom, and as he was trying to get it out, he bent the catching tray outward. The dog is a small cocker. The cage is too big to fit into doorways so once put together, you are stuck with it in one room (I was hoping to be able to move the cage from room to room). When trying to move it around the room, the bars I held the cage by also bent. Also, my cockatiel does not like this cage. He gets very quiet and non active when put into this cage. I see it's harder for him to climb the vertical bars as he slides down. He is all chatty and social when put into a small cage. We tried to warm him up to it, and tried to wait it out, and organized it to make it appealing and cozy for him. Still the same. He won't even sit on the top bar when let out. For some reason, he avoids this cage when he is out flying around the house. Great product Its kind of small.....but nice !!! Perfecta y f\u00e1cil de ensamblar. None MY COCK.

The cage didn't come with instructions, however it was so easy to put together that I didn't need them!  So happy with my purchase and so is my parrot :) Nice cage but it came with some small broken parts :( Was a tad smaller than I expected but the measurements are honest. Only had 1 bent spot I bent it back. No big deal. Other than that I was satisfied. This cage was way too small for the size bird they advertise it to be for. This is NOT a good cage for medium and up birds. Excellent deal and super fast shipping. Arrived fast, easy to assemble,  nice cage, reasonable price.

Spacing is decent for medium birds (I use for IRN and Hahns Macaw) and bars, flooring seam to be holding up well. I'm about 1 year into it. Amazing bird cage and an amazing price!!

I just had to change the bowls because those were too big for him but I plan to purchase this again for my other cockatiel My African Grey loves his cage but it was challenging to put together and is not the highest quality. But the price was right. I couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase. I have a cockatoo and this item is NOT designed for large birds as advertised.  The horizontal wires are not one piece wrapping around and are instead short pieces soldered on to the vertical wires.  THIS MEANS THEY SNAP OFF EASILY.  My cockatoo was snapping these off as she climbed and ended up quickly escaping the cage. ", "Great size cage! Easy to install.  Looks great! It\u2019s the perfect size for my sun conure!

A little hard to put together, would give 5 stars but some of the bars came bent A bit flimsy, but holding up great.  Needs more perches or ladders and should come with part replacement list for size.  Directions are horrible and used buyers instead of the pictures that came that wasn't even the right cage. ", "Came 5 days late. just ok Easy to put together.  Great for the price. Rusts easily. Came bent from shipping. Had to hammer the legs straight so I could put it together. Low quality. I'm seriously disappointed in this product. It showed up bent and dented in multiple spots and we had to bend it back to shape as best we could to make it work. There's quite a few spots that it's still really noticeable. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my 2 green cheeks appreciate the extra room. Poor assembly directions. Had to guess which screws went where. It's definitely to big for a cockatiel, mine struggles to move parent the cage. My cockatoo chewed all the metal wires around the support pieces. I would not recommend this for an escape artist!! love cage.  It did come with minor damage.  However, I believe that was from shipping as box was damaged.  I did not return since my husband had already put it together before I got home.  Damage did not affect usefulness of cage, so I'm not concerned.  This was my second cage purchase  and I am satisfied with both. What was expected, birds love it! ", "Great customer service. Great cage , had problem with part company fixed quick and easy!

Would highly recommend this one!! Easy to assemble with someone helping, less than an hour. Great cage.  Very well made. Very nice cage easy to put together Great cage for price Very cheap flimsy cage. I would not recommend for birds bigger than cockatiels. This cage is so nice, and easy to put together.

Just received my first  purchase and it didn't even come with half of the pieces let alone all the screws to put it together. I was really excited to put my birds cage together until I figured out that was impossible without the needed parts. Oh and SCREWS! I don't think I'll be using this website in the future.

Happy birds :)))) Good bird cage It's perfected Really good product, I'm very happy and my parrot too. Wow what a great deal on this well built cage,I can't get over the quality of the cage, my cleaning time went from 30 minutes to 5 minutes, the pan with the flare-out design catches 98% of bird seed 5 star x 2.. Flimsey. Not safe. Great cage and great price. Seed catcher works well. Tall cage when bird is using play gym on top. It works great. We've had it for a couple months now. Our bird decided that the best way to make a mess is to fling stuff from on top of the door. It catches most of his messes. Wet messes definitely, dry messes about half or the time. The cage needs to be down in the flange more. My bird likes to go down below and grab stuff that he shouldn't. ", "birds like it, pretty solid . I am Norman the Indian Ringneck Parrot. Instruction or lack of are awful. Cage size is nice but the seed catcher arrived bent so badly it was unusable. It was a little to light duty metal other than that it was ok Poor quality came with bent and broken parts how it got  so many good reviews I don't get it Better then I expected... My parrot loves it. not the best but will have to do It's definitely just a \"made in china\" product with its quirks, but overall, I'm very satisfied with the cage and if you don't want to drop big money on a big cage, I can't complain about this one! Product not high quality as stated very flimsy. You could not put a macaw in this cage as staTed in description.  Gave one star only cause it makes you to summit review I am very unhappy with this cage.  I purchased this cage recently.  To date my Cockatoo has removed about 10% of the bars.  I am 70yrs old and on a pension, but I will definitely have to buy another cage soon.  Do not buy this cage if you have a bird with  a strong beak.  I went into the kitchen to get a little something to eat and before long I heard tiny taps on the floor and my poodle going bonkers barking at something and there was Rico (my bird) walking into the kitchen.  He had squeezed through one of the holes he had made removing the bars, scary , he could have hurt himself, but what a hoot. ", "The name of the item I received matched the listing but I found the bottom pieces to differ slightly from what is shown. For the item itself, one of the side bars was bent (did not affect overall stability and safety). The instructions that came with seemed more like they were generalized to cover the basic setup of the various models out there. I checked them against others who have bought the same item and the instruction pamphlet differed and not all parts for the large cage matched what was in the instructions. Despite missing the bar that holds the food above for the \"playground\" area, overall I am still happy with the purchase as the item shipped and arrived much faster than anticipated during the COVID-19 outbreak and I still got it put together in under an hour by myself. Upper \"playground\" area will now be used for food storage instead! Love this cage! Fairly easy to assemble, and the door is really easy to use while being small parrot proof. The food doors, on the other hand, I had to ziptie closed or my little bird would be running amok. Okay so I scoured the reviews on here and they were incredibly mixed, either saying it\u2019s flimsy and crappy or it\u2019s the best cage since sliced bread. I decided to take the plunge. I, like most reviewers received this cage crazy fast, ordered on Sunday night, it was on my porch Wednesday morning. Two days sooner than even the earliest estimated date. I knew from reviews this thing was going to be bent and 50/50 chance it was poorly packaged so it was about what I expected. All pieces in a cardboard box with a single thin layer of bubble wrap keeping the metal sides from rubbing. Hole in the box but cage wasn\u2019t affected, the little seed guard trays were bent but I was able to bend them back to looking fine with two hands. Didn\u2019t need any additional tools and all bolts and nuts were included with one extra, I always count so when I have an extra at the end I don\u2019t question my handy woman skills. Thought I was going to have to wait til hubby got home to assemble, but I was already a glass of wine in yesterday afternoon so I thought what the heck. I managed to assemble this cage pretty quickly with their mediocre directions and some common sense; I had the one amazon review with the million pictures locked and loaded as backup directions but didn\u2019t even need them. Probably took me 20-30 minutes in total, not counting the toddler and three dogs I had \u201cassisting\u201d. I too found a bent bar here or there but they were all able to be straightened out with a pinch. Using this cage for my Quaker parrot baby and she seems to really like it, even though her dishes are as if she\u2019s eating out of stock pots. Everything was more heavy duty than I expected, and I\u2019m really glad I rolled the dice on this $110 cage, because even on sale, the closest comparable sized cage at petsmart was around $300+. As far as the size, I think a medium bird like my Quaker parrot is really the only size I\u2019d put in this 70\u201d cage, my parakeets would probably get their little heads stuck and I wouldn\u2019t want to put a bigger bird in a cage this size, I think every bird deserves more an an efficiency apartment of a cage. Lol. Our birds spend most of the day out of the cage so the little gym on top was a key deciding factor in this and I\u2019m really digging having a perch I don\u2019t have to move or setup. I say if you\u2019re thinking about this cage and are like me and budget is a concern, you should go for it. It\u2019s a great cage for the price. I have one of these cages for my Sun Conure. He loves this cage. There is plenty of space for toys and running around. The cage guards at the base don't do much good as my bird loves to go to the bottom of the cage and start throwing stuff out of the hole at the bottom. I did not buy this on amazon, but wanted to leave a review here so more people might see it. I was not expecting much after reading the reviews for this cage, so that may be why I was so pleasantly surprised by it. I paid for it late Sunday evening and received it on Tuesday around noon. It was packaged well with very little bending that others have had issues with. The instructions are vague, but using common sense I had it built in less then 30 minutes by myself. HINT: the longer screw are used on the frame, the short thick screws and nuts on the skirt, and the skinnier short screws on the grate lock and playtop. I did put one of the side panels on upside down the first time so that the doors didn't lock, but it was an easy mistake to make and fix. I do work in the pet industry and have built my fair share of cages from the \"big name\" bird companies  (A&E, PH, etc.) And I can honestly say they are not much different other then perhaps the bars being a bit thicker on SOME models. As others have stated this is not a cage for a large, destructive bird such as a too or a macaw, but I got this for a very spoiled cockaTIEL and it is perfect for him. Mine just so happens to have had his toes nibbled shortly after birth by his parents, so the wide perches will be perfect for him. I can see them being too thick for normal toed small birds. But for the price can you complain about having to buy some new perches (which you would need anyway since birds should have multiple places to perch)? I saved hundreds getting this off brand cage (even if I had used my generous employee discount at work) and from experience building other cages I can say it was money well spent. I think those who say it is cheaply made have too high of expectations for a $104 cage and/or are trying to stuff a bird that needs a much larger and heavier duty cage. This cage is more suited for tiels, conures, caiques, lorries, and the like. I would say it is too big for finches and keets dues to bar spacing, not that they could get out, but they could get their head stuck. Macaws, greys, and toos are out because of size and bar strength, even the mini Macaws and toos could eventually snap the bars if they wanted. All in all I am thrilled with it,  and it certainly exceeded my expectations. I would most definitely order again if I ever got another appropriate sized bird. We got this cage as a replacement home for my african grey. On his previous cage he was able to remove several bars on his bottom grate and thus preceded to chew apart his plastic tray.  The new cage came in on the early side of est delivery.  The instructions left a bit to be desired but was able to figure it out  and quickly it together.  Arty did not care for the top tray, kept trying to push it up and letting it drop so he won, removed the top tray. All in all is a very well built cage, puppy piddle papers fit perfectly on the bottom tray making clean up a breeze. Dogs aren't too thrilled that the no longer get bird food to eat. Getting ready to get a new home for my conure and will get him one too. I ordered two separate cages for my cockatiels and my caique. The first one that arrived was in excellent condition and took about ten minutes to put together. However, the sliding handle for the food bowls somehow comes loose sometimes and my tiels can get out that way. The second one was dented in multiple places, which made it difficult to assemble. The food bowl holders were also bent so you when you open the food bowl doors you have to life the bowl out in order to open the door. Apart from the dents in one of them, it\u2019s an excellent cage. Both the caique and the cockatiels love the cage. It\u2019s very sturdy and easy to wheel around. came with side panels slightly bent, instructions are of NO assistance. I have put together many cages as we are a bird rescue. Very flimsy Perches are very large in relationship to the gauge of the metal. A large cockatoo would have a field day with the bars... i put a conure in this cage but had to get new perches as the ones supplied are way too thick for little feet. While the price is ok, I have to wonder if there is not a better quality cage out there........ My daughter received this cage as a gift. Upon preparation of assembling and reading the manual, it was a bit boggling. The part do not explain what part goes to which sides. We needed to undo the bottom grates as there are stoppers for the pullout trays. It does require 2 people to assemble in the beginning and a 3rd to steady the seed catchers. The cage is quite roomy for one conure. I do like the feeding doors and main door are secure and steady. My son purchased this with his own saved money and birthday money. I was helping put it together and noticed bent bars, bent and crooked pieces, missing screw holes and a few other things. We managed to rig it together. I wish there was more quality control. ", "I downsized my Caique and Conure's cage from a mansion to this nic sized cage.  It's a good fit for two small parrots. And they love it and it is a great size for two.  It is a very nice cage, great top play stand attached.  So far they love it and So far I love it and I do recommend this size Sadly my daughter ordered this based on the Photo, which obviously does not match the product. The photo is squashed to make the cage appear significantly wider than it really is. Its an okay cage, but do make sure you check the dimensions vs trying to judge the cage size by the photo with a human standing beside it. It is not even close to matching. This cage is such a good size for parrots such as quakers, conures, cockatiels.. maybe even ringneck. The bars aren\u2019t sturdy so DO NOT try and put a larger parrot like any macaws, cockatoos, Amazons, African greys, etc cause they can\u2019t definitely tear it apart easily and I don\u2019t believe it would give them enough room. But for smaller species I 100% recommend. My Quaker looks so small and has plenty of space and there is lots of rooms for toys. It was easy to put together. Took about 30 minutes tops. Had the same exact cage and it lasted for 12 years, was outside on our Lenai in the FL humidity and heat for 30% of the time. So glad I found the same cage again but this time only better (powered coated) really spruces it up and looks for durable for the FL weather.  Putting it together was easy for me because I disassembled the old cage when it was time for it to go. The seller was great, good communication and the packaging it came in was solid. Very satisfied customer. Highly recommend. Play station on top nowhere to hang toys, cage bars some were bent, plus perches dont fit well.. It saws works for macaws and cockatoos don't believe it! It works great for cockatiels. Not larger cockatoos or tho! An excellent cage indeed TINY MACAW Cage arrived with no assembly instructions. From the look of the box in arrived in ,it had been on many shelves before shipping. I KEEP 10 PARAKEETS ON THIS CAGE AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT. HAD THE CAGE FOR OVER 2 YEARS AND CONTINUES TO HOLD PRETTY GOOD. VERY HAPPY. It is a really great cage!!! about two bars were bent but it was no big problem all you have to do is unbent them with your hands and everything is excellent. I will purchase it again in the future. ", "i use this cage for two sun conure, they so happy and love it it was a good space to play! Ive built several cages for my birds and this one has been the easiest one ive built. The cage was exactly what i wanted. Ibought it for my sun conure who has plenty of room to jump around and play, i could even have a second sun conure in there. 10/10 cage and price. The guy only 4 ft tall Fairly. Ice cage for the price. Side wire is thin and won\u2019t hold larger wood perches. The feed cups are a little too large and deep. I found some shallower cups I can use. All said, it is a good first cage for our bird.  Will probably replace in a few years. My mom purchased this for my daughter for her birthday (im getting her a pineapple conure) it took me about and hour and a half to assemble. It seems great so far. I pick up our little guy soon and I'm hoping he loves it. I got this cage today for my 2 green cheek conures and it is a very suitable cage for them. Best quality cage at the best price. My wife loves it. It is a good cage for the price. Our bird loves it as well. I love it Great cage, easy to assemble.

Great size, small enough for me to carry, yet comfortable for my little red face lovebird. The included accessories work, and there is still room for other toys. I do however wish that there was a bottom rack, so that my bird doesnt have to stand in her droppings when she explores the bottom of the cage. I have a strange use for this item but it works perfectly for my needs. I like to grow herbs indoors but my cats love to eat those herbs. Some of those herbs are dangerous to cats so I decided to look for some kind of small cage. This fit what I needed. It's tall and wide enough. There are also several easy to access points. The top comes off easily enough as well as the 2 doors in the front. I have no idea how this is as a bird cage but I imagine having birds in it would be fine. It's sturdy. I might not trust the doors to stay closed if I had an animal inside, though. They kind of click into place but it isn't significant. I think I'd feel safer if I clipped the doors shut somehow. Maybe with some kind of twisty tie or hair clip. This is a tiny cage if for birds as intended. I would only use this for traveling and not as a home. good price, 2 feeding cups, 2 perches plus a swing. it also has a pull out tray so that's a major plus. Um... wow... uh... I wasn't expecting this to be so small. I like this cage because I can hang it on my wall and my parakeet spends quite a bit of time outside of this cage with my other bird so it works perfect for night time for us if you're Bird spends a lot of time in their cage I would not recommend it. Same as every other review, will preface by saying this is not a full-time cage for any bird (hopefully no one is seriously buying this thinking that...) but is a nice size for smaller birds' lightweight travel cage and perfect to take with you out for some sunshine etc. It would make a decent sleep cage as well but my guy does great sleeping in his flight cage so haven't bothered. I didn't have my hopes up very high, I imagined \"its a bird cage how can you mess it up\" but when I got it and put it together I was so happy it was SOO cute and the PERFECT size for my little budge. And I didn't notice it matches her color (bonus).  When I got her inside it really is bigger than it looks from the outside. The bowls fit nicely and don't fall/tip over, and the rods are pretty solid when installed. Shes not too sure about the little swing but I have it in there anyway cause its TOO CUTE.  The only thing its missing which isn't really a drawback necessarily is having a swing open door on the front so you can access the entire cage without having to stick your hand through the sliding doors. If you were handy and had the tools you could probably fashion it to do this but like I said its still fine as is. Would/will buy again. I bought this to be a traveling cage for my one budgie. He has a much larger main cage that I don't mind traveling with, but vet appointments are better with a smaller cage. None Built this traveling bird cage per the instructions. I should have kept reading more reviews regarding the bottom portion... We bought this to take our Birds to the vet to clip their wings, however upon traveling the bottom portion fell off for no apparent reason and we lost one bird save your money and save your birds do not purchase poor quality ", "This cage makes a great travel cage for birds and rodents alike. I use it mainly as a \"playpen\" for my 2 rats; their full time cage is too large to move around so for playtime, i put them in this small cage with the door fixed open and food and a water bottle so they have a place to dart in and out of. It keeps them comfortable during free roam time. I also have used it to transport my rats when moving house, it works great for that too. That being said, this cage is not an appropriate size to be a full time living area for any animal. Not mice or rats or canaries or budgies. It is way too small to be a full time living space. Number one warning to those looking at this cage is this is only a proper cage for travel or temporary housing. I bought this to take my bird to the vet and to ride in the car on camping trips and was so excited to get it because the travel cage I have now is too big. This cage did not clip together. There was nothing to hold the bottom plastic part to the wire part. I have put together many cages but this cage had nothing to secure the bottom to the wire and the roof either. So it's just 3 pieces sitting on top of one another...useless. I don't ever write bad reviews but this would have put my lovebird in danger so... I\u2019m using this cage for two parakeets/budgies as a travel cage and cleaning cage. Don\u2019t use for normal everyday cage!! Included perches, bowls, and swings were great except I only got 3 perch hooks instead of four. Wasn\u2019t the end of the world but would be nice to have all 4. Other than that it arrived in 1 and 1/2 days. Recommend buying. This cage is little over priced for the size. Build quality is good with basic accessories. But please note under any circumstances you should NOT use this cage as main cage for bird of any size. Not even finch or love birds. It is too small for any bird's healthy and happy living. I bought it for occasional travel and for my bird's night sleeping area, in day she spends in a 6 feet cage or free flying around home. I bought this birdcage for my grandsons cockatiel, he looked at the dimensions and said it would be big enough, but when I got it and assembled it it really was a little too small. This cage was a really nice cage and I wish it had been big enough so we could\u2019ve kept it. I had no trouble returning it and I would order from them again. It's cheap and light and I'd keep my hand on the bottom just to be sure.  I used it to move my conure 900 mile by car.  It was big enough for a long one day drive and small enough to sit on the front seat of my car.  It would be fine as a permanent cage for a small bird like a finch, but I'd only recommend for temporary uses. We have a larger cage (same brand) at home, but this cage is perfect for travel. We travel with 2 dog crates & lots of dog \u201cthings,\u201d which doesn\u2019t leave much room for the birds & the cage can\u2019t be next to the dog crates. Fits perfectly in the back of the SUV with the luggage & they get lots of light from the back window. Happy chirping sounds the whole trip. When we get to our destination, the cage hangs easily. This cage is the Betta bowl of bird cages. It is suitable for keeping your bird contained and alive* but you should be actively working on doing better for your pet. I see a lot of people using this cage as a travel cage, I would be terrified to do that. I had to bend wire back into shape to get this cage together and I couldn't use some of my spare toys and perches without distorting it. They make hard sided bird carriers that are not far off from this size and price range. I have two I got at petco. I don't know what people want for $14 but I have to tell I LOVE this cage.  I keep my canary's main cage clean and hate putting him him a small box while I do that.  This is a GREAT cage for going to the vet or as I said a temp cage for when you clean your bird's cage.  Yes it is small up to a parakeet for the things I mentioned but not for a main cage.  Not enough room.  I cleaned his cage today and was not stressed while I took his main cage apart to clean. ", "We use this cage to take our Cockatiel outside with us to get some sun and just hang out. We take the top off and on to put her in as opposed to using the door. I like this brand because I KNOW they use bird safe paint. This cage works for what I need it for: travelling short distances with my small bird.  I would NOT recommend putting ANY animal in a cage this small for long periods of time.  It is far, far to small for that.  It could possibly be used for a sleeper cage, but even then it would have to be a very small bird. I'm used to judging macaw cages, I would say this is a delicate cage that I would be afraid to drop. I needed a rescue/hospital cage for wild birds to recover. One that I could hang if needed, away from the cats. I usually get fallen nest in the spring and can't reach high up. I planned on putting the nestlings in the cage (open door) for parents to takeover in a secure spot. I got this for a \"travel cage\" for my conure.  Very nice cage and can't beat the price! The cage doesn't have a screen on the bottom so the bird stands on its poo. The picture doesn't show this so i'm so disappointed in this purchase. The cage is so tiny i feel bad my bird had to stay in it.  I got rid of it and purchased a larger one as my tiny bird couldn't even fly in it.  It's more of a transport cage if that. It was easy to assemble. I wouldn't recommend it for a bird to live in full time but it's a great size if it's just temporary or for traveling. I got it for my 2 budgies to have some time outside in to get some natural sunlight, warmth and fresh air. and it's perfect for that. I rescued 2 baby lovebirds from the ground beneath our Saguaro tree.  They live 15 years, and I really wanted them to be wild.  After days in shoe box I got this cage.  Perfect to leave outside during day with door tied open. The parents returned and helped raise! After a few weeks they fledged! A happy family. Babes still return to rest inside at cool misters. 100+\u00b0 F here.  Portability and size great for little ones temporary home. Tee shirt covered for coziness. For the price, this is a great cage. I only use it as a travel cage, as it would be too small for a permanent cage for any bird other than maybe a finch or other tiny bird. No problems with the construction, overall very happy, especially for the price! I bought it for a cocktail. The cage is very small and shouldn't not be advertised for birds larger than 5 inches. The bigger birds will be under stress in such a small bird cage. Also, you must secure it better. I used strings to tight it and keep the cage safer for the bird. My bird fortunately has a much bigger bird cage. I bought the small bird cage for trips to the vet. To small for anything.  Perches are plastic and hard on birds feet.  Bowls are too small to hold enough water or food for a day for even a finch.  This same company has a nice large cage available on Amazon prime for just over $40.  Go for that one for size and your birds sake! ", "I bought this for my budgie as a travel cage, but the door is just way too small! I wish I could be able to put her into the cage while she was on my finger. I feel like the only way to get a bird in there is to grab her, which is super not useful. Sorry but this cage has a crappy design. I couldn\u2019t get the cage to lock with the base and cage to lock with the roof. Ended up using zip ties to hold it together. Using this as a traveler cage so I\u2019ll be keeping it. It\u2019s cute, love the color and it\u2019s affordable. Cute LITTLE cage.  NOT big enough for a Parakeet.  Maybe 1 tiny finch at the most.  I use it as a \"travel\" cage for sale and pick up new little birds but would never leave them in it overnight! We purchased this cage for our parakeet to sleep In at night because my cats bother him in his daytime cage. It\u2019s perfect for this. But it would be way to small for day time hanging out. This is not a cage you would use long term for any size bird its just to small. But to use as a travel crate it is a good size. I have used it for my parakeets and my cockatiel when I need a temp cage or travel cage. It has worked fantastic. Sop Again this is not an appropriate size for any size bird long term. For temporary purposes its ideal. This was the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  The bird cage was broken when we got it.  The bottom is made with very flimsy plastic, and the actual cage didn't go together at all.  It was not made well, and didn't fit together correctly.  We sent it back the same day we got it. I bought this to put my parrotlet in when we sit out on our patio.  It is the perfect size for this.  I wouldn't consider using it as a permanent home because it is too small.  He will be very happy to be outside in this.  It isn't the best quality, but suits the purpose and was a good price. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure.  I live in Southwest Florida and needed a cage asap to evacuate my bird in before hurricane Irma hit.  The cage is small, but perfect for what I needed.  I am greatful for Amazon prime shipping for getting the cage to my location just on time! Excellent sleep cage for lovebird.  Not recommended for pemanent cage, too small for any bird. This is very cute. I have a Parrolette and purchased this to carry her back-and-forth to the vet. It would be much too small for any bird I can think of, as a home ", "I was somewhat reluctant to buy this one bc of the size but it's meant to be a travel cage...the base can be easily broken the metal cage came warped and the doors dont even stay closed so a bird could easily open it and escape. Spend a little extra and go with something else. Good little cage! Perfect for small birds! We used to when we rescued a baby sparrow, once it had fledged and wanted to learn to fly. This cage is very small.  It is built well but really should only be used as a temporary cage or a travel cage.  My only problem, other than the size, was with the plastic perches.  The ends of the perches are also plastic and very flimsy.  I doubt they would last very long. Wouldn't hold up very well with daily use but it works as a travel cage or for a newly weaned baby bird. I think the price is a tad high for what you're getting. I bought this cage to transport my bird. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. Some people travel with dogs, I travel with my bird and this cage is a great deal for the money! Used it to raise a baby wild bird. Will put plants in it now. Wife likes the size and design. I bought this to pick up my bird from the bird store. It was a good size and easy to assemble. I did take it apart completely to clean it. It\u2019s a great cage for a smaller bird but it is way too small for any bird other than a parakeet at best. The only reason I got it was so that I could put my cockatiel in when I picked him up or if I need to take him somewhere. It\u2019s a great cage for short trips but I would never use this as my cockatiels cage! Good size for what I need it for..the only thing I'm not happy with is I was double charged.. This cage is TINY!  I'd never put a pet bird in here for longer than a day or so, however I had an injured finch in the yard and I'm keeping it in here until it heals.  Works well for this purpose.  Its easy to put together. ", "Very tiny thats my fault for not reading dimensions but everything for the cage is made out of cheap plastic This does good for 1 parakeet or small bird. Its nice. Not very good , few days later and it\u2019s trash The cage was way smaller than I had expected. I think it would be an okay size for an outdoor cage for a parakeet or smaller. The construction of the cage itself is pretty flimsy (easily bendable), but we're able to make do with it. Got this as a great value, use it to take parakeet to vet when necessary. Would not recommend using this as a full time home for a bird as it's just too small. But good for travel situations Smaller than I expected but can fit my Quaker parrot for the short time it takes to clean his regular cage. Not good for long term unless you have a very small bird. Small but ok for the price. This product is good for 20$ and 20$ only great small cage for a very small price. The cage is small and could never hold more than one small bird. This mini cage looks okay for the design, but the problem is lack of grid at the bottom of the cage, so the bird will jump around with its dropping and carries it everywhere. ", "Very flimsy. Only product I have ever returned to Amazon. When assembled it did not feel secure enough that I would place a birdie inside. Awesome cage just right size for a parakeet makes cleaning easier. I needed something to put my cockatiel in while I took his cage outside and gave it a good scrubbing. This little cage fit the bill. I would use it for my purpose or for transporting a bird, but it is too small for a permanent home. Great value for the price. Perfect size for travel. Doesn\u2019t have a floor lining to prevent birds from going after their poop, food or whatever on the floor. NEED TO ADD THIS IMPORTANT PART TO ANY CAGE!!! For the price is too little Much smaller than what the picture shows We purchased this to transport our budgie to the vet. It was perfect. I bought this product as a travel cage for my parrotlet. It was easy to put together upon arrival and perfect for what I ordered it for!! The perches are cheap plastic and so is the swing. But, for the price you can't beat it! I would not recommend this as a permanent house for your bird, but perfect for travel! I loved it very reasonable price ", "My bird where opining up the feeder doors and flying out. Very useful and practical, since I can walk it wherever I want in the house, so that I don't feel alone and wherever I go inside the house. Good for extra small Budgie birds !

Small cage Easy Assembly Perfect small cage for travel and for when I need to clean the bigger cage I can transfer my parakeet quickly over.

Very dumb cage to sell for a LIVE bird.  Unless you have one FINCH, this cage is a joke.  The seed cups that came with it don't even work with this cage and there is no grill for the bottom of the cage so that the bird is not walking in it's own waste!

Still, it is cute and if you want it simply for d\u00e9cor or for a very small bird...maybe a finch...I guess it would work. This was a cheap and flimsy cage and it showed up bent...I guess you get what u pay for Too small. Not what I thought very small I love ... Instructions for installing the feeders are iffy, but the enlarged image on Amazon was helpful.  Bought this as a travel cage for my 2 budgies, definitely not a permanent home for them.  Dimensions are slightly misleading and the length/depth refer to the length/depth of the bottom blue plastic base.  The actual cage length/depth are about half an inch smaller.  Height of 15 inches is to the peak of the roof.  Maybe Prevue should have an image showing the dimensions. It's a cute little cage but I think that the dome top is a bit deceiving...I wish it was just a tad bit bigger. It seems a bit small for my small conure to move around in but I think it'd be fine for a parakeet. I'm also bummed that it doesn't have a bottom grate. I knew that before I bought it but still. Parakeet refused to enter such a small space. ", "Easy to assemble, easy to clean. My little birdie loves it.. TOO SMALL, we got a parakeet from Pet Smart and was going to put our new bird in here until it got use to our old bird (who is in a big cage) but this poor small bird couldn't even turn around in this cage, his tail feathers were being ripped out.

Great product It is smaller than I thought I got it for a canary going to have to buy a different one I would use it for  declaration not a live animal Great bird cage for my Zebra Finch. It's nice -good This is a VERY small flimsy cage. It should be noted it would only be a travel cage. It is good for that but it would be cruel to keep any bird in something this tiny.

Paid 14.97 but they want to charge me 6.95 to ship it back...SMH.  I added it  on Moms on a budget and sold it for the same price!! This cage is good as a travel cage ONLY. Do not use it as a bird's main cage because it is WAY TOO SMALL even for a budgie/parakeet! For a travel cage, it's decent and sturdy. Too small for anything but the smallest bird like a parakeet and even then only for temporary use like traveling.  Way too small for a cockatiel.

My parakeet loves it. She's a little one so its a perfect cage for her. She's uncomfortable in big spaces due to being kept in a cage not bigger than this one at the pet store with multiple birds. My little Castiel loves jumping between the different levels I have for her. The food and water dishes are so easy to remove and you don't have to open the main door to get them out. I added a few more toys for her and she seems content. This cage is very very small. Only good for very small birds like a Finch. It's only good for transportation purposes as a bird should not be keep in a tiny cage. I would recommend for tiny birds only for transportation purposes only. This cage is so small! I ended up buying a cage that was much bigger only for an extra $10. I would not recommend buying this unless you live in a small studio apartment with a tiny bird. for the price it is good. I have two parakeets. it is just missing the metal grate part that goes over the bottom tray. It does not come with it, and is not a necessity I suppose. I just use this as a travel cage or a temporary cage anyway. I would NOT use this as the main cage for even one parakeet. It is far too small for that. This is good cage for taming, sick/treatment or transporting. We have a larger cage to move this guy over too after we tame him. This is a nice cage for temporary use! You can\u2019t beat the price and it is a good quality for the price! This is makes for a great travel cage. NOT to be used for full time gage for any bird, it would be cruel. Seriously, it's barely 1 square foot of space. I bought this cage for our new baby parakeet. This is our first bird, so I wasn't sure about everything that I would need, so I just started with the very basic items. This cage is very small. It is serving it's purpose right now while he's small, but I am already shopping for a larger cage to move him into. I will keep this one as a spare or a travel cage if I ever need one. But, this cage is too small to keep him in long term. He's fine for now, but I can't wait to get him a larger cage! ", "wonderful product!!! i use this as a travel cage or if i want to take my birds outside. this cage is a good size for my 2 parakeets but if you have a bigger bird like a conure it would be snug. i wouldn\u2019t recommend it to be a cage that they are in 24/7 but if you are takin them to the vet or somewhere else it\u2019s perfect because it is super light as well ! mine has lasted 8 years!! THIS IS A TRAVEL CAGE!! Do not use this for a permanent cage! You can have it for a sleeping cage but let them out all day. DO NOT KEEP YOUR BIRD IN THIS ALL DAY! \ud83d\udc4d Me encanto muy linda y buena None "]}, "/Prevue-Products-Wrought-Hammertone-3151BLK/product-review/B000FRV3M2/ref=sxin_8?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.ef1da085-1d5b-40ea-aa2d-93ddd31edc5c.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B000FRV3M2&cv_ct_cx=bird+cage&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.ef1da085-1d5b-40ea-aa2d-93ddd31edc5c.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source&dchild=1&keywords=bird+cage&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B000FRV3M2&pd_rd_r=fec38a05-f674-4c26-acf4-68fde91642ae&pd_rd_w=oJYhM&pd_rd_wg=x4PZR&pf_rd_p=76540515-1aa7-4007-99bf-d21bc7d2acc8&pf_rd_r=YP0VHPJBEWQVA3M5WCDM&qid=1595871976&sr=1-4-72d6bf18-a4db-4490-a794-9cd9552ac58d&tag=5042nst800sr-20": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["Wrought iron select cages offer quality craftsmanship at an affordable price (It is a cockatiel cage)", "4 Stainless steel cups, 2 wood perches, cage stand, playtop and rounded seed guards are included", "Heavy-duty push button door lock keeps your bird secure.

My conure loves it and it is the perfect size for him. I would say this cage is too small for anything bigger than a 'tiel though. It might fit a small amazon. This is a great product. Our Green Cheek Conure has never been happier-- seriously! While in every enclosure previous to this, he would either mope, or screech with disapproval. Since giving him his new home, he is much better-mannered and flutters from side to side gleefully. I don't know if others will experience the same, but our buddy loves it. I purchased one of these cages from the pet store I work at once in a desperate quick cage upgrade for one of my cockatiels. I didn't give much thought to it at first, and just bought it on my way out of the store figuring it was the nicest one we had. I was absolutely correct and now feel like this cage is THE BEST bird cage there is and recently purchased a second one from amazon (the price is much better online). The other bird cages I've used are terrible to clean, you have to separate the bars from the bottom in order to really clean them, most are bulky and hard to move, even other cages that have a metal grate like this one aren't as easy to clean. This prevue cage has a grill that slides out like a drawer, and a bottom tray that's really deep for messy birds. Once both are out its a straight drop to the bottom, with means nothing else gets mess on it. The play gym top is optional to install, along with the top tray, but my birds love it, I only have to open the door then they climb right up. The cons of this cage aren't too terrible, the bars at the bottom (along the sides of the tray) need to be wiped off often, and the seed guard is useless with cockatiels. they crunch their food and launch it at warp speed vertically out of the cage. Overall I love this cage. I plan on buying a larger size for my Green cheek conure. This cage came much quicker than the delivery date showed.  It arrived in great shape.  No damage other than a couple minor surface scratches.  No big deal.  The cage is beautiful.  We couldn't decide between the 18\" and the 20x24\" cage.  We opted to get the larger one (20x24).  So glad we did.  We have 2 Cockatiels in it with lots of toys and there is plenty of room.  The smaller cage would have been a little tighter.  So we made the right call.  We love it and the birds love it.  Only thing is the birds can't get to the play area on top without help so we will have to get something to hang there to help them. I have a green cheeked conure, and I bought the 18 x 18 x 57. I assembled it myself in about 1.5 hours, and it was pretty easy. It's a great cage and it's very heavy and sturdy. I feel like some of the things on it are actually a little too big for a cockatiel or a small conure - the playtop on the top feels awfully big to me for his little feet. You'll need some kind of a ladder or something hanging over the side so your bird can climb from the door to the top. I just put it together and while putting it together paint was literally chipping off all over the place. That one: is just not safe the bird because he can ingest it and I am soooo upset about that and two the cage will prob rust now which also is not safe.  That alone right there is a huge disappointment esp for the price I paid to have the whole thing chipping apart. The location of the cups suck and the way it is set up makes it impossible to put a different bar in the cage in between the cups. You have to use the perch that comes with it, since its dab smack middle in the center it makes it hard to set up other perches around that one with enough room/ease for my bird. I'm seriously all around not happy with this cage, it also came with the most horrible god awful miserable smell to it. I washed all the pieces and it still reeks. Why does it smell so bad!!!!! I waited last min to put this together before moving and now im in debate about what to do...either way its getting trashed or returned...Im praying to find something this weekend for my bird or I'll be out for a cage that cost me over 100 bucks. I have been building these cages for years and I have never been so disappointed in receiving such a damaged cage. Building these things are a piece of cake for me but this one made me want to die. After finally getting the \u201chard\u201d parts out of the way that they suggest having a \u201cenlisting a friend to help with\u201d I went to attach the top and everything is off by a smidge so it won\u2019t go on. This isn\u2019t user error, I worked at a pet store for 8 years and worked in the bird department. I literally built these cages for a living and have 6 of them of my own. I guess the quality has gone down over the years. I\u2019m so disappointed. My cage doesn\u2019t have a top...the other pictures show bent areas of the cage and a broken off piece where the tab should go to connect the sides to the front and back. The grate is warped on the top as well. I bought the 36x24x66 (black hammertone) cage for my African grey!  She is adopted and came with an ENORMOUS cage that forced me to take doors off hinges in order to take it outside for cleaning :( This review is on the putting together of the cage after receiving it in the mail only !  First of all, I have seen lots of comments on the box not being complete with all the parts and a strange smell, etc.  The cage we received (the 18x18x57) had none of that.  It came complete, well packaged and in excellent condition.  Secondly, I have seen comments about the instructions to put it together being incomplete and basically just pictures of how to put it together.  Again, totally different than what we received.  For someone who has put together any type of products (furniture, toys, etc) this will be a breeze.  Step by step instructions were provided and the pictures for the most part were spot on.  The only part that was a bit confusing was the very last step of putting together the seed skirt. But after a few minutes it makes sense and you almost feel like a dope for not understanding what was listed.  The build process took about 90 minutes to complete.  It took two of us (me, 53 yr old dad and my 18 yr old daughter) to finish.  The only tools needed were the enclosed allen wrench and at the end a pair of needle nose pliers (helps hold the nuts when fastening the seed skirt.  The second person is needed a few times just to have another set of hands.  Bottom line recommendation based on my experience:  GET IT !  We are waiting on our cockatiel baby to be weaned so we can bring it home from the breeder.  I cant see this cage not being perfect for him because it is well built, easy to put together and it seems very sturdy !!  If I remember, after we receive our bird and he has been in the cage for a bit, I will update this review, but again, I cant see why this cage wont be perfect for a cockatiel or anything smaller !!! ", "After searching several sites/stores for a large bird cage with a seed catch, we decided on this one. While it was on the pricey side of what we were looking for, it had great reviews and everything we needed. Received this cage with all parts, but not all parts fit the cage!  The holes in the panels of the lower food-catching wings did not match up, causing us to not be able to utilize all the screws as intended.  The top ladder is completely manufactured incorrectly.  It is 1 step too long, and completely does not fit into the holes.  As a result, we had to buy zip ties to hold it together.  The entire set was a disappointment.  We tried to contact Prevue directly at (312) 243-3624 to resolve the problem directly, as we preferred to get replacement parts than shipping it back to Amazon (tedious and very heavy to assemble, let alone take apart and taxi over to UPS since I live in a secured building without a concierge), but unfortunately, no one from Prevue ever returned our calls. Shipping was quick and the cage arrived well-packaged.  So well it practically took me longer to open the box than to set up the cage.  I am a 67 year old widow and had no help putting the cage together but still managed to do it in just over an hour.  Probably would have taken less time if I had actually read the directions!  LOL  I got this cage because of the seed guard.  Not because my bird throws her seed when she eats, it was more for her pooping when she is outside of the cage, which, by the way, is all time unless it's night.  It's also the reason I chose the white color.  It matches her poop!  I do have one of those plastic things you would put under a desk chair, but got weary of having to wash it off every day.  This new cage helps with that.  In a way, the cage is TOO overdone.  I failed to see the reason for a tray on the bottom AND the top and, therefore, am only using one of them.  The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars is that the play top perch set-up was not drilled correctly.  There are supposed to be two sets of holes to hold the feed/water cups but they were underneath the perch setup not on top the way they were supposed to be.  Fortunately that error didn't bother me since I had no intention of using them anyway.  If Sophia (my 5 month old) cockatiel wants food, then she can just march herself in the cage and get some!  Hope this information helps. I got this as a replacement for a cage that I had that was similar size but very plain. I kept ending up with A LOT of bird food on the ground and my bird making a mess of the newspaper I was laying down, causing a mess. With this cage, there's the shield around the bottom, which while not 100%, was at least minimizing the mess. Also the tray with the newspaper is under a bottom grill that is the bottom of the habitation section of the cage, meaning my bird CAN'T create a mess of the newspaper that's supposed to be collecting poop. The only complaint I'd have is the tiny little tab that is at the top edge of the door, which you have to move out of the way to open the door. But it's not a deal breaker. I did remove the collection tray that goes on the top for the play area. With it in, the interior of the cage became very dark, cave-like. It's the same size as the bottom tray though so it makes it easy for cleaning purposes instead! We have the 18X18 for 1 Cockatiel, we have the 20X24 for 1 Green Cheek Conure, and the 36X24 for 1 Ducorps Cockatoo.  The largest cage came in damaged three times.  All 3 times it was the catch pans that arrive with significant dents.  We are going to make due with the dents on this 3rd cage since I'm sick of shipping back and forth.  The large cage also doesn't feel as sturdy as the smaller 2 cages.  I would not buy the largest cage again and would buy a different brand for the larger sizes. I bought this cage for my green cheeked parakeet. Less than a month after having it I took it outside and washed it. I used mild soap, rinsed it with a regular water hose on very low pressure, a bit more than a trickle. I then dried it with microfiber clothes and brought it inside for use. I was pleased with how easy it cleaned up. About a week later I saw rust where all the hinges were. I saw rust where the food dishes sit as well as every area where the cage had corner or came to a point was rusted. I was so disappointed, the cage was worthless. This cage doesn't disappoint. The 20x24 is perfect size for your cockatiel to keep tail feathers looking good and not frayed from hitting bars in a small cage.  It was SUPER easy to put together with very clear instructions.  I put it together alone and it took me (a girl) about 45 minutes, if that long. I don't understand complaints of wheels smelling. Mine had no smell or oily substance on them.  It was packed very well and was undamaged. All parts slipped together and lined up perfectly. Even the screw holes lined up perfect! It's sturdy for a cockatiel but I would not put a larger bird in this size due gauge of bars.  I think my conure could bend the cage wires if she were destructive.  The bar spacing and gauge of bars are perfect for my Cole, the whistling wonder that was passed around from home to home, until I adopted the little booger.  He could shame a New York construction worker with his wolf whistle....he's that good. Now he has a castle of a cage befitting a beautiful bird. The item was delivered on time. It was easy to assemble, and had only minor nicks and bends. The hex tool is not the greatest. way too soft it got rounded easily, luckily I had plenty of others.  I love the cage, perfect for what I need it for. I wanted something  as small as possible but still plenty of vertical space for the long tail of my IRN. The spacing is just right, 3/4\" is from middle of the wire to the middle of the next, the gap is actually 5/8\". The top is 50 and 1/4 inches high with the wheels on, without the perch on top (this was a piece of information I couldn't find anywhere, hope it helps someone).My bird loves it. Having said that, it is too small for a main cage for an IRN, not enough turn around room (in my opinion, mine lives in a 30x30), but I needed something in my open concept living area that I can lock him in when I'm cooking or doing other things that can be dangerous for him. The color is great, the wider spacing makes this small cage more airy looking. It is very easy to clean. Would give it 5 if it weren't for the minor paint chips. I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I\u2019m just so disappointed with this cage for the price that I felt I had to. First impression of this cage is that is bent coming right out of the box, paint is chipped off already, and there is rust. There is no way that is healthy for my parrot, and considering the longevity of the cage if it is already rusting it just means with regular cleanings that it will rust even more. I also have no doubt in my mind that she will probably be pulling the paint off of it in no time, considering paint is already coming off and how easy it was falling off while putting it together. I highly do not recommend purchasing this cage for the fact that if your parrot ingested enough of the paint from this cage it will most likely get sick. Purchase at your own risk. Very nice, sturdy cage. A lot to put together. I received mine horribly damaged and I had to bend it somewhat into shape so I could use it for a bird that needed a cage immediately. I contacted the manufacturer to purchase the damaged pieces and they didn't return the email. Again I tried. A week later they responded that the pieces were on backorder and they didn't know how long it would be. 6 months later, still no replacement parts. If you buy this, hopefully you never need their assistance. ", "I bought this cage as a second home for my double yellow to have someone watch her when I'm out of town.  I cannot transport my current California Cage back and forth. I would rate the Prevue Cage as 5 out of 1 to 10.  My Cal Cage would be a 9/10, strong and sturdy, one solid piece.  The Prevue cage has to be assembled, it is easy and takes about an hour.  The cage bars are very thin and easy to bend, the finish has small chips on it and one corner had some bad damage on it.  The main perch that goes inside the cage has a large crack going through it and the latch for the door has a bad finish as well.  I attached some pictures with all the issues I found.  I will keep the cage as it will serve as a descent temporary cage for my bird for when I am out of town.  I would not use this type of cage for an everyday cage for my bird after seeing the better quality from my other cage. I was actually really surprised by the quality of this product. Many of the screw holes do not align properly, and the screws are poorly made. This resulted in me stripping 2 of the screws with the provided tool, and causing me to have a partially assembled cage that is unsafe for my parrot, but impossible to disassemble! Additionally, the perches, side walls, and seed-catcher bottom tray were bent, and warped terribly (which, to some extent, I expected based on previous reviews...but it was much more than I imagined). The tray beneath the play surface would've been nice (besides not having a grate to keep feet off from the tray), and the bowls are of good quality. I did not have any issues with rust or chipping paint on any surface that the bird would be in contact with (though there was some on the very bottom where the tray is put in)  I give three stars due to Amazon's amazing customer service, and the fact that it would be a really nice cage... if I would've been able to use it..... This cage was a NIGHTMARE to put together. It took me every minute of 2 hours. A piece of the cage was broken when I received it, the wooden perches gave me a splinter, the cage had brown stuff all over it, the \"touch up paint\" was so watered down, it didn't even begin to cover the spots that needed touching up straight out of the box. I had to pull and stretch METAL to get things to fit where they were \"supposed\" to go. I finally make it all the way to the last step which was the seed catcher. That piece of utter garbage would not go together no matter how much I twisted and pulled and tugged and bent it. I spent so long making the damn thing, I'm not going to take it apart to send it back. I will never purchase from this company again. This was my first bird cage and lesson learned. Spend more money for a better one or buy one from somewhere else where they put it together for you. I am completely and utterly disappointed. Update - I am an avid Prevue cage consumer and this is my FOURTH Prevue cage to purchase. This time I had considerable difficulties in getting a \"complete cage\" delivered.  Only box 2 of the 2-box set arrived and box 1 never arrived.  I had to have several conversations with customer service to get satisfaction in having another shipment sent so I could get a complete cage!  I was quite disgusted in hearing customer service state that the other box was still showing to be delivered on the date specified.  But it never arrived.  Finally, after several days of waiting in anticipation and a newly-shipped parrot waiting in a tiny holding box, the complete cage 2-box set finally arrived!  Many days late...so I am not a happy buyer with this purchase.  Also, one leg of the front panel was bent and I had great difficulty getting it straightened so the roller would fit it.  Several pieces of the channeling where the cage panels slide in were bent up also.  Some broke off.  So my cage seems rather unstable.  I am really not happy with this transaction!  The only consolation is that my new \"traumatized\" parrot finally has a cage to settle in.  I would have given this only two stars, but Prevue is such a great product, generally, that I added one more star.  I am sad about that aspect as I have always given Prevue cage orders 5 stars! We purchased this when we got our second bird-- a quaker-- we got the 24x20 size in sage.  The color is a TINY bit more blue-green and darker than it looks in the bright photo, but it's still beautiful. It's PERFECT.  So easy to assemble, sturdy, easy to clean.  I have zero criticism or complaints.  Neither does my bird.  Haha.  Loves the play top. I was a little worried about putting this together all by myself but I did it. I used both hands to pat myself on the back after completion. Be sure to measure your door frame before putting the seed/poop guard on the bottom because had I put it on before hand I would\u2019ve not got it in the room. Could of used an extra hand a couple times but nothing I couldn\u2019t figure out on my own. After reading all the negative reviews I was sceptical about ordering but I already have one Preview cage that I love. I have two tiels who love this cage. It fits many toys and perches. Its not the widest cage but it is very tall and my birds do love making use of that. I'm very happy with this purchase..its extremely sturdy and the top playgroud area is a huge plus! The seeds still get all over the floor despite the seed catchers but thats to be expected with these messy little eaters. However, the poop stays IN the cage so thats great! The wheels are perfect for me as I love to rearrange the cage depending on the lighting inside. There is a small latch door for easy access to changing the food bowls out. And the two poo trays are extremely easy to remove and clean. I was actually sent a small vial of matching paint incase there were any scratches upon delivery or it needs a touch up which I thought was extremely sweet. The maker of this cage really thought of everything with this and must have birds of their own! This cage is a must! This cage is pretty nice. I downsized to this cage due to the original cage I had purchased was for a large parrot. This cage was easy to put together. I was able to complete it alone with any help. I had to cut the perch down that came with the cage due to being about 3 inches too long for the cage. I think for the cage is priced well. I saw Petsmart now carries the same cage for $220 and I wouldn't pay that much for this cage. I am a bargain hunter though! I had alot of toys to due to having a larger cage, so I had to get creative with them! Really nice quality for this price range - I am impressed.  Packaging was very good too and no major issues with the cage were encountered upon opening the box and removing the various pieces.  Assembly took about 30 minutes or so and was pretty straightforward.  Overall I can recommend this cage based on my personal experience with it.  One thing that has me scratching my head is that I received a different color cage than what I had ordered.  Luckily, the color I received was acceptable and worked with our decor, otherwise I would have had a headache returning it. ", "We bought this as a temporary cage for those times we want our conure to hang out downstairs. We have a large Prevue cage already and we're happy with the quality, finish and design so we decided to stick with the brand instead of some off-brand that is cheaper. LoVe, LoVe It!!! But better yet so does ZoE our Sun Conure, and which is the perfect size for her, lots and lots of room. She was the runt but would be great for any birds conure size. Great quality and looks great, not to mention all the different colors to match every decor. (we got the coco)  Easy, easy to put together, we only had one little hick-up. That was when we put the top on and didn't take notice that the sides having little tabs on the top that fit into top holes. We just couldn't figure out why top would not fit right, but once we figured it out it was all good.. All our fault! Only down side you will have to buy new better perches for inside, it only comes with one, and its an awful fit. Branch perches are much better for their feet. I would like longer legs, or optional extenders, so my bird is at eye level and I don't have to bend down to talk or put things in the cage. I would prefer cups on the front beside the door, not on the side. The cup door latches are tricky to open ( should be able to use one hand) and should have a means ( bar? clip? ) to prevent the bird from dumping seed and water cups. I don't use the top playpen but it is ok for someone who can leave the bird out without supervision.  Don't use the seed catchers because they make the cage too wide for doorways.  It's a well built cage, moves easily and sized perfectly to line with newspaper.  And space deep enough so the bird can't reach the paper or tear it. All in all a decent cage but needs a few tweeks to be great. Love love Love! I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews where people received damaged parts or did not receive parts. The cage arrived and when I opened the box, nothing was missing or damaged. While it says it's best to have two people assemble, I did it by myself and it took about 45 minutes. It's sturdy and I love how smooth the caster wheels are, they are sturdy compared to my prior cage. I got this for a green cheek conure and it's the perfect size! He already loves the play top. I added a picture so you can see the scale... I live in Hawaii so my cage options were pretty limited since not many ship here but I came across this one that would ship and crossed my fingers. It arrived quickly and had a slight dent from shipping although I didn't deduct stars for that reason since it's fairly common to receive damaged items when you live all the way in Hawaii so its something I have come to terms with. It was easy enough for me to put together myself although there are a couple building steps that would be easier with two people. it rolls smoothly and I like the design of it. I use the bottom drawer as a storage for my sun conure's food and toys and lined the bottom level above it so it would stay clean in the drawer. Overall the cage is pretty great for the price and pretty sturdy. The cons however are this, the seed catcher on the outside sticks out pretty far (but you can leave it off) and the seams where it meets the cage isn't sealed completely so some tiny seeds or liquidy poops can fall through, I solved this by just taping over them with masking tape. The food and water holders are where the biggest design flaw is. They are located and meant to be hung directly in front of the side doors, this may be so you can swing it open to pull out the dishes to clean them however the execution was pretty bad. The wire holder wouldn't fit in the holes they have because they have another bar in the way so the fit is too tight to fit the bowls so I had to make it half in half out but if I open the doors they lose support and fall forward, in one instance that resulted in spilling most of my bird's water, I no longer open those doors but could always just buy another food and water dish that attaches to the cage. The only other negative was that the front lock is a spring loaded button so when you press it it flys open making a clanging noise, the first few times it scared my bird but he's gotten used to it, it also has a small metal piece that swings/hangs down to prevent the door from opening if the lock gets unlocked. If you have an extra smart bird/escape artist this might be too easy for them to get out of although I'm sure there are ways to rig it. Product came before date stated. The packaging Had some minor damage on it, but it did not affect the overall product. This particular product came into boxes. The package was quite heavy, but the FedEx person help me to carry it into my house. It took me approximately an hour and 1/2 to put the cage together. I am a 63-year-old female, and if I can do it, anyone can! I googled YouTube and assembling the Prevue birdcage. This was very helpful. Using only the equipment supplied, made it very easy. We have a 25-year-old Lilac Crowned Amazon, that lived with us 19 years ago. Due to the new owners having to downsize and move into a condo, they weren't able to take the bird with them. The cage that she was in, was quite small. We were very anxious to get a larger cage for her. After reading many of the other reviews, we decided this would be the right choice for her and for us. Pokey, went into the cage with very little resistance. She is very happy with her much-needed space and new toys! I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested, and if I ever needed a new, one would buy it once again. Great quality cage. Came in before expected arrival time. Fairly easy to assembly. You'd probably need to be in elementary school to not be able to put one of these together, even without instructions. Took off one star only because there was a slight curve in one of the panels, but once I put it together it was a non issue. Also the seed catchers were really bent out pf shape that I would imagine it would be really hard to assemble them and even if assembled, would probably look very mangled, but I didn't use the seed catchers anyway. It took up too much space and it's not much to just sweep around the cage every few hours. Plus, it came with a note from the manufacturer saying that if there were parts that were damaged in shipment, there is no need to ship them back, and they will send a replacement part. All you need to do is call. I figured since, I didn't need the bent seed catchers, why bother and the slight curve in one of the panels worked it self out anyways. So no harm no foul. This is my first bird cage purchase and I must say, I am quite impressed with the cage itself and the overall quality (considering I had to assemble it myself and every other instruction stated, \"this step will be easier when performed by 2 people\" lol). Assembly was not too bad for just 1 person and I absolutely LOVE the guard/skirt around the bottom. Both the top play area and the bottom catch area are very easy to access and clean as well as the water & food cups. They can be removed without ever actually opening the cage from the front / less disruption and again, very EASY! I ordered and received a play top bird cage (#3151).  I am not at all happy with the quality of the product.  First, the color is MUCH darker than the pictures depict.  Second, the cage has several poor quality welds and the thick iron frame bars were bent in places.  The bolt holes were welded in out of place and I cannot even finish securing the roof to the cage.  The grille clip appears to be of poor design and the wrong size because it does not secure the grille and damages the paint when used as depicted in the instruction manual.  There are more poor welds preventing the play top support structure from being assembled.  Or it may be someone\u2019s mistake in AutoCAD designing it because the round Part 2.1 most certainly does NOT fit into square Part 2.2.  All of this I discovered after spending some time carefully wiping down and cleaning each piece in preparation for my birds.  I am very happy with the ceramic dishes I ordered to fit in the cage and the instruction manual is better than I expected for something made in China (although some of it is printed upside-down).  The seed skirt is a nice design.  If I did not have the above issues, it would make an excellent cockatiel or green cheek conure cage.  I bought it as a second, sleeping cage for my GCC and Sun Conure.  I\u2019m looking to replace their larger, primary cage and I think I\u2019m going to go with the pricier A&E cages. Great cage, came packaged well with outer corner protectors, inside was wrapped in bubble wrap, zip ties and cardboard and Styrofoam went together pretty well some bolts on the top part didn't line up well but I was able to get them in on a slight angle with patients however they were not too far off where I could not get them in, just do it slow until the thread catches and slowly screw in. The wooden perches smelled funky like chemicals so wash them, don't submerge. In fact I would recommend Washing everything before you put birds in it and give it a feel down inside to make sure their are no sharp edges or snaggs in the metal. The only issue I have is the ladder is about 1-1.25 in too long to put in the top play area I can only guess that the ladder was meant for a bigger cage and was accidentally placed with this one. I love that it came with touch up paint and small paint brush, thank you for that. I know it's almost impossible to have a perfect item come through shipping without a small dent or scratch so like the instructions state have some needle nose pliers handy to tweak the dents, I would place a rubber grippy over the metal you intend to reshape to protect the paint from scratching, but like I said it came with touch up paint. All in all our cockatiel is happy it's not a bulky cage, great for smaller apartment and it will fit the net type seed catcher if you decide to not use the one provided with the cage. I would show a pic of the ladder but for some reason amazon does not give me that option with every review???? I recommend this cage! ", "This cage does NOT keep seeds off the floor. I have had this for over 1 year and has never worked. I thought this would help keep them off the floor so my 2 year old wouldn't put seeds in her mouth or anywhere else. (Her nose) well did  no good. Just a waste of money if it's purpose was for keeping the seeds in the cage. Cause she ended up constantly picking up the seeds off the floor. Putting them in her nose. I have no other choice to sweep still after buying this more than 2x a day. He's a green cheek conure and he is messy. That's why we got it. I'm so upset my husband spends so much money to promise that the seeds will stop ending up on the floor from very little to none. Ya right. Not worth it sorry. The tray has the holes to insert the tray in and they are pretty big and not snug into the cage. So they fall out of there when the seeds fall in. What's the point? I posted a pic of the gigantic holes. I am so upset with this purchase.  I purchased this cage to replace/upgrade from a Vision cage with failing clips.  I was really looking forward to getting my birds in a new setup with a play top.  My husband hauled the heavy box upstairs and I started assembing it.  The design seems decent and instructions fine.  I have had birds my entire life and have set up large cages for other birds. I didn\u2019t get very far before realizing there is a manufacturing defect with the cage delivered to me - there are metal shards sticking out from some of the bars of the cage.  Obviously birds slide their beaks and feet along bars and this could be extremely dangerous.  Returning this cage and wish it had worked out differently. I was worried about the negative reviews of this cage, however I found most of their claims baseless (at least in my experience). I ordered a pewter cage and received a sage one but no matter. I ordered the 24\" wide one for my grey parrot. It arrived packaged well but had a few dings and chips in the paint regardless but you also get a small brush and bottle of touch up paint for that. I purchased 2 of these cages to house my greencheek conure and 2 parakeets. They arrived quickly with prime shipping and in perfect condition, packaged very well. Assembly instructions were easy to follow. Cages came with all the hardware and a hex wrench to assemble. No other tools required. It took about 15 minutes each and they went together smoothly. All holes were aligned. No dents in the seed catchers. They even came with a little jar of touch-up paint and a brush, although it wasn't needed. All that was required was for us to add toys and our birds! They're very happy! I think this is as fine a cage you can get for the money. We have a 20 year old African Grey and he loves it. We just move in a new house and still had the cage we bought when we got him. I was worried about how he would react moving to a new house and a new cage but he's very happy. He likes the play area and I like how easy the tray is to change. I had no problems with assembly. I'm pleased with the purchase but the best thing is our bird is pleased. It\u2019s sad when we buy a product for our beloved pets and find out safety isn\u2019t the manufacturer priority. After only 3 months I can see rust in the bowls. Sad. Birds are very sensitive and rust can kill them. Don\u2019t tell the customer you\u2019re product is made of stainless steel when it\u2019s not or just \u201cbathed\u201d in stainless steel. Wish me luck finding real safe bowls that will fit inside the bowl holder rack. The tray around cage leaves a gap around it, seeds fall on the floor regardless. I recently bought this cage because my lovebirds needed an upgrade. I was looking for specific qualities and spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect cage; I expected to spend at least $300. When I first discovered this cage, it was actually in a pet store and would have cost around $250+ but after comparing on Amazon, my boyfriend convinced me to buy this one instead & I saved over $100, which of course was wonderful. Love the color and it was so easy to put together. It isn't all the easy to clean but I'll do my best... This is exactly what I expected, from it's description. The color was exactly as shown,  the teal or green vintage color, we love it. ", "I bought this cage for my Senegal (I know, it's a mansion) because I work part-time, and I didn't like the idea of him without room to play when he had to be caged. Firstly, I'm 5'4\", and I put the whole cage together. Myself. An incredible feat, I know. Once built, the cage itself ends at about my chin, which means I have a full view of the top/play area. The perch, however, is just slightly above my head, so if you're short and have a bird who gets all power-drunk when in a high position, you may want to rethink using the top perch. Otherwise, the cage was fairly easy to assemble (the side panel was a little bowed, so I had to wrestle it in, but I don't see that being a problem). I've had him in the cage for a few months, and my little guy could NOT be happier! Overall this is a good cage for the price. I got it for my lovebird, and it's a great size for her. Lovebirds are very active and she has plenty of room to hop around and spread her wings a little. My complaints would be the bar coating is kind of cheap and I'm unable to get one of the bowl holders on the playstand into the holes because of a shoddy soldering job. Being that this is actually a good size for a small to medium bird, the bars around the door, top, etc, are so wide my bird can't actually get her beak around them so out of cage time is a bit awkward. I have to rig it up for her to come out, she's still being hand tamed, etc. The playstand won't fully screw down so it's a little slanted forward. The bowls are gigantic, but I have her smaller bowls sitting inside them. And last, the seed guard doesn't attach very tightly and definitely stuff falls through to the floor when I brush the edges into the bottom. I wanted a floor cage because my cats can't knock it over, and this is decent, but I definitely expected a little better quality of Prevue. This cage is huge! My African Grey loves the room. The price is great compared to most cages of this size which are priced well over $500, most over $700. I was worried she would not like this cage sine she has lived in a dome-top cages all of her life. I usually replace my birds cages every 2-4 years depending on the condition (if there is any chipped paint, signs of rust starting, etc), so I have many different brands and types between all the birds I have and have had throughout my life. Keep in mind, I have only had these cages (Prevue 3151C, 3152C, and 3154C) for only a short time, but my birds and I are very happy. The 3154C (36x24 inch) cage is huge. I would think this cage could easily house a larger bird then my Congo African Grey. The cage is very solid and heavy weight, much heavier then her previous cages. The caster wheels are much nicer then what her other cage had which were plastic. I only ran into one problem. This cage, 3154C, came with a defective side fame (one of the holes was punched 1 inch off and the side panel could not slip into it correctly). I first contacted Prevue, as instructed by the insert, which would have probably worked out but would have taken longer to replace since the cage was directly purchased from them, I would have need to send them a copy of the purchase receipt and all my information before helping me to fix this. So I called Amazon customer service (or actually asked for them to call me, just follow the instructions under the \"Help\" link and \"Contact Us\" instructions. The Amazon customer service rep was wonderful. He contacted Prevue and gave them all my information and then gave me a direct extension number to talk to the Prevue representative that would handle replacing the part at no charge (for the part or shipping). The part was sent out right away. However, it did take a week for me to receive it but that was due to the distance and since the part was covered under their warranty (according to the Prevue rep) they could not rush it even when I offered to pay the difference. No worries though...the part arrived and I was able to get it all together in about 30 minutes, if that.  THANK YOU AMAZON - YOU ARE THE BEST !!! I ordered this cage for my green cheek conure. Great cage for the price. Size: is a perfect upgrade for him. He has plenty of room to climb around and play...it may even be a tad too spacious for him, if that is even possible. Although with birds you can never give them too big of an enclosure, as they will make use of whatever space you give them. Bird type: sise-wise I would say this cage is perfect for a parakeet or two, a cockatiel, a small to medium conure...(basically any small to medium sized bird), but make sure you check the dimensions before you order as there are a few options to buy. Quality/Design: very sturdy cage, great locking mechanism, coating makes it easy to clean. Bars are thicker and not flexible like other cheap cages. I like how far the catch tray is from the top of the cage because your bird cannot reach the bottom to eat gross, dropped seeds. The top of the cage is a perch/playtop with a removable catch tray, and my bird loves to sit up there (once he got used to it.) There are two mounts inside the cage for the included stainless steel bowls. What is really convienant is that the bowls are attached to their own separate, locking doors for easy access from the outside of the cage. (Ie: you don\u2019t have to open the main door to get to them.) It also comes with two stainless bowls for the playtop perch. The metal seed guard is removable and I haven\u2019t used it much...but it seems to work okay when I do have it on. However the cage won\u2019t fit through doorways when the seed guard is on lol. It also won\u2019t work if your bird flings seeds horizontally haha. Anyway, another great thing about this cage is the wheels, they are kind of like shopping cart wheels but they do the job. It\u2019s nice to be able to move the cage easily to clean and move him around the house. Overall I think it is an awesome cage for the price and definitely better than most cheaper store bought cages. It is worth the extra few bucks to have a cage that will last, is easy to clean, and will not rust. My last $60 cage was a p.o.s. after a few years. Assembly: It took a little work to put together but it is mostly intuitive. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to put together if you\u2019re a least a tad handy. All the needed tools and screws are included. The only downside I see were the few slight defects where there were tiny parts on a bar where paint was missing, but they do include a touch up paint in the box. Definitely worth the purchase, especially when it is on sale! First Amazon again great accommodations with shipping expidite you really are customer focused. The cage read reviews and so many models and to be honest not sure if the price point was the best but at least competitive and big box stores don\u2019t carry. Being torn between the top 3 manufacturers in this size it was a toss of a coin and in the end this proved to standby my expectations easy to setup larger or should I say roomer than my older one great color goes with my decor the black blends in nice with my mahogany couch and fireplace as it\u2019s has hints of chocolate at least with my eyes \ud83d\ude0e instructions were good easy to follow 30 minutes end to end done. Suggest having a RUBBER mallet for the feet install and even play pen needs some love to put in but expected given the material. Highly recommend my white cockatiel loves it some complained about birds having issue getting from cage to top by them self\u2019s mine it took coaching but once he figure out boom no issue if you see one with yours buy a small Woden ladder lay side ways to rear on top fasten in with tie straps and your bird should be able to navigate fine I purchased the 24\u00d720\u00d760 for my Green Cheek conure. I had purchased the 18\u00d718 for my love birds a year ago so I knew that the quality of the cage was good....however that cage had some defects so I was worried about the new one. The 24\u00d720\u00d760 is the perfect size for my conure. It's an upgrade from the small cage that came with her anyway. The cage itself is still a good quality but it has a few defects as well. The ladder is too long for the top so it pushed on the braces that supports the perch backwards in turn bending the grates below the tray. I'm not sure what happened during manufacturing or if I got a returned one and the replaced just the ladder with the wrong one. But the whole reason I bought this cage was for the top play gym so I'm dissapointed in that part.  The 18\u00d718 cage had spaces on the back that weren't the bar spacing of the rest of the cage and I had to place plastic mesh material over it to keep the love birds from getting their heads stuck. The new cage I don't have that problem with so that was plus. It took a long time to get the holes to line up, and some beating because nothing lined up correctly. Other than that it's a nice cage, good quality, and it's sturdy. They did send me some paint stuff with the new cage, not exactly what that was for and it's not in the directions. I assume it's for color correction if something happens. I'm not sure what Amazon has done with the contact seller button but it's not longer there, just the return option. So I guess I have to live with a bent play gym at the top. Bought 2 of these - one for upstairs and one for down. Very pretty aesthetically - compliments any room. Only complaint is I wish the water and food weren't so close together. My cockatiel has mastered dumping his shells in his water! Next I get to figure out how to clean it - not sure if it'll fit through the bathroom door with the skirt thingy on it. I wish it had a place to store the upper tray, underneath the bottom tray - so it's more open and sunny in the cage if you want it to be. The metal on the skirt is really soft - can't push on it to move the cage without bending it. I'm just careful and it's all good. Overall, I'm very happy with this cage and so is my fine feathered friend! I have to give this cage, Prevue 3151C, 5 out of 5 stars even though I can not use it. It was a breeze to assemble, very sturdy and solid cage and arrived in perfect condition (great job on the packaging). I absolutely love these cages (I have three now). However, I have only had them for a few weeks now. Warning about the size of the 3151 (18X18 Inch) size: I made a mistake in choosing this size for my Sun Conure. I read all the reviews prior to choosing this size and thought it would be ok for her but I was wrong. My Sun Conure is an older bird and is not as active as she use to be, so I did not think she would have a problem downsizing from her much larger cage. I was wrong. Either she is large for a Sun Conure, or other have smaller Suns. By the time I put all her toys and most importantly her bed (Happy Hut), there was barely enough room for her. I rushed when I purchased this cage, because of the great sale price, and for some reason, the next size was over $150 more at the time when the others differed only approx. $50 between sizes. Anyway, I learned I needed to be patient because only a week after I received this cage, 3151C, the next size, 3152C, lowered it's price more than $60. Just my luck. So after a another week, I gave in and ordered the 3152C. Wow, what a difference! So I have to say, in my opinion the 3151C (18X18 inch) cage is much too small for a Sun Conure. I am not sure about a large Cockatiel or other Conure. Now that the sale price has been lowered on the next large size, why not just spend the little difference, I am sure your bird will appreciate it. The only reason I am giving this product 3 stars is because the cage itself is pretty good. Went together easy until I got to the top. The perch for the playstand was missing. Never came in the box. I contacted Plum Struck they offered me a refund if I took the cage apart and sent it back. Anyone who puts together a big bird cage knows what this is like! From looking at the package, you can tell it was a return item. Previously opened and taped up. So many damaged pieces inside. I spent 2 hours bending & straightening pieces of the cage. The pictures speak for themselves. I could add numerous more. I was lucky to have a complete, but wobbly, bird cage. I couldn't return because the box was already torn. ", "This is the best cage that I have had.  My short time experience with it has been wonderful.  My parrot has lots of room and is very content.  I now can leave the door open 24-7 and my bird can climb around outside and inside and be on the play station on top.  I have hung a toy on either side of the top perch and the freedom my parrot has and enjoys is fun to watch.  Tequila has just discovered the handle on the pull out drawer for the play station and likes to sit on the top of the door and mouth the handle.  My parrot also likes to go around on top of the seed catcher and take a tour all the way around. I read almost all of the reviews on this cage before ordering.  I was struggling to determine the right size for our pet cockatiel we are waiting on and was a little worried the cage might arrive damaged or be hard to assemble.  The cage arrived on time and packaged well, the corners were even reinforced with extra packaging.  All pieces arrived in perfect condition.  We ordered the \"sage green\" color and it is beautiful.  My husband assembled the cage by himself in about 20 mins.  All pieces fit and were not bent nor did they need additional holes punctured as I saw in other reviews.  Having the pull out trays will be amazing for clean up.  I will come back and add to this once our baby is ready to bring home, but I am sure the bird will love this cage as much as we do! I bought one of these cages about 7 years ago and I loved it!!!  I just got a new bird in July 2016 so I decided to purchase it again since I was REALLY happy with the first one.  I found this one on AMAZON and this had to come from the \"reject\" bin.  It came with 2 missing Perch's, 2 missing dishes, AND the \"food/dirt catcher\" was missing 2 panels.  The last thing was the door for the cage don't shut right...  I can't close it with one hand because of the imperfection.  I was able to get by and buy an extra perch and food dishes.. but with the 2 panels missing it makes it very easy for my bird to make a mess....  If this company is going to sell their products for discount because they are messed up... then they should tell you that in the description.  If I didn't have another cage made by them then I wouldn't have anything to compare it to!!  I contacted the company and they sent me everything that was messed up....  If the cage was perfect like the first one it would have gotten 5 stars!! I own several Prevue cages and have never been disappointed. I bought the 24\" one for my Caique in November 2019. It's a bit snug since he's so active, so I just purchased the 36\" one for him that should arrive this weekend. This will be his sleeping cage instead. I opted not to use the top tray, I attached a twisted rope perch instead and attached toys - he loves it! I also didn't bother with the seed guards. This cage only had one quality issue, one bar was slightly bent, making it difficult to attach the top. I just used some leverage with the wrench to bend it back enough to fit right. I was able to assemble it alone. Very sturdy! Overall I liked the product. I use it for my green cheek Conure. It's easy to assemble except the last part \"the shield\" was hard to attached. It's easy to clean. There was a strong paint smell. it stayed about one week. I think it's better to wait at least week before you put your bird in. Beautiful cage!  The bird cage came undamaged and was easy to set up.  My cockteil loves his new cage!  I thought he might miss his old cage since he had when he was a baby, but he doesn't want anything to do with it now!  The cage is well built and sturdy.  I looks like the cage is very expensive but I bought it here on Amazon for very little money.  Its a bargain! arrived in herendous condition, bent here, bent there. Was packaged like it was a return. So, I called Amazon who were very willing to take it back but also offered $96 refund. So, I took the refund and my husband and I were able to make the repairs with some J.B. Weld and L brackets, we are now good to go. Cage went together pretty easily. I've purchased several bird cages through the years, this one is average at best. Commercial quality cage.  Very heavy and sturdy.  My only complaint is the color and the assembly.  I would prefer the color to be a solid black.  The black hammer tone is actually a dark grey with silver speckles. We purchased this cage for our new arrival - a cockatiel. Fortunately, we ordered it well in advance of our 'tiel showing up, as the first one we received was damaged. When assembling, the bottom portion has tabs that lock into the legs. Well, one of those tabs was missing, so the bottom portion would not sit into place. So we contacted Amazon, who sent a replacement cage, and we returned the damaged one (at no cost to us, other than time). Although I returned it, I thought this was a really nice cage. Good quality. A trusted brand at an unbeatable price. I liked how the door opened flush and it has a big opening. Also the way the playtop section attaches to the cage better than the a&e which only has a grate that sits on top and then you slide the pan on top of that. Not sure what prevents a bird from pushing up on it and having it fall on their head. Anyways this one is designed best. You don\u2019t have to attach the the bowls, perch and ladder to the playtop which is nice because mine wants no part of that. You also don\u2019t have to attach the seed guard. Another plus is that it comes with a paint brush and a little vial of touch up paint for future knicks and scratches. The only reason I returned it was due to the fact that it was too high. I planned on cutting down the legs but it was still too high. My bird has been in the same spot for most of her 30yrs and the cage just fits there. If it\u2019s too high she can reach the light switch. ", "I love these cages, so far (I have only had the first one for a few weeks now). My birds love them, although they are still afraid on going on the playtop, since they have only had dometop cages prior to these. The cage was easy to assemble, especially after viewing the YouTube video on the assembly of these model cages. I highly recommend viewing this video. It took me maybe 10 minutes to assemble it. It probably helped that I had previous experience after assembling two others just days before. Removing the cage parts from the boxes takes the most time. The packaging was as good as could be done, considering the size and weight of these cages. Unfortunately due the weight of the cage, there were some places in the box the cage pushed through, but no serious damage (just had to bend back one of the u-clips that pushed through the box). These cages are heavy and seem to be built well. This cage, 3152C, was the perfect size for my Sun Conure. I originally had ordered the smaller cage, 3151C (18x18 inch), after reading the reviews regarding the types of birds the cage was for, plus the fact the difference in price for the next size was so much more. I suppose it could have been ok for my Sun Conure but after placing her Happy Hut bed in and a couple toys, it was too crowded to fit her swing inside. I should know better. I like to spoil all my fur and feathered babies, so it really started to bother me after a few days of seeing her in the smaller cage. Luckly for her and me, this cage (3152C) was marked down even more, making it more reasonable compared to the other sizes....so of course, I ordered it. The cage arrived in 2 days, having Amazon Prime. I was a little concerned when the delivery expected date changed to 5 days later, but it arrived on the original date (2 days) anyway. Unfortunately, I had now wasted the money on the smaller cage, which would have been avoided if I had just sucked it up and paid the higher price for this model in the first place, or it would have been great if the sale price of this cage was adjusted before I ordered the smaller size cage. Oh well...live and learn. This review is based only on initial impressions after putting together the cage; however, the most important aspects of it, which are quality of paint, its protection against rust and damage from bird excrement will have to wait for quite a while. The other points to look for in the long term are weld spots and joints of the components. This is a great cage and I definitely recommend it for any conure or cockatiel parents. I have my Green Cheek Conure in the 18x18x57 cage and it is perfect for her. She climbs in, out and all over her cage all day long. There's ample space for toys and perches. Be advised the perches that come with the cage are not of the best quality and there are some manufacturer errors in the design such as bent metal in certain places (which makes putting the cage together a bit of a task). Other than that I definitely plan on purchasing another Prevue Bird Cage when we decide to add another feathered friend to the family. Cage arrived and all was in good shape.  I found it very easy to assemble and did so by myself.  The only part I didn't like was the lack of bars on top to hang toys from top of cage.  The cage is on the dark side due to the playground on top.  My bird is visually impaired so for me this is a non issue.  I needed a cage that she could easily exit with a perch on top and needed the cage to be protected from bird droppings.  My bird can easily maneuver out and onto the top of the cage.  The cage seems like it will be very easy to clean which is important to me.  I purchased different perches of varying sizes and placed them strategically in the cage. Beautiful cage!  I ordered the red and it is a very deep burgundy.  It looks very nice and I can't wait to introduce my bird to the cage.  The instructions were well done and in English.  Most of the parts just slide into place.  There are a few screws and extra screws were included for convenience.  Everything fit where it was supposed to.  It was a little tricky putting the seed catcher together until I realized that the seems go on the outside.  The little hook to keep the bottom grate in place fit easily once I figured out how to put it on- you slip the 2 hooks over the lower bar and the longer bar/hook over the handle.  The box for the first cage was totally bent and banged up.  I didn't even open it.  I contacted Amazon and they took it right back and packaged the 2nd box with corner protectors.  Nothing was bent and the parts fit together perfectly.  This was a terrific purchase and a great price!!! I placed a deposit on an African Grey baby and I had 8 weeks to find her new home. I researched bird cages everywhere I could. I not only went to stores that sold cages, I went to bird vets and breeders to see what brands and types they used. Since the cage brand is not listed in the amazon discription I really had no way to compare apples to apples. What I found was the cage listed in the ad is a Prevue brand. Prevue Hendryx is a very high quality cage that is offered by brand name on several websites for $500-$700 and as much as $899 in pet stores. I found this very brand being used by some of the professionals places of business I spoke of. ($329 + $18 shipping was the best price anywhere, no one else came close) Great home for my soon to arrive Sun Conure.  Assembly was a breeze and fun.  The cage is nicely constructed. I left the 'catchers' off since online video reviews state that such devices tend to collect moist seeds which causes cleaning issues.  I will be making a cage (sides) cover using three washable side curtains with grommets which will  hang on heavy duty magnetic hooks (the top play area prevents conventional cage covers from being used). I opted for the Prevue cage over the  \"Big Deal\" cage, which is similar to this one, because the \"Big Deal\" cage has the big gap for roaming birds to gain access to the yucky tray below. I had very high expectations from all the reviews, but I was disappointed once I unboxed the package. There was no damage to the box from shipping, but I could clearly hear metal peices moving inside the box which was concerning. There were multiple parts that were bent, some of the welds were not even, the wood perches looked like they were starting to rot, and the pewter color I chose did not match the photos. As a large piece of furniture in my living room, I could not settle for something with so many imperfections as it would bother me on a day to day basis. After assembling the cage, I decided to return it and taking the cage apart and repackaging everything proved to be very time consuming and difficult. However, if everything arrived in good condition, this would make an excellent bird habitat. Upon opening this package, the first thing I noticed was a strong odor, not sure what it is but anyone who has parrots knows that odors can be hazardous, so I knew I couldn't put my bird in the cage for awhile until the odor dissipated. Next, I found  there were no instructions or paperwork whatsoever about the cage or how to assemble it.  Upon further opening it, I discovered half the parts were missing, there is supposed to be 4 food dishes, there was not, there was supposed to be 4 brackets to attach the dish holders with and there was not. One side panel was very warped.  Some of the screw holes were not punched all the way through.  Finally, I noticed RUST, yes RUST at half a dozen of the solder connections on the inside of the cage. Another hazard for parrots. The service at Amazon in responding to the issues was good, they are sending a replacement although I told them half an hour after they set that up that I do not want a replacement, the quality of this cage was so poor that I have no faith in the manufacturer (Prevue) to put out a decent cage and I will refuse the replacement.  I went to our local bird shop and paid the extra for a cage that was SAFE and sturdy.  I was sorely disappointed in this cage, apparently Prevue has declined a great deal in the last decade, I won't be buying any of their products anymore. Haven't found anything wrong with this product. Even though the instructions were not in clear English, they gave you plenty of screws, nuts, bolts and the cage is pretty much easy to put together (Even for a dummy like me!) I got it together in 15 minutes. The play gym is AWESOME. My birds love it, however some birds may not be thrilled with a covering (at the top of their cage). I use this for my midsized (greencheek conure) and he has lots of room. This is great for birds who like vertical surfaces (Lovebirds, conures, cockatiels, etc) It was way to small a cage for my amazon parrot. Prevue has always put out some great products and this one doesn't disappoint. Although it says \"Parrot\" cage, it can be very narrow, so I wouldn't recommend it for anything bigger than a conure or quaker (Maybe a ringneck) ", "We have had this same model of cage purchased many different times.  Unfortunately, we have one that came from the MANUFACTURER with a defective weld.  It would not hold one of the bottom parts in the cage properly .  This is the FIRST time we have had an issue with this manufacturer, so I hope between this and the replacement, I can get a good working bird cage together. My sun conure loves his new cage, and I like how easy it is to move the cage around. I can easily roll him back and forth between rooms and keep his cage door open so he can go out/in as he pleases. The playtop is nice and the litter trays and food dishes are easy to remove and clean. Overall it is a great value cage and would give 5 stars, but I have one complaint: I purchased this cage for my Green Cheek Conure.  He is only a baby at 10 weeks old, but I wanted a nice big cage for him.  I think this cage would comfortably fit 2 green cheek conures or 2 slightly bigger birds (Sun Conure).  Definitely not a cage for an adult African Grey or larger parrot.  The largest bird(s) I would place in this cage is a Caique or a pair of them. I spoiled my lovebird a bit and got him a cage that is twice the size of the average lovebird enclosure. He loves it, and can spread his wings and jump place to place. The seed catcher is also super effecting at its job. I wasn't expecting a lot from this cage, given the price and that it had to be assembled. I was expecting something much flimsier, with ill-fitting connections. I was pleasantly surprised. It is heavy enough that a large bird would have difficulty bending the bars (if they were able to at all). It fits together nicely, is easy to operate once you figure out the door latches for the main door and the food and water trays, and wasn't too difficult to assemble. The biggest problem was poor instructions - you could figure out more looking at the picture on Amazon and the Prevue page. I am very pleased with the assembled product, though, and expect to use it for a long time. All the reviews were dead on.  Difficult to put together and holes don't line up.  Dented in place and needed to be touched up with the paint they send with it but still a great design and value.  I bought for my green cheek and once the toys were in, it was a tight space (18x18) so I found another one just like this one (used on Craigslist and put together) and got that as well.  The one that I bought here on amazon is a secondary cage that I use now if I want to move my bird in to a diffent room but again I feel it is too small, even for my little conure, to have it be her full time cage.  Get your little feathered friend the biggest cage your space will hold.  I cannot stress enough that then18x18 is very small.  My conure is a small bird and I would never leave her in there full time.  She is the size of a cockatiel.  The 24 inch cage is perfect for her. We started using this cage in October 2019 and it is now unusable because of the rust. It comes with a very thin amount of powder coating and a little tiny bottle of paint to touch it up. We used all the paint on the thin spots and still with just normal cleaning it is now unusable. We figured the poor quality is due to the fact that it was made in China. I bought this cage to replace one that was far too large for my 2 pet cockatiels. The size of this cage was not only just right for them, but also fits much more easily into the small space I have in my apartment. I looked for awhile for a suitable bird cage for our newly adopted cockatiel. I had an older cage I used for cockatiels I had in the past but it was starting to rust pretty badly. The pet stores had cages around the same price but were flimsy. I wanted something sturdy that my cats wouldn't knock down. When I got this cage it was packed very nicely (no damage at all). The instructions were very simple and easy to understand but after peeking at the instructions I didn't even really use it. It only took 15-20 minutes to put it together. It is very sturdy and nicely weighted. The bar spacing is a not too wide and our cockatiel, Remy, climbs the bars just fine. It has a lot of nice features, including a nice lock for the big cage door, removable trays and wire bottom for easy cleaning, casters for easy maneuvering, seed guard, and a nice playtop. Height wise it hits me at about nose level (I am 5'6\"). Just one side note, I got black but it's more pewter colored but still looks great! I do like how they give you touch up paint just in case but haven't had to use it yet. So happy I decided on this cage! I did not have the problems with bad welds or poor packaging that some other reviewers have had. ", "Lol I never build anything. And I put this together, lol I was so proud. Maybe it is just easy haha. Built in under an hour, and super white. Mine had a few bends and dings but I managed to make it fit. I have one cockatiel in there she can spread her wings. But I would definitely say this is the minimum size. I let her out quite a lot. Other reviewers comments about assembly were our experience too - directions were not the most detailed and I am not mechanically inclined. We had our contractor assemble the birdcage as he was doing some remodeling for us, Love the bird cage and love the color. We were a little anxious how our African Gray parrot would take to his new home - we need not have worried. We decided ti leave the top tray off because 'Baby'  likes to travel upside down over the top part of the cage and wouldn't do it with the top on. Great size - a little larger than our original cage. Love the skirts around the sides that help catch the seeds. The new cage is much easier to clean. Nice touch how the food and water bowls have their own door.  Would definitely recommend this cage. I read the reviews before buying and took a chance with others reviews based on a good price for this cage. I think everyone who was missing hardware I got it lol. Lots of extra screws and nuts, directions kinda sucked but most do. I got this cage for my Goffin Cockatoo to have a day cage in my living room.  This cage is much smaller than his normal and sleeping cage, but it's still very large for him.  He loves it.  He watched me assemble it from his perch and was eager to test it out.  He has plenty of space to live and hang out in, but not really lots of space to flap his wings with hanging toys.  It has plenty of vertical space, I may get him another perch for the bottom of the cage so he can maybe be able to flap his wings.  The feeding bowls inside the cage are very deep.  The cage has a locking mechanism that prevents my bird from escaping so far without the need for industrial locks, but I usually keep an open cage policy when I'm around.  I should really knock off a star because the cage did come with a few bent areas and parts... but a vice-grip locking wrench was able to fix it to be functional. It's size would probably be fine for a main cage for a Goffin Cockatoo, but I think my birdie will prefer his resort sized cage more. This cage is sitting disassembled in my garage and ready to be taken to my community's bulky trash facility.  While it was a good size, it rusted fairly quickly and therefore was not a healthy environment for my parrot.  I hated knowing that her cage was substandard.  Save yourself some money and aggravation by buying a good quality cage from the start.  King's Cages, for example, has a much better level of quality control, and their service is responsive.  If you get this cage, set aside a few hours for assembly, because I agree with others who have noted it's a real pain to put together. So far so good. I would definitely recommend putting this together away from your bird. There is a pretty strong chemical/packaging smell from it right out of the box. The directions are relatively easy to follow and no special tools are required for assembly. The construction of the cage is pretty awesome. We had a hard time with the very top of the cage (the bottom of the playcenter) getting it to line up and fit correctly. We eventually got it. Just for a size reference...I stand 5'3\" and the perch on the very top is eye level with me. Its a pretty good sized cage for a GCC or smaller bird. So buying things online isn\u2019t always what you expect. We were a little skeptical about this product. Bought it and put it together. This product is great. Easy to assemble, very sturdy and seems to be of good quality and should last. If you\u2019re on the fence buy it. It\u2019s worth the extra money for a cage of this quality. I rarely take the time to type a review but I owed this company this because they did a nice job of putting this product together and getting it on the market. Very pleased. This may just be my birds, but they tend to like to be as high as possible. This cage has a lot of vertical space, but not much horizontal space. The bottom half of the cage pretty much never gets used. The birds pretty much all stay at the same level. I got this cage today and I couldn\u2019t be happier! Its extremely well made and sturdy! I have a conure in it and she loves it! Lots of room for her toys too!  I\u2019ve read a lot of reviews where  people say the cage arrived damaged or missing parts but my cage arrived very well packaged. The box had reinforced corners on the outside of it and all the parts inside the box were wrapped with bubble wrap.  Maybe the quality control has definitely gotten better on making sure these cages are packaged properly so they don\u2019t get damaged in transit. Definitely the best money I\u2019ve ever spent for a bird cage!! 2 Days to Hawaii!  Wow, can't beat that!  We are happy with this purchase, came in two days, and only minor issues to the packaging and or framing of the birdcage.  Packaging held up, but had two 2\"diameter wholes in the box due to the content puncturing through during shipment.  The strapping and the corner cardboard protecters seem to help keep it together.  As for the cage, we had no real issues with bent framing, other than having to use a plier to flatten out slightly bent metal, where you slip the sides of the cage down through the guide rails.  My daughter loves her birthday gift for her dilute conure. :) ", "I had purchased a cheaper cage of similar design (but smaller in dimensions) in the past and found several manufacturing flaws in it. The Prevue cage is superior to that other one. This cage assembled easily and the instructions were adequate. Fit and finish is overall very good. The material and finish coating seem of better quality. The color is uniform overall. I only found two problems, as shown in the photos. One of the bolts securing the play platform to the top of the cage went in easily. The rest were difficult to get threaded and bolted in, with one (photo) bolt hole so off center it could not be used at all. One of the provided wooden perch rods was very warped (photo), which, honestly, will be no problem as we hadn't planned on using them anyway. Overall, we are very pleased with this cage and hope the Sun Conure baby will find it a good home. I put it together by myself and I\u2019m 66. It wasn\u2019t easy but I did it and I love it. So easy to clean. We got a piece of plastic like you put under a desk chair, and cut it into pieces to fit the drawers. I just pick those up each morning and dump off dropped food, wipe it down to get rid of droppings and it\u2019s clean. Sure beats what I went through with my other cages. My bird loves it, especially the top perch. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone with a Senegal or larger parrot. So worth the money. Ethan my cockatiel loves his new home. Very easy to assemble, parts are very good quality. This was the second Prevue bird cage I purchased. The Prevue brand is a bit more expensive so when I had to buy a second bird cage, I opted for the cheaper brand. Well the cheaper brand arrived all damaged. The packaging of the cheaper brand was poorly done...so it did not survive the shipping process. I decided to purchase this cage for my cockatiel based on the awesome reviews it had received. I was expecting something high quality, but when it arrived I was blown away. The quality and sturdiness of this cage surpassed all expectations I could possibly have for a birdcage. Plus it's aesthetically pleasing and doesn't look nearly as tacky as some of the smaller plastic bottom/think wire models they sell at most pet stores. I could not recommend this product more to anyone looking for a high-quality birdcage. Plus the directions were super easy to follow and it only took about 30-45 minutes, even while being super careful and slow so as to avoid any mistakes. Everything fit together just as the directions said and the finished product feels so sturdy and high quality. Some real fit and finish issues, and some of them are bad enough to have to return the cage. I expected bent pieces in a factory sealed box from some of the reviews, and I got them. Not the end of the world... However, I had to drill and tap new holes to fit all the main, long torx screws into their adjoining pieces, as they were not done to size or threaded at the factory! If I didn't happen to have the correct bits, the cage could not have gone together and I would have been forced to try and repack it into the box for a return, which would be all but impossible and it would be getting 1 star. It's a decent enough cage for the money; assuming you get one that is not mangled and has correctly sized screw holes. I bought the cage and it had rust all over it and We are getting our first bird, a beautiful Lutina Cockatiel, in about two weeks. I bought this cage in anticipation of this.  I received the cage within 3 business days and I have to say it is more than I thought it would be!  It was packaged great, no problems with anything being scratched up or bent. It was very easy to assemble.  I did try to put it together by myself but did end up needing my hubby's help because it is hard to hold onto and put together at the same time.  It is an absolutely beautiful, sturdy, cage.  A few people that have seen it already thought it looked like a $400 cage.  I would very much recommend.  You won't be sorry! I'll try to come back as soon as we get our birdy and update on how he/she likes it. The cages are extremely sturdy and does not feel or look cheap. Also, cleaning the cages is super easy and fast as well as feeding and moving the cages from one place to another. I use Glad Press\u2019 N seal for the bottom tray. When I opened the packaging it had a strong odor. I do not suggest opening the packaging near your bird. I wiped down the cage with a wet warm cloth to remove the odor. Unfortunately, both cages were a little bit chipped. I painted the chipped areas with the paint provided to avoid rusting and left it overnight to dry and wiped it down. My sun and green cheek conure are extremely happy with their new cage! I highly recommend this cages! i opened the box and saw a thousand pieces but i must say it was not hard to put together. the wheels have a very strong rubbery scent like a new tire smell. everything fit perfectly no issues and NO DAMAGE. it was packed/protected well during shipping. overall very nice not so huge cage but good size. definitelty recommended.  photo is without the wheels i added them shortly after. I love this cage, it\u2019s color, and it\u2019s attributes like the button unlock cage, easy access bowls, and the pull out drawers for quick cleaning. I\u2019m glad I decided with the bigger size too. Easy to assemble but it is heavy and is definitely faster and safer with two or more people assembling. I was a bit nervous because I bought it used but it was very clean and had all it\u2019s parts along with extra screws. Some pieces were a little warped but nothing too serious or unworkable. I couldn\u2019t seem to make the ladder straight on the top though and there were some dents on the bottom pan, which was a bit annoying, but as said, not serious. The package came with paint to clean up scratches or spots on the cage which was very nice, although I hope the paint is safe just in case my bird decides to chip some of it off. The smell of it was really strong. All in all, beautiful cage and I hope my soon-to-come cockatiel will like it too. Will update review if there are any changes. ", "Saw same brand bird cage at our local pet store but sizes were  too small or too big.  We found the perfect size here and took a chance and purchased. It's exactly what we wanted.  It is plenty big for my 3 cockatiels and one parakeet.  They get along so we were looking to move them all in to one cage.  It arrived well packaged.  One leg was a little bent, and one bar was bent. Still the quality of this is excellent, it is made well, sturdy.  The latch is spring loaded and works fine...I am concerned that perhaps sometime in the future it could wear out but for now it works.  Highly recommend despit a few bends.  The instructions that come with this are not that great, but you can defintilty figure it out!  We used the Amazon picture to help guide us a bit. It is perfect for the baby cockatiel that my granddaughter has. I love easy access to the water and food bowls through small doors on the sides. I also live the seed catcher as well as the drawers that allow for easy clean up. In addition to the perches inside, this cage also has a perch on the top(outside) as well as a ladder, seed and water dishes and another drawer for easy cleaning! I almost forgot to mention that it's also on casters for ease of movement. The only negative was that assembly was difficult with 1 person but doable with 2. In fairness to the manufacturers,  they did recommend that the assembly be by two... I have 3 Greencheek Conures and they all had different sized cages plus I couldn't fit them all in the space I have them in together. I thought I'd go ahead and get 3 matching cages. I had worked at a pet store previously and had to assemble cages daily usually by myself so I already knew who to turn to! I bought all 3 in the black hammertone and they arrived together. Took about 1.5 hours to build ALL 3 with my husband. Easy to assemble minus the playtop part that attaches to the cage itself. On 2 of the cages the pieces you fit into each other wouldn't fit but we just hammered it a bit flat which is no big deal. We already put the one in the smallest cage in her new cage and she loves loves loves it. The other 2 will go in theirs later. I received this cage on 10/29/18. Delivery was fast.The Cage was damaged as much as possibe.Most of the cage bars were crooked.Please look at pics of the tray.  The cage lock was damaged as well.Besides that ,the bottom of the tray does not stay secure.Whenever I want to clean it falls down on the floor.My bird likes to eat while he is sitting on the tray.I put some of  his favorite food on the tray so he could it the tray fall down with my bird. It arrived damaged - with one of the large panels significantly bent.  Given the heavy weight and hassle of packing it all up again for return, we hammered the bend out as best we could with a rubber mallet.  As others have mentioned, the instructions included were for some other cage.  This left us to figure it out on our own.  It took much longer than expected to put it together due to a lot of screw holes not matching up, lack of proper instructions, missing pieces, etc.  This was especially true of the top, outer assembly, where none of the screw holes matched up at all and the required screws were not included. We found we needed to use pliers in certain areas.  Overall, assembly was a hassle perhaps equal to packing the cage up for return! I love this cage! I already had an older model but wanted to upgrade to a shiny new model as the older one was finally rusting after 10 years and some hard scrubbing. It was super easy and quick to assemble; but I had 2 other people helping me. I would not want to try it alone but it would be possible. It is very sturdy and I love the door lock and added security that the door lock stop at the top of door adds. Now I do not have to worry about my dogs accidently letting my bird out. Overall a great purchase and very spacious!. I don't use the bottom grate as my green cheeked conure loves to walk and play on the bottom. Purchased cage for our African Grey. Very sturdy and well built. Easy to put together once you are able to decipher the instructions. They need a bit more information. Although there are a few illustrations it is not clear which screws to use. Instructions call for nuts, not screws. And there are no instructions at all for seed catcher. Luckily my husband is experienced with assembling the cage for our Blue Front Amazon so he was able to put the seed catcher on. This would have been a bit of a chore for an inexperienced person I am sure. Beautiful Cage for a spoiled Cockatiel. The contents were extremely well packaged, protected and arrived in pristine condition. All contents were listed and accounted for per the SO SO instructions. Included along with the screws and nuts was a brush and touch up paint which were not needed thanks to the perfect condition of the pieces. Anticipating a big assembly project, I enlisted my favorite handyman and we proceeded to tackle the task at hand. Meh... It went together so quickly that I was almost embarrassed at having asked for help. UNTIL we began to assemble the seed guard. This was the single worst part of the entire assembly. The parts were poorly designed and required bending to line up the screw holes. WE MADE IT WORK. It took longer to finish this part of the cage than it did to unpack, sort and assemble the main component. The play structure on top of the cage is awesome and provides the perfect place for my feathered friend to perch, and includes two metal food /water bowls. The interior includes two additional metal food/water cups and one wooden perch.The end result is BEAUTIFUL. Worth every penny and the  energy spent to complete this cage. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I have added two additional food containers, a swing,  four types of perches (one is a heated gravel type), three toys, and STILL have tons of room to roam for my happy birdie. The color is not as light and minty as the picture shoes. It's much prettier, a bit deeper in color but the shade is true to the photo. Let me say that this cage is big, bigger than I thought it would be. I'm okay with that though because as a bird lover I know that there is no such thing as \"too big\" when talking a birds home. I purchased this for my Sun Conure that will soon be here to stay with me. I will update my rating after he gets here. I have one very spoiled cockatiel who LOVES his castle! He has so much room to explore and tons of toys/mirrors to keep him busy while we are working. We keep the cage door open for him when we are home, he sits on it like it's his front porch. It is very easy to clean and move around. It has been about a year now since we've had this cage, I am still very happy with my purchase! ", "After reading all the reviews, the only concern seemed to be bent bars and difficult assembly. I went ahead and ordered the cage anyways. The cage arrived on time. all the pieces were in the box and in perfect shape. everything fits perfectly. It took less than an hour to put the entire cage together using no tools at all except the hex key that comes with it. there are extra screws and nuts provided. If you are looking for a cage this is perfect. I have a Green Cheek Conure and he loves it. this cage is the smallest in the series but it is big enough for any conure or small parrot. I love this cage for my Green Cheek Conure. I bought the black hammertone color. It's very sturdy & looks nice. We actually got compliments on this cage when it was still totally empty! I can't live without the swing out feeder doors. I love the smooth rolling casters that don't damage my linoleum floors and I love the dual lock system. We usually just use the swing latch above the door, but will use the actual lock if kids come over. Releasing the lock on the door is fairly loud and could be \"jarring\" for your bird, but you can easily cushion the blow by placing your finger at the other end of the lock before pressing the release. We attempted for about 2 minutes to assemble the seed guard \"just 'cause\" but gave up pretty quickly as we didn't feel they were necessary and I had read they were a beast to assemble. The instructions require a little common sense as the literature is vague, but it's definitely doable in 30-60 minutes with another person. One of the side panels was a little bent, but once slid into place it straightened out just fine. We had very little, if any, damage to our cage upon delivery. I will actually be sizing up to the Prevue 3154, which is the same cage design, but considerably larger. This one will still be in use as a sleep cage, sun cage, and/or for visiting the in-laws. I looked at all sorts of other flight cage brands when I decided to size up, but I just LOVE this one so much that I couldn't break away. None Great cage!! My blue quaker loves it. Arived on time, box was a little banged up, but no damage to cage. First, this is the second cage, the first one never came!  Next, the instructions were less than sufficient, pictures were difficult to make out also.  When we were putting it together, neither one of the perches fit the cage or the top perch.  We had to cut one of them to fit, the other one was way too short to use ANYWHERE!  The design of the cage isn't very good either.  The dishes that are inside the cage are attached to their doors which I like but there's no way to put a perch in front of those dishes for the bird to get to them!!  Luckily, I had one of those screw in perches that only needs one side screwed in so I was able to get around that problem.  I had to dig up old perches THAT FIT to put in the cage.  I didn't want OLD anything in her new cage but............anyway, REALLY, for over $150 you'd think, at least, you'd get what the picture shows! So. I would not suggest this cage to anyone, unless you want to go out and buy one of those single sided, screw in perches and be prepared to do some cutting to give your little friend a perch on top. Our Quaker loves it. We bought this cage to upgrade from the wire cage given to us when we adopted our rescue quaker parrot. We are so very pleased with this cage. The quality is excellent. We shopped for cages for months now. We went to pet stores and looked and read reviews of dozens of cage models and makers. We went with this since the overall reviews were good, there was a youtube video that showed us exactly what we were purchasing, and it was a great price overall. We are so glad we made this choice. Our baby took a bit to warm up but today his first full day in it and he is doing just fine. The instructions are a bit undetailed but if you are savvy and handy, it really is not a problem. If you are like me (the hubby is the savvy and handy one) you can view a youtube video on the assembly. Just type the cage model in search and you will see a man who walks you through it step by step. We noticed that in shipping one side of the frame was slightly bent and made the latch a bit difficult. But we made it work just fine and I called Amazon and they were the best at customer service and gave us a discount for the issue. We also saw a review that stated something about sharp parts on the bars, we didn't find a thing. We checked every inch and the only thing we saw was where the paint drip and dried and it was a bit sharp. And this was just 1 tiny tiny tiny spot. If you just scrap it off and use the touch up paint, you wont have a issue. You will not be sorry with this purchase!!! I purchased this about a month ago for my Quaker parrot when it was on sale with free shipping.  She loves it. It is a bigger cage than we probably needed, but toys do take up internal space and there's still plenty of room for her to move around and stretch her wings. I am partial to playtop cages as my birds are only caged for sleep and when no one is home. It gives them personal space while allowing them to interact with eachother and me. The play area has an easy to clean tray and offers a lot of room for toys as well.  I do line trays with newspaper to keep the poop and food off the metal and empty the tray daily. When I first received the cage I took stock of the damaged items...one of the huge treys had a nasty dent, and some of the wiring was a little out of whack. I hammered out what I could and then proceded to try and assemble the cage....THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG. In my manual it says to secure the frame together using steel nuts. Don't do this, the holes are all designed only to be screwed in, and if you use the nut...you'll get the worst fitting cage ever. Got this cage for an African Grey we adopted.  We had a large cage outside but with years of sun and wind, paint is all powdery. ", "I bought the 30\"x22\"x63\" cage and I must say it's impressive. Plenty of room for my Sun Conure and fits a lot of toys to keep him busy. The cage did come a little bit damaged from shipping however I was able to bend the pieces back to how they needed to be with a hammer or pliers. I can't say enough good things about this cage, it rolls anywhere you need it to go and is heavy enough to not be moved by my dogs and cat. The bird feels very safe in it and can fly within the cage if he desires. The birds happiness was my top priority and even though this cage is pricey it was definitely worth it. This has been an awesome upgrade for our conure. His last cage was significantly bigger, but he seems much happier in this one. I especially like that the playstand above has food and water dishes and it's own tray to collect debris. We have a much more content bird since purchasing this cage! The poop guards on the sides are also especially helpful because that was always an issue before. Overall, a great value for the money. I have had other Prevue cages and never had a problem.  This size was big enough to put my two conures in since they were always in each others cages anyway and they seem to enjoy being together.  I am a senior female and I put it together myself it took me about two hours tops, would have been less if I had help, but it wasn't difficult. Instructions were terrible. If you are not mechanically inclined you may have some difficulty assembling the unit. Seed guard was dented and unusable. I expected a better quality product for the price tag. This is an amazing cage for the price.  I have spent much more on my other cages and they are smaller and not as good.  First, this cage is a great size.  Plenty of room for my Goffin's Cockatoo to play.  Then, the door locks are perfect for a smart and curious birdie.  There are two different mechanisms to keep the main door closed and the main one is spring loaded and cannot be reached with a beak.  The food door latches also cannot be reached from inside.  The wire gauge and spacing is wonderfully safe for a medium sized bird. Finally, it was very easy to assemble and is very sturdy.  I love this cage so much I bought another from the same brand for my other birdie. After reading other reviews I was a little worried. The cage came with all parts, nothing bent or broken. I found it pretty simple to put together. One of the panels was a little confusing where the food bowls go. (Make sure your lock faces down) my cinnamon cheek conure loves it and I would put it together a million times again before I paid the prices they want for the same cage at the pet store. I hesitated buying this cage because of the 1-star and 2-stars comments.  It arrived yesterday,and today my daughter and I followed the instructions with out a mishap nor frustration.  the cage is very sturdy and the the parts were all there.  no damaged parts.  I am delighted with my investment.  I would recommend this cage for a small parrot. I guess it depends on what you're used to. I'm trying to get a new cage for my Cockatiel (he's been in his for 10 years, and it's starting to show its age), and this seemed like a good bet. Not only was it much smaller than I expected (I did measure it out before purchase), but it arrived damaged. The top bar on one side was badly dented, and the pieces that I did put together didn't fit well; the screws didn't line up with the holes, which was very frustrating. Also, they include a thing of touch up paint, and mine exploded in transit which was something of a mess. Overall, the quality of the cage is disappointing, but that may also be partly because my current cage is very sturdy. I'm just grateful for Amazon's return policy! I read all the reviews before purchasing. I was a little skeptical but purchased anyway,(24x20) it came with the box roughed up by UPS but it survived thanks to good packaging. I put it together by myself (a 2nd person would have been easier) it took about an hour. I purchased it as replacement cage for my green cheek (petey) it is a great cage for the money and Petey took to it right away. I'm going to buy the next size larger (30x22) for my double yellow head (ringo). the only con that I found is I wish it had storage underneath. THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE Packages arrived looking like they had been through the Delta baggage handlers at the airport and several parts inside were damaged. Per the enclosed material, I contacted Prevue Pet Products for assistance. Customer service there really stepped up to the plate and replaced all the damaged items. Replacement parts arrived in good condition. Cage is well made with the exception of some minor issues fitting the components together. ", "I've purchased a number of cages over the past 15 years and this is one of the nicest of them all.  It was a little expensive so I got the hammered black which cost less, but I had just recently gotten the Preview Parrot perch that only came in this color so they ended up making a nice color coordinated area for my bird.  This is probably the first cage I ever had shipped to me that was not damaged, in fact, it was in perfect condition and also easy to assemble.  Whatever color you choose, this particular cage is a very good investment, and I believe you won't regret buying it.  Oh, I would give it 5 stars except for the color, but you may prefer it. It took me forever to decide on a cage for my cockatiel, though I can say I'm definitely pleased with my purchase. It wasn't too bad to assemble (I did it by myself) and it looks great.  The cage arrived in great condition with no damage. You may have to finesse some of the screws, though with patience, I assure you the cage will fit together nicely. This is definitely a nice cage for the price. I  first got one for my Indian Ringneck Parakeet; I liked it so much that I got a second one for my Sun Conure! Honestly, assembly can be a pain in the rear as sometimes the metal arrives bent and the instructions enclosed seem to be meant for another cage with different parts. Common sense, patience, and a lot of swearing eventually paid off. Once it's finally assembled, it's a great cage, very spacious and sturdy. Overall, I am quite happy with this cage, in fact I've ordered a second one to replace an old cage. I have the black Hammertone color and it is solid and looks great (doesn't look cheap). It comes together pretty well, but the one-sided sheet of instructions was bush! Seriously, take a few deep breaths before you get started and take your time. In all it took 20-30 min to erect the cage. That and the fact that the seed catcher is not perfect are the only drawbacks for me. Things I really like about it include the fact that it doesn't need a table or stand, it has wheels to move it for cleaning, it has a seed catcher-its not perfect, but its much better than having nothing, its a nice size for 2 cockatiels with enough room for our 3rd to spend the day with her buddies, and go to her own cage at night. Very easy put together and keep clean. Perfect size for my needs. I have an umbrella cockatoo who is out most of the day. I love that I can easily move the cage around. Cleans perfectly with a hose. I wouldn't recommend this size for birds larger than conures or cockatiels, though, if they are in their cage most of the day. Came without adequate packaging and was damaged, one of the tabs that hold side wall was crushed flat had to use channel locks and a hammer/block to straighten. The seed barrier is warped/ bent corners don't align to well. Very happy with the cage overall. It was fairly easy to assemble and has been easy to clean. There were some dents in the metal tray and bent bars possibly from shipping. It\u2019s a sturdy and secure cage, fits great on a weather tech all purpose mat! The cage catches about 50% of debris (seeds, etc.). I like the play station on top and the individual doors for the food and water bowls so you don\u2019t always have to reach through the cage. Our Quaker loves her new cage! I wasn\u2019t if it would be big enough based on some of the photos but it is the perfect size. I included some photos to show her size in comparison to the cage. It was a two person job to assemble. I appreciate that they include a small jar of touch up paint. Only issue I have is the seed barriers don\u2019t seal all the way and sometimes seed or dried bird droppings fall on the floor while I clean instead of into the tray. But that would not prevent me from recommending this. This cage is bigger than I had anticipated. I have a quaker & parakeet inside, but it would be ideal for African Grey/Amazon size as well. My quaker is spoiled and I am gone during the day, so I wanted this size. Assembly was surprisingly easy and the wheels are a nice addition. The guardrails do help a little bit with throwing seeds. Large bowl sizes and they lock in, which is nice if your bird is an instigator like mine. The trays are easy to clean and the upper play portion is great when you're home but don't want your bird on you. I would definitely recommend this cage. I did have an issue with shipping, and the sending called to correct it right away. My only complaint is they didn't have the color I really wanted in stock and they didn't do much to provide me with other options. Our cage arrived quickly considering we live in Hawaii and good size for our conure so that was some pluses.  Took 2 stars off for the multiple damaged/bent parts in the iron (This was very disappointing to see) and the latches on the door of the dishes are very easy to open that I expect our bird to be able to get them open so we will have to apply additional fasteners to the dish doors.  Other than that cage seems very sturdy and its tall. ", "Do NOT wash this cage thinking you\u2019re having a good spring cleaning day! We purchased this cage a few years back. Within a year, the latching piece for the food dishes fell off. For the past few years, we\u2019ve been using bent paper clips to keep it closed. Finally, I said enough is enough and I ordered a new one. I absolutely love this cage ! I am so happy I bought this for my bird.  He deserved an upgrade and he is loving it.  It\u2019s such a gorgeous and sturdy cage and not  flimsy at all.  The box it came in was very heavy and I actually had my cousin and her husband come over and he put it together for me.  It\u2019s a great size for my lovebird.  And he has plenty of room.  The grate slides out easily and so confit when it comes to cleaning it For the price, it is well worth it. With the video you can find online, it was pretty easy to assemble, minus a few slip ups of my own. Mine was not bent at all and slid into place pretty well. It is exactly what I was expecting, solid and good quality product. The only issue is that the perch bar that goes on top of the play top was built wrong for me. I could only put one of the perch food bowls in because my bar had one hole drilled in the wrong place (i checked multiple times and it was not because i set up the top wrong!.) But it was not the biggest deal to me as the play top food bowls did not matter too much to me. But it is possible to have defects! Some bent parts but didn't cause a problem with assembly, which didn't take much time.  Top wouldn't attach since holes didn't match up but it's heavy so no problem. Biggest problem was it needed a lot of touch up paint. Multiple areas were not fully sprayed and the metal showed thru. Very disappointing paint job. I guess quality control wasn't working the day this one was painted. Would have given 4 stars if not for the sub par paint job. It is nice and roomy for the birds though, they are very happy. Bought this cage for a black capped conure. Got the small sage green cage for a great price. Came with a few bent pieces, but we were able to get it together in under an hour. It was missing one rubber thing that goes on the bottom of the leg and attaches the castor wheel, making it impossible to attach the 4th wheel. Too difficult To remove other wheels after putting them in, so we had a wobbly cage (cue rage, followed by \u201cmeh\u201d). We\u2019ll  look into a replacement part or some sort of diy solution. Til then, the leg is supported by a cigar box, ha. This is a really top notch cage that is well worth the price, in fact, best I've seen in this price range.  My 19 year old Red Spectacled Amazon has just gotten so excited with the play area and nice size.  The seed trap is a bit of a pain to clean, as it turns out ole Harpo likes to hang over the edge to poop.  Harpy is wheeled into the sunroom daily, the rollers work very well traversing the carpet from wood floors. My parrots likes this upgrade.. it is a sturdy case and was easy to assemble however the paint seems to be peeling off at a few spots.  The seed catcher is not very efficient,  so I took it off. Overall a great buy, i saw it was almost 25 bucks cheaper on wayfair. I would like if the seller can match the price. 24x20x60---  After a long time searching i settled on this cage. I think its a solid cage overall, some pieces come a little bent and some of the holes were not punched all the way through.  But not a huge deal, i was able to get everything back in order.... It doesnt take long to put together, certainly would be helpful if you had a second person holding things in place.  I ran into a few confusing things with the playtop and the seed catchers but eventually figured it out with pictures and videos.  I ultimately left off the seed catchers because it didnt fit in the space i needed it to, it really bulked up the cage.  My cockatiels seem to love it. Very happy with how strong the cage is, high quality stainless bowls, and sturdy litter shelves.  Large front door makes cleaning and hanging toys very simple for a large cage (I'm reviewing the largest option in White).  Don't underestimate the depth of the largest one -- a full 32\" away from the wall is more than you might expect. That distance is with the optional debris catchers installed (recommended but they do add a lot to how far from the wall the cage sticks out). ", "I bought this cage for my GCC and was very pleased with it at first. Then the paint started chipping on the grate after maybe 6 months. I do sometimes use a scrubby sided sponge when cleaning, so I assumed it was my own fault. However, after about 8 months, the door where her water dish is has gotten really rusty! I have still not quite had it a year so the fact that I already have 2 issues, one of which is a serious safety hazard for my bird, is unacceptable! I don't want to have to buy another new cage after only a year with this one so hopefully the company responds soon and will do something to compensate me. I bought this birdcage for my African Grey Timneh. He is quite a talkative birdie who needs to be properly spoiled. It was quite easy for me to assemble myself even though the directions suggest 2 people. (The less coordinated of us may want to have a helper.) This cage gives ample room for little twerp to do his birdie business. It came with one wooden perch to go inside of the cage. I then tricked out the cage with a couple more perches and a bunch of birdie toys. Love this cage I got it for my Quaker and he has lots of room and he is enjoying the rooftop play area. He seems happy and for that it makes me happy. I recommend this bird cage. Easy to assemble easy instructions to follow and everything was there no missing pieces. This cage was scheduled for Sunday delivery and came within 24 hrs. After reading so many reviews it looks like there is a mix up between a cheaper version of the cage sold by Super Deal Pro and Prevue Pet Products. I'm extremely satisfied with my Prevue cage. We bought a $500+ acrylic bird cage - thinking it would be less messy (birds tend to fling their food). Big mistake!  The acrylic cage also traps in the moisture and SMELL!  And we still had a big mess to clean up every time we changed the bottom papers. THIS cage is great!  A few things land on the floor still-but it is SO MUCH EASIER to keep clean. And our Black Headed Caique LOVES IT! Great cage. Easy to assemble if you've built your fair share of IKEA furniture. Only bad thing was a small oil bottle inside had exploded and stunk so bad. The fumes burned my eyes so I took the box outside. One of the bowls is covered in it and I can't get it clean. But apart from that, whole cage was in great condition and assembled without trouble. Bird loves it. The medium one is HUGE! :) I looked at all kinds of bird cages and their prices.  This one turned out to be perfect for my area. It's made really well and didn't break the bank in buying it.  The only con is that the  perch does not fit in front of the feed dish and water.  It is ok because my cockatiel  sits on the edges of the dishes. She likes her playground at the top of the cage. Putting the cage together was a little confusing at first but my boyfriend came to the rescue and did the job in a couple of hours. I absolutely love this. It looks stunning on my hardwood floor in front of the front window. I got this for my messing Cockatiels (even though vacuuming is needed once every one to two days) but the tray does help hold in a lot of the seeds from the messy eaters and some feathers from their preening. Great cage overall but not easy to clean. I have to take it outside and literally hose it off from time to time.  Its actually way too large for my conure. I should have purchased the smaller one. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon open box one to save some money. It wasn\u2019t complete and had to be sent back. You can always tell it isn\u2019t all there until you\u2019ve partly assembled and then have to take it back apart and re-package. Total pain. The platinum is a silver color. Think this cage is a quality one though! Seed skirts are rounded corner and many aren\u2019t. ", "It arrived with some minor dings and chips in the paint, hence the 4 stars, but we were able to assemble it just fine after a little wiggling. The slight damage hasn't ruined the overall integrity of the cage. I bought this for my adult son who has an African Gray parrot. I was with him when he put it together and it is such a huge improvement over the homemade wood-and-screen cage the bird came to him in. It is SO WELL MADE. A few connections needed to be bent back into the proper shape. But a needle nose pliers worked great to do that. Whoever designed this thing was really thinking! So many destructive things that parrots can do with their cages are foiled by the design. I agree with other reviewers that it's better to have 2 people help put it together. Peeps took to the cage immediately. I Googled the cage before purchase. Only Walmart.com had it for the same price but delivering it to my son's home would have cost extra. Of course, Amazon has \"Super Saver Shipping\" and it arrived 4 days after I ordered it!! My son tells me this is THE BEST gift I've ever given him! That makes mom happy!!! Great product! Love the sage green. Cage is solid but came not just bent but with breaks at wire connection points in two places. A welded corner wedge necessary for proper assembly of components was completely broken off, requiring a workaround. With workarounds it serves its purpose. So wire is generally strong and cage looks good, but there are important design flaws Lovely big cage! I have a conure and he walks around it just fine! There were some parts that came in a little bent but we quickly fixed them with some pliers. Metal is sturdy! Very convenient slots to take out all the bird droppings and the perch on top is awesome! Love it! Greta price too! Try finding one of these at a store for less then 300$. You would have to have coupons for days! This is a very nice, sturdy cage at a very affordable price.  My husband had it put together in less than an hour and the only problem with it was the touch up paint had opened and leaked into one of the dishes.  It was easily cleaned up with a brillo pad however so all is well.  They should think about putting the paint into a sealed plastic bag in case it opens.  But overall we are very happy with this purchase and our parrot loves it.  Whoever designed it clearly knew their parrots, from the push button/slide handle on the door that he will never be able to open, to the pull out grate for easy cleaning that clips so it can't be pushed out and the bars over the food dishes to keep them from being tipped. Best of all the seed catchers that keep all the mess inside the cage!  If you are thinking about buying this cage don't hesitate, it is a lot of cage for a reasonable price. Great cage for my Jenday Conure! He stays in here durin the night to sleep or rainy day! I am glad I got this good size for my baby and it is easy for me to change the food & water and clean the cage! All the food drop are catched on the tray atatch to tge cage outside, slide all go into the bottom of the cage! Love this very much! Yes,  I can recommend this! I ordered this cage for way less here than any other sites. Some Bird sites are selling it for over $400 and I paid $172. I love that it comes in different colors, so got one to match our kitchen. Nice quality cage for the price.  As other reviewers have noted, parts were a little bent from shipping. Side panels were slightly bent, a tab was bent. My strong husband had to muscle these parts to get everything to fit. Got it together, took about half an hour - didn't want to put the seed catchers on. Minimal touch up. The cage smells slightly toxic and so does touch up paint, so we'll let it off gas for a little while before we put our conure in it. I am being picky here but i feel like their quality control is lacking a little bit. had 2 holes which were not fully cleared and had to use a punch tool to unblock so be ready to do some fixing.  If i could i would only remove half a star for this issue. ", "Update: The cage itself, is wonderful, high-quality and easy to clean. However, mine came slightly not ready (one hole for a food dish had not been drilled in a piece) and though I tried to rectify it myself, and then contacted the company about it - replying to numerous requests for additional information about the replacement part needed because I didn't buy it from them, I have never received the part. They were very polite, but in the long-run, did not correct the problem. And I waited a couple months to write a review to see if they would correct it. Silly Senegal fits fine in this cage, he likes to hang out on the play top.  I added manzanita perches so my bird\u2019s feet get some exercise and a sand perch for his nails.  This is my second cage from this company and this one has a better powder coat finish, easier to clean.  Should last a long time, I think. I took advice of other reviews to invest a little extra money for my birdcage. I cannot be happier with this cage for my single cockatiel.  There is plenty of room for toys, bath, etc. She loves the above cage play area. The cage is sturdy, mobile and thoughtfully made. I place my birdcage in different areas of the house with ease for cleaning and activity. It's easy to clean and the side panels catch a lot of debris.  I would buy it again. I purchased the 18 x 18 size, but would get the next size up for two cockatiels. Great buy! Received the item in damaged condition. Noticed after I put it together. Not the best quality. Great color, fits any interior, can put up to 3 cockatiels I believe, I have one for now, but I defiantly believe he can have another two friends easily, easy to clean. Only upsetting thing is it came with a bottle of color to cover future damage and it was broken and leaked all over the bowls and instructions, it was hard to read it, and even harder to clean the bowls from it. Product was okay assembling, did it by myself . Although the cage is beautiful. The only problem I had was the big piece where it\u2019s supposed to catch food is poorly put together. Had a very hard time making the 4 pieces connect and when I did it looked horrible so I just left it off. Yes I did read the prints, I am a bearing inspector at my job so I read prints very carefully.. overall I recommend the cage. Did notice when I opened the package the metal was hot so maybe it bent and that\u2019s what gave me trouble. Fabulous!  Easy to put together.  Took me about an hour by myself.  Bought it in red and it is beautiful.  Looks great with my decor and have gotten lots of compliments on it from visitors.  Our cockatiel loves the space and large feeder bowls.  Well made and easy to clean.  Love the seed catchers that keep my house much cleaner than old cage.  Love the rollers so can move it anywhere, even on my travertine tiles. Both me and my Quaker approve of this cage. I removed a star because of a few chips in paint, but there were many noticable dents and bent parts on this product, even a bent leg on the stand which makes the cage unlevel and I can't bend it into place...  but his toes don't get stuck anywhere (which is why I replaced his other prevue bird cage of a different style) it seems very safe, all doors lock and I am overall pleased with it. Boxed ok, instructions were fine, only minor bends in the metal when it arrived. ", "As other reviewers have said, this cage comes with limited directions and takes a long time to figure out and put together (about two hours). We didn't run into any bent pieces and any paint chipping was easily fixed with the touch up paint that was included. Although there was a flaw on the ladder of the play top. Its hard to describe and if you order this, you will understand what I'm talking about better. The ladder on the play top is two pieces, each attaches to the metal piece with the perch by two screws on each side, then the ladder comes down to attach to the cage on each side by one screw. Well one side the ladder had two screw holes instead of one where it attaches, so we ended up just screwing one hole into the cage. So it's a tad crooked, but isn't noticeable unless looked for. This is a second large cage for our African Grey parrot. He's really not good at having new things (toys, cages, etc.) so he's just now starting to like being in the living room in the new cage. Cage was nice quality; we ordered for our cinnamon cockatiel. We put it together easily but realized afterwards that it's pretty low to the ground and we have two greyhounds and a cat that would be eye level with our bird so it's not acceptable, unfortunately we have to return. If it had taller legs or if the cage portion was higher it would be perfect. Just after writing my review, I looked up and noticed sitting on the couch in it's protective wrapping were the seed guards we forgot to put back in the box when we returned it yesterday. Can someone let us know how to get the seed guards back to you (amazon). Thanks!! Sturdy well made and easy to assemble. This is the smallest cage fit for only a single cockatiel. Not much room to really flap wings. Two birds would probably be miserable unless they small maybe a few budgies could live happily in here but u would have to buy smaller (narrower?) perches. I love the trays and the play area on top. My bird spends most of her day outside the cage but she seems to be very comfortable inside. VERY quick and easy to put together! I'm a small, petite 26 year old girl and I was able to put it together myself! These are amazing cages. These cages will last a very long time. I did order at Christmas time amd the shipping company used a couple of the boxes for kicking practice or something. Both Prevue AND Amazon were amazing with customer service. i purchased this cage for my green cheek conure, it's perfect, it's nice and long for her her to climb around in, which she loves, and the play top is where she hangs out supervised. when i received it i couldn't wait till the evening for help in putting it together, so i did it all on my own, very easy. i think it's an excellent cage and the pewter color is very pretty. This bird cage far exceeds my expectations. I have been searching for the perfect beautiful spacious cage for my Green Cheek Pinnapple Conure and we couldn't be more pleased. We purchased the medium size and it's perfect. It's super easy to clean and includes an extra safety latch for the door. Love the play area on top. Looks beautiful in the house. Very very pleased! No complaints! Toys are no problem to hang! Easy to put together. My sun conure likes his new cage. The only down side is that there are no small doors like a smaller traditional cage where you can add a bird bath on the outside of the cage. And the bird can enter/exit the bath without the need to exit the cage. I recently bought the Prevue \"Penthouse\" which is Prevue's model # 3153 cage. It was shipped in two very large cartons and there was a delay of a few days between their delivery. That said, I have no other complaints with this cage - It is well built, heavy duty, has a nice finish (I chose the Sage color) and my Congo African Grey parrot LOVES it. It is situated in my living room and I can happily report that it looks quite attractive there. My bird inspected it very carefully - being the sort of bird who inspects EVERYthing carefully, and after he had made his full rounds and peered at every joint and corner, rewarded me with many songs and bird call imitations to let me know I had done a good thing by giving him this wonderful new \"bedroom\". ", "We have two of these and both work out very well.  There is some simple assembly required.  The base helps keep those fly away seed casings off the floor.  The food and water bowls are easy to access, use, and clean.  The doors all function properly.  The stand and bowls on top are great for those who let their birds out to fly.  Cleaning is simple and fast.  The cage is sturdy.  For an improvement, it would be nice if all four wall panels had parallel bars (two side have parallel bars and the other two have vertical bars).  The birds seem to prefer the parallel bars for climbing. We loved the design and the fact that it's wrought iron, but their were some problems with installing it. There was a small ball of metal (that wasn't supposed to be there) that prevented a male part from connecting to a female part. Another section there was a design issue that prevented the connection. One star off because we weren't able to install item. One star off because we had to return it. Why not give it a one star? Because this item (if assembled) would look great in your house! It's a little on the small side. Not big enough to put in the recommended 7 toys a bird needs. My cockatiel has more room! I do feel that the seed catchers don't really do anything. My cockatiel loves to throw her pellets and it doesn't do much to catch seeds when she's eating. Also, it takes up a lot of space with the catchers on. But overall a great cage if you have multiple birds! An excellent product that has been thoughtfully designed and our Indian Ring Neck is very happy with it. Construction is good with only one small flaw, a main door hinge that was welded on slightly crooked but still functions fine with minor binding. I don't expect it to cause long term issues.  The cage is a great value and a must have for medium sized (and up) birds. It hold our two conures comfortably. I wish it came with more sticks or accessories. I have made things to hang on top and in their cage. Maybe more perch sticks other than the 2 ( one for top and one for inside). The doors that swing to put food and water makes daily maintance simple. It helps me not having to stick my hand in the cage because my 2 year old is a biter. The wheels make it easy to move so I can sweep under it. The guard and tray make picking up seedlings a breeze. Just the right cage to start off with my birdies. We have 2 cockatiels they love this unit. We bought the larger version of this unit (or very similar to this unit) first. The other unit was so large it wouldn't fit through standard sized door ways. This unit is great - easily moves through the house. We stuck with the other unit for nearly a year. I recently removed the tray around the base of the cage, as it didn\u2019t do a great job of containing the mess. My birds love the sky deck but the interior dimensions are not conducive to flying up or down inside the cage. In my opinion, a better design would be to have more width & less height. This cage would be pretty nice, if I didn't have to get creative trying to assemble the darn seed guard/perches! Most of the cage is great and I love the color, but the seed guard arrived *so bent* that it is completely unusable. The angles just don't match up, even if you carefully follow the instructions (which are not very helpful). Additionally, I had to sand down the ends of the top perch to make it usable with this cage, since it was a full inch too long. I usually don\u2019t write reviews, but I feel I need to on this product. It was shipped and received when they said (I got this in 2 days). The packing was great. It is in excellent condition. It was also easy to put together. My 13 year old daughter and I put it together while my husband was still at work. Very nice cage. Thank you. I am looking to replace a cage for my cockatoo. This one looks great and the reviews are good. But twice I have received damaged cages and have had to send them back. The last time a cage was delivered it was the same box with a damaged cage I had sent back. Not sure what I am going to do now. ", "I bought this cage as an upgrade for my moustache parakeet, and he LOVES it! He warmed up to it very quickly and it looks really nice in my living room. My bird loves to climb around the bars that hold the perch up at the top! Nice well made cage, I was worried after ordering it that the bars may be too wide apart for a Lovebird, But it works fine. Purchased this and it arrived today.  Packaged appeared to be sturdy however I found some pieces inside had been bent.  It was ok though as I was able to bend them back and were fine.  Hubby ended up working late so I put this together myself (sort of).  I am unable to get the u part together for the top play area so hubby can tackle that. The only problem with this cage is that the initial smell from the packaging? and/or paint on the cage? was extremely bad.  We had to air it out on our patio overnight. Even though the instruction sheet requires a magnifying glass, this birdcage gets five stars. It went together without a problem. Our Jenday Conure loves it. It's easy to clean and very attractive. Well designed with birds in mind. This is a small cage, and isn't for large parrots, but if you have a small bird, this is a wonderful cage. It assembles easily, has an easy access top play area, and is very secure. The front latch uses a push button to open, and there is a 2nd backup lock installed above the front door which must be slid up. It's virtually escape proof. The casters are large ball shaped, and roll easily. This is very stable going from room to room. The splatter catch is higher than usual (it's about 6\" above the bottom), but works very well. The design is well thought out both for bird and owner. Read the reviews and had NONE of the problems others reported. Took me 45 mins to put together minus the seed catcher. I am a middle aged woman and didn't need any assistance. My Goffin cockatoo loves it. After a research, I bought Prevue Pet Products cage for my Cockatiel in Chalk white MODEL N 3152. It is very nice pet home-cage, here is why: Cage is very solid and well built.  I ended up selling this cage 3 months after I purchased it because I don't like the how tall it is.  My tiel was clipped before he learned how to fly and when he'd fall he'd end up breaking some tail feathers.  Height is not as important as length when it comes to bird cages and yet most manufactures make tall rather than long cages.  For around the same price I'd recommend the prevue F070 divided cage, you can remove the divider and have one very large cage for a small to medium bird.  While I think this is a well made, great quality cage, I can't recommend it due to its odd dimensions. it comes in pieces that you have to assemble (duh), but it's not hard to put together.  A single person can do it, although two would make it a lot easier.  My problem w/a shipped cage is that the seed guards are usually always pretty beat up.  & in the case w/this cage, one of the places for a screw was messed up (couldn't get the screw in - the screw seemed fine though).  I don't know how to fix it, & shipping the defective part back & waiting for a replacement would have taken forever.  I just made do. ", "Was easy to put together but im very handy. I looked at all the negitive reviews before I bought this an it seemed like cages would show up damaged from delivery. I took a chance an mind was not damage easy to put together an my yellow nape amazon loves it. Bought the 2nd to large one. I could have done with the smaller one because the cage is quite large. Think the smaller one would have been enough cage and space for my parrot. He seems to like it. It came in what looked like a nice safe package but it was uneven and took a very long time to assemble. The top did not fit correctly, and the seed trays were damaged. The screws would not even remotely thread for the seed trays. I managed to bend the top part's final peg to make it fit. So all in all I have a somewhat assembled bird cage for my 3 month old bird. Very unhappy with this purchase. Really a good buy, the product was free from defects other than a tiny dent that isn't visible and doesn't affect functionality of the product. Thank goodness for Prime because the box is a little heavy, would hate to have lugged this thing from a store. It was easy to put together and very roomy for my conure. The idea of this cage was just what we wanted and would have been perfect if the holes lined up, the crews fit the holes and if everything thing wasn\u2019t bent all to hell. We were very disappointed in this cage. This was a birthday present for my daughter. We didn\u2019t open it and put it together till now so it\u2019s too late to return. Just what I was looking for. I came home and  my husband had already assembled it, he said it was easy. Looks good, good size for my caique. I wanted him to have more space without taking over my living room. I am thinking I might take the seed guard back off though, so it will sit flush on the wall. The last cage he figured out how to open, even with clips on it, this one he cant get out. He enjoys his house a lot more now though that it is bigger and filled with things to do to The only thing I wish it had was a spot to hang toys on the play area. And the lock on the door was a bit tweeked, but works perfectly. Easy to assemble, I wasn't sure which size to get but the 18x18 was perfect for my Senegal parrot. The play area ontop is great and very secure. The food and water bowls are a a great size, and are easy to take out and clean. Overall I am very impressed with the quality of this cage and the price. It comfortably keeps my Senegal parrot. The 18x18 is appropriate for 1 parrot, in the senegal/cocketeil/meyers parrot size range. Easily would hold 2 small parrots with room to spare. If you have an African grey or a parrot comparible in size I would get the next size cage up. I hesitated to buy the cage because of the feedback about bad shipping., i.e.,  damaged parts.  Returning something as heavy duty as this cage would have been awful.  I believe the company took the feedback seriously.  The box came with reinforcements on every corner of the box.  Also everything was zipped tied tightly so nothing moved around.  So there was no damage.  Instructions are basically a bunch of pictures, with very little description, but the setup wasn't too bad.  The best news is that my Cockatiel is very happy.  He's 22 so I was afraid he wouldn't.  You'll need to by extra 18\" perches because the cage only has one. Very nice cage. Package came with everything, nothing damaged, and even though it says it might take two people to assemble, I was able to assemble it with no problems myself. It took a couple of tries to get my bird to go into it (since it was new), but since getting her into it she seems at home. The whole thing can be assembled with a single allen wrench (included) and comes with a bottle of touch up paint and brush in case of any scratches during shipping. I didn't have any at all. The wires were all straight, everything fit perfectly. I highly recommend this cage. The color (I chose a brown color to match my apartment) is just a little bit darker than in the photos, but that makes it even better for me. It is a pretty good value. This is an attractive cage. I am always leery of foreign made products because of lack of hazardous materials. So, a bit paranoid about the paint/finish of the cage, I say this because it came with touch up paint and a brush.  Casters aren't the best, seed catcher is OK. Perches and ladder are minimal quality. With that, I have updated the perches, and covered the ladder with material for climbing comfort. The food and water bowl access and placement is extremely awkward. You may want to upgrade these although I haven't yet. Again, good value, attractive and bird transitioned well to it. ", "I got this for my parrot about a year and a half ago and it has been wonderful! It\u2019s nice and big so she has lots of space to play in. The side doors for food and water are great too! I found it really easy to clean with the two removable trays and the removable bottom. Olive (my parrot) loves it and so do I! I purchased this cage to match one I already had and this was perfect. It\u2019s as described, sturdy and looks very nice set up. My green cheek conure loves this cage. I love this cage for our pet conure Bibi. It took her some time being in it as she was not used to this type of cage when we got her. She loves to hang around the gym area. She only really spends time in it at night because we leave her out most of the day. It's a great quality cage,  nice, and for the most part easy to assemble. A great cage that is sturdy and easy to put together and I love the seed catcher beyond words. I gave a 4 star because the top part did not fit very well. The holes for the screws did not align (I think the metal may be warped somehow) and I ended up leaving one screw out and using a zip tie instead. It works fine for now. We have been living with our Parrot for over 4o years. It was time to downsize her cage without creating harm.  We are Seniors now, we just could not take care of the cage she was in anymore the way we like. My Amazon seems to have adjusted well to his new home.  I like the bird proof features with the little catch that prevents the door from closing all the way, if desired.  The seed cups are well designed and the bird cannot tip them like he used to do in his old cage.The top platform is great, since it can be lined with paper and gives him an alternative place to keep an eye on everything.His favorite hangout is the top of the opened cage door though. The cage arrived in good condition with very good packaging. The package is heavy and a little awkward to get in the front door.  I did need help from my son to assemble the sides, since it takes more than one person to put it together. The directions were adequate to figure out the assembly, and it took less than an hour to put it together.The coco brown color is really a softer light brown/copper shade. The picture color was accurate. Decent cage good size for the money. The box came smelling strongly of insecticide was nervous to even put a bird in there but realized the smell was on the outside of the box and not on the cage parts themselves. Bowls are decent so far just can't find the same size replacements for the brackets. A few paint chipped spots but they give you a small touch up paint bottle. For the price it was a good deal. I paid over $250 for my first one at a bird store. This one is has a bigger cage area and $100 less. Great quality and easy to put together. Just wish the legs were a bit longer like my other cage cause this one sits kinda low. But overall, a great cage. I'm not quite sure why everyone has had such a hard time putting the cage together, my fianc\u00e9 and I put the cage together in under twenty minutes for our Green Cheek Conure and hardly looked at the directions. Came with no damage despite to fact that the box had multipe baseball size holes from transit! Fit together wonderfully and all of the pieces lined up. We had no trouble with bolts being to short or to long. All together I was a little skeptical to order this cage because of all the reviews, a little common sense and this cage is a breeze to assemble. (We did two day shipping so this was a rushed order) there is an odor from the oil they use to coat the wheels with but if you air it out prior to placing your bird in it you'll be fine. I am very happy with my purchase and would order it again in the future, as well as recommend it to anyone! I bought two of these cages and assembled both over the weekend. This cage is not horrible, but I would not buy it again. If returning them was not such a hassle (they are already assembled), I would have returned them. ", "This is hands down the BEST bird cage we have ever purchased.  The ease of changing the water and adding food ( it swings out on the side of the cage) is brilliant!!  the metal is a nice heavy gage and easy to wipe and keep clean. Our bird enjoys his large cage and like his play area on top.  I also like that they supply you 4 metal containers so you have food and water inside the cage and food and water on their little play area on top.  the wheels make it easy to move around the room if you want to change it up for your feathered friend. lastly, the metal covering around the cage at the bottom is a game changer in keeping the floor clean.  Well worth the money, our cockatiel loves it. This cage is very sturdy, however it took three people, vice grips and a hammer to get the pieces to line up to the holes. Also the small piece in the last photo that is to prevent the tray from going forward does not latch in place. I got this cage for my sun conure. He loves it I love it, very well-made easy to put together.  One panel was damaged needed to be replaced. The lady at preview was very helpful did not require me to send a copy of invoice etc. because I only have an iPhone no computer or printer. I prefer to buy only preview Hendrix birdcages I have two And the quality can\u2019t be beat. The, Prevue Hendryx 3151C  Wrought Iron Select Bird Cage, is an aviary for the pair of birds I have.  I purchased it in their Chalk White color which blends in well with the surroundings.  The birds have been happy, not so with a regular-sized bird cage even though they were out of the smaller one more than they were in (I felt sorry for them not being able to stretch their wings)  With the aviary, I let them out once a day but then they return to it after a couple hours of flitting about. Pain in the arse to put together, but I did it alone so not that bad... took me maybe just under, if not, an hour to do. Read the instructions, as you'll think you are missing pieces and can easily slide the doors in backwards. Otherwise, a great product for the price point! This cage was fairly easy to build by myself but at some point an extra pair of hands is needed. The cage is gorgeous and sturdy and just CLEARLY good quality. The price was worth the product and I am SOLD on this brand. 1 / Awesome price:  Found almost identical cage(s) costing upwards of $125.00 more. I should have looked at the dimensions, but it is a large cage and my conure has enough room for her and plenty of toys. The dishes are big enough so she loves to bathe in the water. She also loves the top and it is roomy enough for her. I love the ease of cleaning the catch trays. The cage is made of metal so perfect for a parrot who likes to chew on everything. If I decide on a bigger cage I will go with this brand. My 2 Green Cheek Conures love the cage they spend most of their time on top playing or looking outside and go inside the cage to sleep on their own. The only complicated thing to put together was the seed guards because they were bent had to fix. Total time to assemble 30 minutes. Some of the holes were not all the way drilled either so had to get a drill but for the price a quality of cage. Ease of cleaning. It's easy to wheel outside so my birds get some sunshine.Same cage at Petmart I almost bought $300. I like I could feed the birds in the play area also I bought the 18x18  This cage was easy to assemble, the wire used on this cage is heavy-duty. Everything about this cage is great, except for the welds, they over grinded all the welds. ", "This is the 4th cage I have bought  All my birds are happy and have more room We bought this for our Conjure Jengo and he loves it! It's large enough for him to play and move around, yet it's safe enough so that he can't bite anyone when he's being a bad boy! He loves loves loves playing on the top and I love that the sides catch all of his poopies! It rolls around, so if I need to move him I can and it looks sooo cool! Everyones like WOW...cool cage! The cage is very high quality,  but we were disappointed in how it was packaged and shipped.  It came in 2 boxes strapped together,  which was awkward and dropped multiple times by UPS.  It is too heavy for any driver to carry.  It should have been shipped in two to three separate packages.  It was bent and scratched.  We were able to repair,  but very disappointed about how it arrived. Very nice size, more than big enough for my quaker. He cannot get out, due to very smart locking mechanisms, and food and water is easily reached from the side. Easy to clean, just roll it outside, remove paper liner and trays and hose off. Came with a small brush and bottle of paint for touch ups, which it did need in 2 places when it arrived. Was very difficult to assemble, need at least 4 hands Some of the parts don't fit together, and we had to use a hammer to shape and force certain parts to link together. Otherwise, decent cage, slightly expensive since it was a little bit smaller than imagined. Should buy if you're on a budget and looking for a decent cage. Color and finish is nice, as pictured. We had to bend the ladder at the top too, otherwise it wouldn't fit into all of the holes. I bought this cage for our Green Cheek Conure. So far, this cage has treated us well. A lot of reviews said that the paint chipped while putting it together, but we were careful and didnt see any chipping (knock on wood). Very affordable cage with useful features. Would recommend! Item arrived with all but two of the tie wraps busted. A number of items were bent but most could be repaired easily. The \"skirts\" were all bent but rather than fool with them I left them off...I mean, the seed is on these or the plastic office mat we placed below the cage so what's the diff. The price of $230 is great for a cage of this size particularly with free shipping. Assembly is straight forward. Do not overly tighten the lower panels until the side panels are popped in. Really a slick design. The whole main cage is held together with about 8 screws! The screw count in the instruction inventory is wrong and I actually had extras. Be careful which way those side panels face and which is the top (instructions are little help here). Rollers make cage movement really easy. Only two perches meant a couple hours in the wood shop making 8 more. From unpacking to completed assembly and clean-up took about two hours with just me on the job. Awesome, pleasant color should go with about any interior decor. The drawer size is perfect for dropping in a \"thrifty nickel\" newspaper sheet. Latches that hold food/water cups are worthless and irritating. Cups hang off level. Main door latch and back-up safety tab is a great design (our parrot is quite adept at opening cage doors....this time he will fail!). An impressive cage that would have netted a 5 star if so many items were not bent or dented. Purchased this in pewter, which looks white-gray in person. Feels sturdy and substantial. The cage did have some chips but it is near impossible not to with painted wrought iron. (And it does come with a little bottle of touch-up paint.) I love this cage! It was fairly easy to assemble, just make sure to carefully read the directions. I was afraid it wouldn't be big enough for my Quaker parrot but it really does have a lot of space! I also really like the play area at top. Overall it is just what I was looking for and I am completely satisfied. I only received parts of the cage.  The box was labeled box 2 of 2.  There was no box 1 of 2!  I\u2019m bummed because it looked great and had a great price.  Amazon gave me the option to order again or return, and I returned it because of timing reasons.  What I did receive looked great and good quality. ", "This cage was a great value for the price! I purchased this item a little hesitant after seeing some reviews stating the cage arrived in poor condition, but I seemed to have lucked out: Everything arrived looking brand-new, and while the side cage pieces were slightly warped, they straightened out as soon as I put the cage together. Will definitely be buying again! We have this cage in white for a few months and recently purchased  a larger brown one.  They are a beautiful addition to our living room.  We found the directions easy to follow and had them up is a short time.  At the start it was different to have the bars horizontal on two sides and vertical on the other.  However, it did not take long for our cockatiel to learn how much fun it is to slide down the vertical bars.  The doors to get to the food are great and the seed guards and finish make them easy to clean.  We did have a problem with the brown cage but the company took care of it easily, quickly,and  above our expectations.  If we ever get another bird, we will be sure to purchase another of these. I had been meaning to get a new cage for a while and this one was one of the cheapest. It arrived in perfect condition and really was not that difficult to set up, it took maybe 45 minutes. I included a picture of the cage directly after setup (before it is stuffed with bird toys). I didn\u2019t put the seed catchers on. For my conure I feel it is the perfect size. If you have a bird larger than a green cheek conure I would recommend maybe getting the next size up. Good cage. Decided not to use the guard around bottom. Husband had no problem putting it together. Bought a used like new cage. It was good enough BUT hated getting suckered on the cost...especially used. No one answers when you call Prevue, there is no where on Amazon to report the problem, you are directed to a link and you fill in your name.  I can't keep a bird in this broken cage that cost me over $400! I love this cage and so does my bird!! My local pet store wanted double the price for this exact model.. I\u2019ve had it for almost a year now and it\u2019s still perfect! Very very sturdy and I love that it has wheels Wasn't the easiest to assemble the terrible directions, but got together in about 45 minutes. Two of the pieces that go in the bottom of the legs to attach wheels were broken. Contacted customer service several days ago and they still have not responded. Conure loves it!  A few pieces were slightly bent from shipping, but we were able to bend them back into place.  Color is exactly as pictured. Quality is good and was easy to assemble. This is a perfect size cage for a small parrot. I was very happy with the bird cage. I wanted the old model with the arched ladder as pictured and got it (wasn't expecting it). Most companies selling Prevue cages are using the old stock photos shown with the cool arched ladder but are fulfilling orders with the lame and ugly new single straight front ladder design. The arched ladder design has been discontinued by Prevue. I imagine as soon as old stock is depleted Amazon will begin shipping the new model without updating images. This probably does not matter to most people but i have several of the same cage and wanted them all to match. I love this cage, and so does my bird.  It was easier to put together than I thought it would be.  It's sturdy and has some nice features like the doors for food and water access and wheels, so I can move it around easily.  It also comes with a little bottle of paint and a brush,  but I didn't see any chipping and there were no missing parts. ", "Great cage. I have two of these. Great value for the money. Don\u2019t buy the cheaper versions even though they look similar. They are not. The quality on this one is the best. Took about 30 mins to assemble. This is the perfect cage for a quaker parrot. I would also use this for a cockatiel size bird. I would not put two birds in this size cage. I love the food and water bowl access from the outside of the cage. My guy does not like my going in his house. The skirt does collect most of the mess. If the bird is on the door and its open at a 90 degree angle the poop will hit the floor. It is easy to clean and maintain. Came with a piece of iron missing from the bottom that I just used a zip tie to connect. A little aggravated about that, but I wanted to get my bird moved over instead of getting this shipped back. The box is heavy. A little smaller than I thought it would be, but I should have looked at the dimensions better. Cage is sturdy, and I don't have to worry about my cats getting at my conure, or better my conure getting at the cats. He seems to really like it. Put it together by myself. Went up fine. Cage is heavy duty and easy to put together. All items came, no issues with delivery, same as the one sold in local pet stores and much cheaper. Bars do not bed easily and is a great size for my conure, and Lory. (I have 2 seperate Cages) I got the cage fairly quickly, but the cage came damaged and bent in multiple places. The edges were terribly welded and shaped, a lot of the screws wouldn't even fit in and the guards along the sides of the cage came broken so they barely fit on. I reiterate, it came broken in multiple places, and was nearly impossible to put together because of that. Spend a little extra cash and get something that was built like it was meant to function. Difficult to put together, didn't come with all of the parts, the seed catching tray doesn't fit onto the cage properly, and my Timneh African Grey almost lost a toe on the top play area. There are gaps in the metal where the wood perch attaches on the top play area. My TAG got his toenail caught and his foot thoroughly twisted before we could get him lose. On top of all of this, the cage is made in CHINA. I couldn't tell that until the box arrived. DON\"T BUY. This is a great cage. Comes with a play area, seed guard and excellent door latches. The bowls they bring for food and water are not optimal of you have a very active mischievous bird like mine. It's very spacious so there is room for toys, ladders and different perches. The only concern I had putting it together was the cage felt slightly off center so every time something has to be inserted it was a little problematic I'm not sure if the cage was like this or if it got like that from shipment. Overall its a good cage for it's value. I love this cage, but some of the bars were bent, paint was rubbed off, and both pans were bent. Sturdy/stable, roomy, clean, and low maintenance if you can keep up with it.. Cleaning out the cracks is a bit of a pain, I get it out of one crack and it just seems to slip into another. I have a Quaker (the renowned escape artists) who hasn't broken out yet. Though I did find one edge slip out. It only came with half of the instructions but my dad helped me figure it out and put it together. You definitely need more than one person to put it together. It looks just like the photo. Arrived packaged well and undamaged . Clear instructions and all pieces including Allen wrench . My teen son and I started the process of construction . It could be done alone but was very easy with two . We set up the first stage then I had to leave to take younger son to soccer . We were back in and hour and my son had put it all together ! Just fantastic . Very sturdy very well made very attractive ! Lots of room inside and great play deck on top ! Our conure loves it . Very happy ! ", "Product is sort of a pain to put together and several pieces were bent. A few screws were stripped but overall it\u2019s a good product. I bought it for my two parakeets and they love the space. I love how the cage is designed to catch seeds so they don\u2019t go all over the floor. The birds live the top play area too. It looks nice, I would buy it again. I'm very pleased with this cage and so is my Yellow Sided Green Cheek Conure. The Amazon price is very impressive and especially when compared to the well known chain @ $354.99 and close to 3xs when compared to our local privately owned pet store. I opened the package as soon as it arrived (1-day shipping @ $3.99 with prime) and immediately put it together which took approximately 20 min.  I prepared myself for major problems after reading some of the reviews, but assembly was a breeze. Instructions were both easy to read and easy to follow, until I got to the cagetop playstand & corner seed guards. It is at this point that you may need to exercise a bit more patience and rely on a little intuition (use the picture as a guide). Once the cage is fully assembled it is beautiful and works very well to my surprise. I half way expected this cage to be inferior to the ones that we've seen in stores, but the inexpensive price does not mean that its cheaper in quality and that was a very nice bonus. Got a great deal on this cage, it's a little expensive but we'll worth it. The cage is huge and my parrot loves it. The playground on top is an added bonus. You can buy a cheaper cage but why risk it? The product shipped with the box in perfect condition, but the parts inside were bent and I had to order a new piece before I could assemble it. The part I received as a replacement was the wrong color, but I didn't want to wait another 5+ days for the correct part to order. The cage was also fairly hard to assemble due to the bent parts. I had an exceptionally hard time assembling the skirting around the cage. I had to bend parts back to get it to fit together and even still it doesn't sit around the cage quite right. Overall it works, but the hard time I had with broken parts and assembly will make me choose a different product in the future. Was really surprised on how fast I received this cage. Packing was very good, only minor scratches. Comes with small bottle of paint and brush for touch ups. Went together very easily. Perfect size for a small parrot. Great value for the price. My 3 month old 'tiel surprised me by loving and exploring it immediately.  He is so happy!  This cage is incredibly sturdy and was packed so well and so carefully...well, I've never ever seen something packed so well.  Not difficult to.put together, just follow directions.  So happy I got it.  Mine is in pewter color, so glad I decided on this instead of black or white or sage. Although box was pretty torn up on delivery, everything was there and in good condition inside. Easy to put together, was pleased to find touch up paint in case it had any scratches. which it didn't. Definitely recommend Dimensions are a bit misleading online I thought, measurements include the playpen to the top from the bottom so consider this when deciding your size. I seen this exact cage in a pet store for $249.00 and saved $125.00 thru Amazon.  Great deal!  It is perfect for our Meyers parrot Casey, her old cage was from 1999 and was due for a new one so I decided to downsize.  It was pretty easy to put together and will go up in a snap with a second person.  My grand daughter assisted me and she read directions and directed the whole process.  Sturdy cage and easy to clean. I added stone perches and some toys, Casey adjusted well! Very well packaged, arrived on time, but the instructions could have been better. My son and I ordered this while out of town so it would be at the house when we returned. It was shipped and arrived on time; however, it was the wrong color.  Unfortunately, my son's dad had put it together (not knowing it was the wrong color) by the time we arrived home so we are stuck with a weird green cage and not the black cage ordered. ", "Came on time as described. You can't beat the convenience of having things delivered to your door wishing 2 days. I was able to have the cage set up and ready for my Goffins cockatoo. This cage is the perfect size for him. He's had larger cages before and prefers a cage of this size. Always a good isles to give your bird the biggest cage you can afford and space will allow. Very easy to assemble. I have a larger version of basically the same cage from a different manufacturer and this was much easier to assemble. The cage itself is a good size (I purchased mine for a CAG).  The directions for putting the cage together are horrendous, and lack any detail at all, it's mostly a \"lets see if this is going to work, ooops, ok, lets try it this way). My cage arrived on time, but when I finally got around to putting it together, I noticed that the sides were bent, the seed skirt had bent places, and there were several areas that had paint chipped off. When the cage arrived the bottle of touch up paint had leaked on one of the food bowls. The odor was very strong so I didn't feel comfortable having the bowl near my bird. I contacted the manufacturer and they replaced the bowl that had paint on it and also sent a new bottle of touch up paint. This is the most awesome birdcage ever!  It is very well made and has plenty of room for my green cheek conure.  Rio spends a lot of time in her cage due to her excessive biting so I wanted something large in case she had to stay in it 24/7.  She sleeps in it in the kitchen at night and then we wheel her into the living room during the day so she can watch TV and the dog. I received this today and almost left it for my husband to put together, but my curiosity got the best of me. I unpacked it and with all the pieces scattered on my living room, I wondered, \"what in the heck did I get myself into?\" to my surprise (and my husband's) I put this cage together by myself, in a matter of about 40 minutes. it's surprisingly simple and self explanatory. idk what all the fuss was about with unclear instructions, etc... if I can do it, anybody can! the only con I have is the U bar on the top playground part that holds the food and water bowls and the perch did not fit together well and when screwed down, was lopsided. being a perfectionist, my husband did some bending and twisting of the U bar and straightened it out for me. overall, simple to put together, nice size for small to possibly medium bird. i will be picking my indian ringneck up in a couple of days so i can't give an opionion of how well it fits my bird until i bring him home. I'm writing a review a couple years later. I got it for my green cheek conure and he still loves it. Even the cockatiels love his cage. missing half of the cage! only box 1 of 2 arrived. and box was damaged so bent and missing paint in places. the top, bottom, nut and bolts as well as bowls perch (accessories) missing! pretty frustrated by this! We have both the smaller white cage and recently purchased brown one.  They are a beautiful addition to our living room.  We found the directions easy to follow and had them up is a short time.  At the start it was different to have the bars horizontal on two sides and vertical on the other.  However, it did not take long for our cockatiel to learn how much fun it is to slide down the vertical bars.  The doors to get to the food are great and the seed guards and finish make them easy to clean.  We did have a problem with the brown cage but the company took care of it easily, quickly,and  above our expectations.  If we ever get another bird, we will be sure to purchase another of these. This cage went together very easily (though I have had other cages so I had an idea of how to assemble it).  I got it as a second cage for my Congo African Grey ... one where he could perch and eat when we are home. I don't think I'd recommend it as an ONLY cage for a CAG due to its smaller size, but it works great as a second cage that I can wheel outside onto the deck or from room to room in the house. ", "I bought the 18 x 18 x 57 size. It will be fine with one bird, but I should have bought the bigger cage for my Pineapple Conure. It was easy to put together, but some of the parts were somewhat bent, which didn\u2019t hinder putting it together. I had it put together in less than an hour with the help of another person. So I read all the bad reviews and though on no what did I buy! I was very happy one bar was bent alittle bent back no problem! Study! I got the 30 inch perfect for my African grey Timneh! This cage is perfect for my Matilda! She's very confortable in it, with plenty of room for all her stuff. Came in with a few minor bends, that's why the 4 stars intead of 5. Nothing the right tools, and a handy hubby, can't fix. ;) Nice cage. On the initial set-up, it's difficult to get toys in because there's not much access. I did not put on the seed catchers, even with round corners it hurts when bumping into it. I really like the cover over the door. If the latch comes open, the door stays closed. I really like this cage!! So much better than the last one I had for my bird- because of the design and it just looks so much nicer than a lot of white plastic like cages out there. The size is perfect for my Senegal parrot. The only reason I am taking one star off is because of the time it took for me to build it but I am not savvy in that area. If you are then you will love this cage. Really happy with my purchase though! Absolutely amazing!!! It was easy to put together took me about 30 mins which isn\u2019t bad being that I did it alone. The guards on the sides do work which was something I questioned when purchasing. My Blue Crown Conure is really enjoying this cage!!!  She looks like she is in a hotel now!!!  It is a very nice cage and the price is great.  Only complaint I may have is that in some places like the seed guard is bent some and one of the back bars, but not bad.  One thing I really like about it is that the poop comes off easily with the type of finish this cage has on it.  I also like the fact it has wheels to be able to move it and also love the playtop. I have had these cages before and love them--I am so pleased Amazon has them at this wonderful price.  They are well-designed for security and cleaning, the powder coating is bird-safe, and they are really easy to assemble.  I assembled it alone (senior woman) in 45 minutes without the shields which I don't use. Packing is great. I wouldn't buy anything else for conures or similar-sized birds. Excellent cage! Very happy with it. We received it much sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise. My son wanted this for his new cockatiel we will be bringing him in a couple days. The quality is great and the cage is so easy to build. My 13 yr ols son build it by himself. I highly recommend this cage. We love this cage for our Caique Parrot.  It's a great size for her to be active, & it has plenty of room for multiple toys and her cozy bedtime hut. ", "wrong colour was sent have no use for it look very dark Very nice cage for my conure. The grey is a pretty color. I bought the coco color before, both colors are lovely.  Fast shipping. As usual, Prevue has an awesome cage to suit any need.  I bought this for my quaker parrot, and he loves it as much as I do.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I definitely recommend Prevue's cages.  Some may think that this cage is a little small for a quaker, but she hardly spends any time inside of it.  Only night time, for sleeping, and for when I have to leave the house to run an errand.  The rest of the time, she's out on top, playing. The color is beautiful and we saved so much assembling ourselves instead of buying a cage from the pet store. The size and durability is just what we wanted and we can see this lasting for many years. It even came with a small bottle of touch up paint I will be keeping for later. Very happy with this purchase! Love this cage. Second one I purchased. Easy to assemble with the exception of one of the screws would not go in because it was not aligned properly but other than that no issues. I bought this cage for black headed caique it really takes two to put together but put that aside because it is a very high quality cage. It\u2019s thoughtfully made I saw this cage at Petsmart and thought about getting it. Then I found out that I could get it shipped from Amazon. I had it for a few days before deciding to put it together. I had read a previous review that gave it 4 starts minus 1 because the instructions on putting it together was not that great. I agree they were not the best instructions but, only took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I just finished putting it together and am impressed with the quality of the cage (I'm sorry HOME). I have it next to the old cage so Mango (The bird will be used to it). This is such a high quality cage.  We have a 30 yr old African grey and she loves this as one of her many houses.  It is small but she's only in there to eat and sleep.  She has other cages and play stations scattered around inside and out.  Yes, she's demanding\ud83d\ude03.  This cage is first class.  Extremely sturdy and very good looking.  It took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together.  Highly recommend. DO NOT OPEN the little STYROFOAM BOX enclosed with the tools!  It will EXPLODE PERMANENT PAINT STAINS all over your carpet!  There is no label on the box to let you know what is inside, so hopefully you read this review before you are stuck with blue stains all over your white carpet with no hopes of removal despite trying carpet cleaner and trick in the book.  It didn't help that the paint bottle inside the little box was already broken too, so opening the tape off the styrofoam just ruined any former enthusiasm for the product. easy to assemble, product as described. fair size for my conure although I would buy a bigger size but I can't complain. beautiful design it has everything that my sun conure needs. overall happy but I would advise if you have a sun conure buy the next bigger size thats all. this size its not bad ", "Solid cage, but came damaged.  Still able to use.  contacted manufacturer and they were quick to respond, but overall did not offer any workable solutions. The cage is a good size and arrived quickly. I was exceptionally pleased with the sturdiness of the cage in general. It was exactly what I needed and I was fortunate to find it at a great cost. It even comes with touch-up paint should it ever be needed. My Pineapple Conure is a king in this cage it is huge and he will thrive in it and the playtop, how fun too! Great cage! I purchased this cage for two cockatiels and have since added a 3rd 'tiel.  They all live happily in it.  I'm a petite single woman and was able to put it together just fine.  We haven't really used the play top much; maybe in time we will.  You definitely get what you see.  Also love the coco brown color!  Very pretty!  No regrets! Perfect home for our Conure. Easy to assemble and not too large. More perches are needed. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that the latch broke after about 2 weeks. However, Prevue support was great as a new latch assembly arrived after a week no questions asked. Good job. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a classy home for their conure without breaking the bank. We like the rollers and how sturdy the cage is.  We had to buy two extra perches. Love it, & so does my parrot. I\u2019ve had this cage for coming up on a year now and I can tell you it have been wonderful for my Quaker parrot. It\u2019s strong, sturdy and secure, and very high quality. Like the title says, I absolutely love love love this cage!  It\u02bbs a very sturdy cage.  It\u02bbs a very well built, great quality product.  For the price you really can\u02bbt go wrong.  I bought it for my cockatiel and he absolutely loves it!  I did find that the seed guard does take up a lot more space when trying to find a good place to set it up so I ended up taking them off.  Luckily, they were easy to remove.  A+ for making it easy! ", "I purchased this Prevue 3154 large parrot cage, and also a Prevue 5152 small parrot cage, both from Amazon itself. The manufacturer should be embarrassed by the lack of proper directions as to how to put this cage together.  Thankfully, if you go to YouTube and put in the model number there's a video of how to put it together.  Without the video, I wouldn't have been able to figure it out.  It's a nice cage once it's assembled, but there's no excuse for the bad directions that are included with it. has held up well and my african grey loves it This cage is really really well built. Easy to clean. And looks nice. I\u2019m glad I picked this one. And am very happy with it Arrived in great shape. Perfect color and blends into the room without taking it over. Perfect for sun conure. Had to return it due to a manufacturing (welding) defect. Once the production lot that ours was manufactured with is gone I would consider ordering this cage again as a satellite cage for our two cockatiels. Perfect and beautiful for my Bird, Delwyn.  She loves it and she has a lot of room to move around.  The shipping was fast even though I only did standard shipping. The color is a little darker in person than what you see on here but still very cool.  The instructions were odd but my family too from my hands and put it together.  I didn't even get to help because they were more excited about it than I was. Now Delwyn has all the room to be her birdy self. The cage was very poor quality. 1) welded bars that were poorly welded and looked very crooked, 2) paint not evenly coated and lots of drip marks, 3) food cover knobs where too long and I couldn't close the food door so I had to use a twist tie, 4) one of the wooden perches was missing, 5) in shipment the touch-up paint exploded all over the instructions and food bowls 5) paint so uneven, that I could see unpainted places, and seemed uncured in some spots. So easy to clean and perfect in every way for my cockatiels. You just have to be careful when assembling because the paint can chip if you\u2019re not careful. I researched a lot of cages before purchasing this for my African grey that I just adopted. I am very happy with the purchase. Great quality for the price. All the reviews I read we're correct. Instructions did not make sense and small dents on cage upon arrival. Regardless, this cage is exactly what I wanted. It was actually more than what I expected for the price and my bird Jack loves it. I definitely would recommend this cage. Just make sure you have a second person to assist with assembling. ", "I really love this cage and it was just the right size for my Blue Crown Conure, He is happy with it too! Sage Green is Beautiful! The shipment came in two boxes and was easy to open and put together. The only damage was the bottom tray is dented but usable. The rest was in excellent condition This bird cage is awesome! Great price for the size. It took my 14yr old (it's his bird and he purchased with his own money) about 30 min. to assemble it. It's very sturdy and easy to move around. Visitors always ask him how much he paid for it and they always tell him what a good deal he got! Highly recommend 5 Stars***** We got this for our cockatiel, it's a great cage, well made, perfectly thought through as far as doors and locks and food bowls, etc. Yep, as others have stated, the instructions are not the best but I was able to figure it out and get it assembled. Appears to be good quality materials and the finish looks good with no runs or chips. Good size cage at a great price. The only thing if I had to pick something would be the wheels, they could have been a little better but I'm happy with it! peices were bent, the holes on some of them still had the metal cut out where the machine did not get it so i had to pry them out with a screwdriver This birdcage has served my cockatiel extremely well!  He is usually a pretty messy eater and likes to toss the seeds around all over the floor, but with the seed guard, everything gets thrown back into the bottom of the cage. The items were very badly damaged, can't return as box was destroyed as well, the top welds were not only cracked but broken off, very poor craftsmanship, I have been looking for a used cage on Craig's list for a while and they were so expensive. I decided it was worth it to spend a little more to purchase a new one and have it delivered which was free with my Amazon Prime.I did not have to drive around and then figure out how to get a cage home. I love this cage and so does my Blue Front Amazon parrot Ringo!!! He is really happy and loves the play pen on top. It is well made,the perfect size and it looks great! I am glad I picked the Coco Brown. It is neutral and blends in with any decor.  I did not find it difficult to assemble by myself. The only thing I would recommend is to buy a stronger wood branch type perch for the inside. Ringo chewed up the soft wood perch that comes with the cage the first week! Prettiest cage out there. Easy to clean and plenty of space. Nice playtop. One cage panel came damaged and the Prevue Pet Products replaced the panel within 2 weeks. Great quality. Would buy again!!! ", "The cage seems heavy enough and well made in terms of the metalwork, which I like, however the packaging for shipping was done very poorly and caused damage to many parts of the cage.  The seed catchers and the slide out trays have dents in them.  The small panels are very BADLY chipped with a lot of paint coming off of them and it looks like more will continue to chip away.  There are also small scratches, right down to the bare metal, in the paint on other pieces.  Some of the pieces have edging that has gotten bent.  Touchup paint and a small paintbrush have been included in the box, but I don't trust it...I bought a cage with a powdercoated finish for a reason - so my bird won't be able to chip paint away and get poisoned from ingesting it and by being exposed to the metal beneath the paint!  Plus, if you paint your cage, the bird will be exposed to paint fumes unless you just happen to have a spare cage while the other cage dries and off-gases its toxic fumes in a separate area. this cage is perfect for my green-cheek conure and for my small apartment.  She seems so happy every time I put her away, or on top of the cage, and the lock plus door block is perfect for keeping her from pulling a little birdie Houdini. I also appreciate having a cage skirt to catch all her little scraps and to keep the cat from trying to climb the cage. Our birdie got her wing caught between the bars and who know what would have happened to her if we were not there to rescue her. This is not an appropriate cage for Cockatiels even though the description said it was. Average quality. Some holes didn't quite line up. Spots of tan something on my white cage. Seed guards too bent to install. I will probably be looking for a different cage in the near future. Nice size for our second home. May not be the best option for a medium size parrot permanently, unless the parrot gets out to utilize the \"play\" area atop the cage. Easy to clean, nice splash guard. I love this cage! It went to gether easily, it's got a good, sturdy construction and plenty of room for multiple perches for small to mid sized parrots. My Quaker is terrified of it, but I think once he adjusts, he will be very pleased. The double locking door and side access food and water ports are excellent additions as well. Overall a steal for the price. I'd been eying this same cage for three times the price at Petco! I love this cage! It arrived on time with no damage. The material is of high quality and the color is beautiful. I was able to put it together by myself in about an hour. I was able to fit more perches and toys creating great space for a bird to play. It even came with touch up paint. I will be purchasing this cage again when I need a larger one. Easy to assemble. Looks exactly like the picture. No chips or scratches although the packaging was beat up pretty good. Packaging it better would be smart but mine turned out fine. Great Product, easy to assemble. Blue Cheek Conuer loves it! Great item.  The product took a little longer to ship, probably because it came in 2 boxes and weighed over 100 pounds.  A piece was broken, and I had to have it welded.  Amazon did not have another to send in replacement, plus to return ship it would have been too much trouble.  The Prevue company would not send a replacement part as stated in the paperwork that was sent in the box, they wanted amazon to handle the defective part by sending the whole thing back. ", "The cage is well made and stylish.  It definitely needed two people to put it together but once we managed to bang our fingers a few times we finally realized the pain was worth it.  It took a few days for my bird to get used to her new home. It a nice sturdy cage, good size. Birds happy It was fairly easy to assemble, however, the perch that goes across the cage was missing.  I contacted customer service to get a replacement and they made it so difficult to get a replacement that I just gave up and went out and bought one.  I won\u2019t buy another product from them because their customer service sucks. Great cage for my \u2018tiel. She really enjoys being on top to stretch her wings. Easy to assemble and plenty of spots to hang toys, food. I used some of that \u201cstatic cling sports wrap\u201d to cover some of the surfaces she stands . This birdcage is the perfect size for my cocketiel. The instructions were simple for assembly (though I would recommend having a partner). The only downside I can find is that the only feeders the cage will fit are the ones that are provided with the cage. Otherwise, it is perfectly roomy and the playtop is a great addition. I didn't have any problems at all it was packed well and all pieces were there.  Went together easily and is working great for my bird! Wonderful purchase!!! This same cage is just under $400 at pet stores! You also get the bonus of free shipping with Amazon!!!! We have had our Africian Grey for about 25 yrs and she adjusted really well in her new surroundings. We asked each other why we didnt make this purchase a few years back!!!! A great purchase and highly recommend!!!!!! The seed catcher does not fit well. Attachment tabs need to be longer. Otherwise it is a nice cage for our 2 Lobe birds. I'm really impressed with this cage's build quality and design!  Prior to assembly, I washed everything down with a solution of vinegar and warm water (and dried with a towel).  The assembly went smooth and is designed (for the most part) for one person to assemble. Includes is an allen wrench to use with the stainless hardware (nice plus) but I did need another person hold the skirt panels while using a wrench (or needle nose pliers) to hold the nut as threaded the hex head screw into it.  The directions are simple and I found it necessary to reference the picture of the cage to confirm assembly (easy enough to figure out).  Overall it took me 90 minutes to wash, dry, assemble, decorate and introduce my cockatiel to the new cage. Received two cages within a few days. I'm waiting for my Senegal to be weaned. It took me approximately 30 minutes to put first one together. I read some of the reviews and one recommended watching on u tube illustrating the guy put it together which made it so easy to assemble without any instructions. My husband always put things together but wanted to see how I could accomplish it. It did take more time assembling the seed guard by myself but ended putting ends together then slipping the tabs in afterwards. The second cage I put together in less time and will eventually put in a Black Caique. Great for what I need it for. ", "This is a great cage for my sun conure. Easy to clean, easy to feed, and easy to get her out. She loves the perch on top too. It was missing one part when I got the package, but Prevue Pet had it to me in a few days. Great customer service. I actually have two of these cages. I\u2019m very upset because the cage came with many dents and was bent in multiple places. You don\u2019t realize it until you\u2019ve already unboxed it and there\u2019s no way to get it back into the box to return it so you just have to live with the dents. I feel I spent a good amount of money for it to be dented and bent. Nice cage. this is heavy enough for a parrot, or large bird. finish is great, cocoa color. Plenty of room for bird , perches, and toys. Sturdy!  The pans that go around the side are very nice I owned a cage a few years ago that cut you every time you walked by due to the sharp edges!  This cage has rounded them and they are smothe in joining together!  Very nice!  Only 1 downfall that is why  I didn't give it a 5 star is the base is a lot shorter then I expected.  So I you have to bend to clean the lower pan out (not so fun with a bad back.)  But all in all it is a great cage if you don't mind the low rider effect!  LOL I love this cage, it was perfect for my son's sun conure . Was mostly easy to put together, and I'm not good with building anything . Had a couple of things slightly  bent but not enough to cause a problem. It had a couple of spots where the paint was scratched but it wasn't enough to bother me . The birds seem to love it too. Great quality bird cage. I bought one for a sunconure and a second for a quaker. It\u2019s the perfect size. Impossible for parrots to escape when locked and good and water trays are easy to take out to clean food and water. Very good cage!  Our African Grey adjusted to this new cage almost immediately, and he seems to love it!  The crumb catchers on the side are a bit flimsy and the edges of the panels are rather sharp, so we chose not to use them.  We are impressed by the sturdiness of the cage itself, and would recommend it. Fantastic cage for the money.  Great price.  Super easy to put together even for a 75 year old woman.  I have always liked Preview cages in the past.  This time I decided to see if I could save myself a little money by putting it together by myself. The package was expertly wrapped and got here in super condition.  I had the cage together in less than two hours.  Now I have saved a bit of money for some bird toys. Thanks so much. Excellent cage for money. Went to a bird shop and this excact cage was more then double in price and didn\u2019t even have the top ladder and perch. Excellent quality, great size and easy to out together. None ", "Great cages for my conures.  Ordered different cages first for twice the money and half the quality!  They were poorly packed and bent. These cages were very well packaged and easy to assemble with the help of my grandson.  Love them. My only complaint is that they are not as tall as I would have liked but even that is not so bad. If you haven't upgraded your bird cage from the Petsmart variety-BUY THIS NOW!!! It's amazing! I have two cockatiels and they are loving it. It's easy to clean. I don't use the food dishes provided because I have others, but the cages design let's you use a variety of perches and configurations so I can use the dishes I have. It's also great to have the play top I can give them a bath on top and it's so much easier (they can stretch out). I love this cage and I wish I splurged for it earlier. First the good--this cage is perfectly sized for an Amazon or Grey, and was generally easy enough to assemble (although there is zero direction as to which way panels face, likely leading to panels being assembled backwards and having to be redone).  The paper trays slide easily and the play stand is adequate. I would give it 5 stars because our bird absolutely loves the cage, but the build instructions were very vague. Me compr\u00e9 esta jaula la de 18x18x57 para un Cockatiel la verdad me encanto! Muy f\u00e1cil de armar \ud83d\udc4clo \u00fanico que me arrepiento es el tama\u00f1o que eleg\u00ed \ud83d\ude22 se me hace muy chiquita. Pero se que es mi culpa \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f No lo visualice asta que la arm\u00e9 yo recomendar\u00eda el siguiente tama\u00f1o para que despu\u00e9s no se sientan como yo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f None This was very easy to assemble and it is exactly as expected. I had to remove the food and water bowls up top because my bird can lift out the bowls and throw them. But other than that, it\u2019s perfect. Great bird cage, not to hard to put together and all of the pieces were there.  Good quality too :-) I bought this for a pair of Parakeets. It's very nice and well made.  It doesn't take up much room but does sit a little low so you have to stoop over to say good morning.  If I were going to put a Cockatiel or larger however, I would get the next size up that Prevue makes just like this one.  I do like it very much.  It's very attractive in my office. This is an incredible cage, well built, roomy and very easy to assemble. Looks gorgeous in my living room. My indianringneck has plenty of space. Really happy about this purchase. I bought this and had to immediately return it.  The seed catcher was bent beyond use.  The main connector broke, and the cage could not be put together.  It was disappointing, and I cancelled the purchase of my bird since I didn\u2019t have a usable cage. ", "No shipping issues with damage as in some other reviews. The instructions could be better but I built it with little difficulty. FYI, the seed shields looks bent but that is by design. it all assembles rather easily. The birds love the roominess and the seeds no longer scatter on the floor like the smaller cage. They also like the stick on top. Highly recommended if you have the room. This is a great cage. We're using it for our eclectus parrot. It could be a bit bigger, but it is very good quality! Our bird climbs all over the inside and the outside and everything has held up wonderfully! I especially love how easy it is to access the inside food and water bowls. For what the cage is, it works. Once assembled this is a sturdy cage and easy to clean. I ordered 2 of these cages for my 2 green cheek conures that I have. So far they both are enjoying the play top gym quite a bit. My only negative comment about this product was the assembly. Some of the side panels were warped from shipping/packaging. It took a lot of tinkering around with to \"reshape\" parts of the product, though I will say you can't tell the struggle that went on when looking at the finished product! Some pieces were bent! Great cage! My bird loves it. I have a green cheek conure and she loves having her !morning berries up on the top perch ontop of the cage. It's super easy to clean. It was a bit smaller than I originally expected but still plenty of room inside. We had to add a bunch of custom perches because it only comes with 1 but other than that, we love the cage. I am very pleased with the quality of the cage. The assembly directions are sparse, but the process was straightforward, and I was able to put the cage together by myself (though having another set of hands would have sped up the process. Our green-cheek conure loves the cage and stand. I love it, my bird was a little intimidated at first by this big huge thing, but he's warming up to it. It was relatively easy to assemble, I did it myself. I love the seed catcher and it is also a very attractive cage and looks good in the house. What a bargain. Also I love how the bottom tray has bars around it. My bird will some times go to the bottom tray and eat the dropped food. I don't like that because the food is mixed in with the bird poop and can't be healthy. But now he can't get to the discarded food. I love that a lot. I can't believe I got such a great cage at this price. I'm very satisfied. Thank you. It's easy to clean and move a little smaller than I expected but still very happy with this purchase. I had a cage like this a few years ago, for which I paid about $400 at a local store. The bird I had at the time died, and I sold the cage for about $250. Plenty of room and well constructed. Doubles as a play yard on top. ", "nice cage...my african grey has plenty of room.  easy to assemble too. could use two people though but able to do it alone. pretty clor and nice playtop. Prevue has some of the best bird housing on the market. This our second purchase from Prevue and I highly recommend their products.  Yes, it takes a little time to put together, be patient, lay out all the parts first, and then follow the detailed instruction.  This unit, (3152BLK) took me 20 minutes by myself, however a buddy's help is always more fun. Our Quaker loves this cage and so do we!! It\u2019s perfect and well made and adorable as heck! I bought two, one for my Sun Conure and Jenday Conure. It took a couple of weeks for them to get use to it, now the love it. The cages are solid, sturdy and easy to clean. This cage is perfect for my sun conure, easy to put together. Easier with two people but could be done with just one person. Only problem I had was one of the bars for the top was bent a little. The cage trays were slightly bent out of shape upon delivery.  The cage is quite deep which is nice, but there are no doors on the back of the cage.  Affixing perches and toys is somewhat difficult without having access to the back of the cage.  I did not put the playpen on the top of the cage in order to keep more light filtering in from the top.  The food dishes are quite large, this cage is probably best used for a medium sized parrot.  The food dishes are too big for a cocktail or smaller parrot species. Got a whole lot more then I expected. The play yard on top has a tray under it, so you can remove all the litter when they go back in the cage. All of the parts are sturdy and feeding bowls are so easy to fill. has escacpe proof door which is a big plus for me as my african gray is an escape artist. The only thing if you are buying for a gray or larger you will need to purchase larger perches the ones that come with it are small diameter. All in All I would highly recommend this cage. I love the cage, i ordered the 36 x 24 x 66 i love the design and overall cage, the only thing i hate was how bent up some of the parts were. The shipping could have been handled better. its a shame so many parts were bent up. Got this in white and love it. It moves nicely on bumpy tile. I got it for my cockatiel and it\u2019s perfect for him Its a Great Cage! Very easy to put together and didn't need the instructions to do so! The Only Draw back is the Vertical bars with less horizontal bars! My Parrot is trying to get use to hanging on to the bars and gets a little freaked out! As we all know they have super beaks and use them to climb! Love the seed guard My floors stay clean!!!!! ", "This was a great product and came fast. Worked great and exactly how I wanted it. Very Happy :) Pain to put together but good cage Love this cage. Fits perfectly in our living room. The catch-all tray around the base collects everything she attempts to throw out. She loves to sit on top the open door and on top the cage. I love that it has wheels and is light weight so I can move it to vacuum. I have a sun conure who is a messy eater and pooper-  He spends a lot of time on the outside of his cage-  with my old cage there was food all over the floor and I was always cleaning up poop.  This cages seemed enormous when we first put it together but he has gotten used to it.  The seed/poop catcher is a god send and with the play top/tray the food stays on the tray or in the catchers. Disappointed some of the parts were bent. The seed catcher doesn't seem to be able to allow to be tightened at the bottom, however it still does the job. The cage looks nice and the directions for assembly were easy to follow. 3 stars because they could have prepared it for shipment better to avoid damage. Best cage I have purchased. Great for my African Grey. I ordered this in sage green. Really nice. Went together easily. Only problem I had was I assembled it with the feed dish side upside down, The instructions didn't say anything about which side up. Found my mistake when the food dish doors wouldn't lock but easily fixed. Only complaint I have really isn't a complaint. The instructions said to put the two shallow dishes on the top playground but all four of my dishes are the same size. They're fine. I'm happy. Best cage out there. I have 2 conures in this one. The size is perfect. Nice cage, easy assembly.  It's on the small size for an Amazon or other mid-sized parrot, but if they spend a lot of time outside the cage, it's fine.  Otherwise, it's best sized for cockatiels or lovebirds. I was a little concerned (ok, a lot concerned) about having to put this cage together but I figured if worse came to worse, I'd ask my son to come over and help me.  He's much better about doing that kind of stuff, but I don't believe he could have done it any easier or faster than I did. ", "This is a great cage and it\u2019s easy to clean! Everything is very sturdy! My only complaint is that my birds can\u2019t get from inside to the play top on their own. But I\u2019m sure I could figure something out. Easy set up, very hard on your own though i suggest you get someone to help you. The cage is sturdy, my quaker loves it and he especially loves the top where he can eat and play. The doors that open for the food trays are very useful because in the old cage he would fly out as soon as i opened the cage. Great price and size. Love the playpen on top, pull out tray is a a good distance from the bottom grating. All around good cage, only draw back is some of the screws don't fit because not all the holes aren't lined up and the paint is a lil sloppy. Black cap conure loves it. I'm very happy with this cage. I needed something small for my bedroom for him to hangout on when we're upstairs. He took to it right away exploring the playtop. It's well made and nice looking. And my Grey is happy with it as well. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Didn\u2019t think I would be able to put this together as easily as I did.  We haven\u2019t adopted our birds yet but when we do, i\u2019ll post pics with them in it. Love my new birdcage and so does my cockatiel ! I put this cage together by myself while my husband was at work and it was easy but took about 45 min to do alone. Very sturdy frame and I love the large front door and the side doors for the food and water bowls. Also, the wheels make it very handy to move from room to room. I highly recommend this cage to anyone with a cockatiel or smaller bird. I just got my new prevue cage. But screw is not going in on one of the sides. (Leftside panel of the main grill to the entrance). Can u sent a replacement only for that part? I'm a new bird owner and I bought this cage after doing a fair amount of research.  The construction is solid--the color is pleasant (I got the light green) and the extra drawer under the cage top play station is good for keeping things tidy. Only potential problem looks like the seed catcher may need to be removed to clean fully...so far so good. Just love this cage.I bought it for my green cheek conure it is the perfect size.It looks nice in my living room the only problem now is to get my little birdy to sit on the top play area he is frightened of it LOL Was very easy to assemble. Looks very nice and the bird loves it. ", "Niiiiice! Love, love love for my cockatiel! No issues when it got here besides a small bend and a small chip. No biggie though. Great quality cage. Great cage ! Good size I love the pull out trays makes cleaning easier . Good cage! Good quality! Very sturdy!  A little smaller than I would have liked The cage is great! A couple of small issues. Nothing that couldn\u2019t be figured out. For the price, I can\u2019t complain. Four stars because the small imperfections and quality isn't the best. But once assembled it is sturdy. It\u2019s a bird cage, not a Tigers. It will work. Assembly was easy EXCEPT for the roof. The metal was bent so I had to get a rubber mallet to force it into place. very sturdy! Being able to slide out the trays makes cleaning a breeze! Very nice cage.  Not the fault of the cage but I would order one that opened at the top instead of having to get my bird out of the cage to place her on the top.  Still ....really nice cage.  I put  it together in about an hour.  No problem. Great to have new cages for the exotic birds, only wish there was a way to have sealed all the holes in the hollow tubes that make up the corners.  I know the holes are part of the manufacturing process, but now they make great places for bugs to get into....yuk! And it is hard to use bug sprays around exotic birds because they are so sensitive. I\u2019m giving a one star because I could not attach my playstand because the top front was missing a hole. I was speaking to customer service through prevue and after several emails they stopped replying to me. Bad customer service. Don\u2019t recommend. Plus the top grate has a bent part. ", "Easy to put together, I did it myself and it only took about a half an hour.  My eclectus loves it b/c I leave it open and he can go back and forth from the play gym on top all day. Such a great cafe for my cockatiel!  Sturdy, quality design and was easy to assemble. easy to assemble & beautiful cage- I bought 2 - Quaker & a cockatiel This cage is easy to assemble, well made and is a perfect home for a Cockatiel. Great value as well! Just as represented!  Arrived a day earlier than committed (nice)! Lot of other reviewers complained about assembly instructions..... wasn't a big deal.  I completed it by myself in about 45 minutes -- was actually working in the home office, talking on the phone etc....  I did have to redo the side panel -- had the panel with the bowls on upside down initially (lol)!  Guess if I hadn't been doing other things concurrently... would have gone a little quicker.  At any rate, Spanky (Quaker) took to this cage immediately!  Plenty of room for toys, exercising his wings, climbing, exploring, etc.  The play top is a real treat for him as well -- attached a couple of toys there -- and he has a ball!  There was a small blemish in the paint on a seed guard -- does not bother me at all.  Like the color, matches our decor well!  Very satisfied with price, fit and function. Our parrot is really happy in his new cage. We especially love the stand above the cage as this serves as a two in one and is great for our small living room. This is a great cage. I have two parakeets & they are absolutely comfortable in this cage. I leave the door open so they can fly around the house & only keep food inside so they must fly I to the cage when they are hungry. The cage takes about a half hour to put together, but well worth it. It is well made & sturdy. It's alsoeasy to clean. I wipe it down weekly with a warm paper towel It's great purchase; the cage is practical, the right size and good quality, I recommend it Cage arrived in a very timely manner in two boxes and I my oldest son put it together with no problems!  My Goffin Cockatoo absolutely loves it!  She has plenty of room to move around in it and play!  Very high quality cage and highly recommend it! Overall great product. Cage is sturdy. It was very easy to put together. Everything arrived in good condition. Only issue is that the perch for the inside of the cage isn't cut properly and does not stay steady. Everything else is really great. Would buy again. ", "This large & sturdy cockatiel cage is very well made, more than big enough for my 2 tiels, providing them ample room for all their toys, bathing and nesting areas.  They were very happy with their new home and love the play area on top!  The cage was easy for me, a petite woman, to put together, and comes in many colors. I chose a color that matches my decor perfectly!  The seed guard keeps the area as clean as possible around their cage. It rolls easily on the caster wheels, and I like the locking feature to keep them safe when my young grandson is around. This cage has all the features that I have been looking for in a new cage. Anyone looking for a quality and easy to assemble cage, I highly recommend this cage.  It came to me in perfect shape and I put it together quickly with absolutely no problems.  Quality materials and finish. This is a great bird cage. I got it as a replacement. Jax loves it as well. It is easy to clean and is simple to assembly. Fair deal This bird house is a nice size for my cockteil. Nice quality. Easy to clean. My bird is very happy in her home. This cage is very nice, I had one for my Quaker growing up; however, the wire spacing is unsafe for smaller birds like Budgies. If you LOVE this cage and want one suited for smaller (keet) sized birds search for the Prevue Park Plaza, it doesn't have a perch on top, but it has the appropriate 1/2\" spacing to keep smaller birds safe and looks just like this one!! This is a nice bird cage.  I have it set up for my conure.  It was easy to assemble.  Delivery was quick.  I like the teal color as well. This is s very nice cage but definitely the bar spacing is too wide for a cockatiel. And too much hassle for me to return it. Does anyone in SoCal want to buy from me? It's all assembled! Great cage for my Indian Ringneck parrot. The cage was well packaged and easy to put together. I had to have some help with the seed catcher, but overall very easy to assemble. Also, I like how it comes with a bottle of touch up paint and a paintbrush. I usually don't write review but this one I have to write what a good quality this cage is I assembled the entire cage in less then 40 minutes clear instructions. ", "Some parts were a little bent but easily bent back into place. Great cage, and I was able to put it together myself. This is a great cage for my African Grey...she only stays in during the night and when I leave the house for a few hours. We needed to replace the very expensive poorly made cage we got from a pet store. Exactly as expected.  I had no trouble putting it together all by myself.... I'm 5'2, barely 100lbs.... so I'd say it's pretty easy!  Looks much better with my decor, compared to the previous cage.  And Oscar seems to be enjoying it! The cage came bended,  I can even insert some of the parts because it is miss aligned,  Jesus I am disappointed I was looking forward to giving little Wilson his new cage . Now somehow I have to repackage everything and ship it back , I cannot accept this My conure loves his new cage and is quite happy in it. Very sturdy. Love it..didnt use the side catchers yet cause it made it to awkward for my space but it's just what I wanted. The sage green color goes with everything in my sunroom. Great product. It came with no damage. Great, sturdy colorful cage. Only disappointments were part of cage was bent from shipping (was able to bend it back carefully w/pliers) AND coop (food and water) cups rusted near the tops after a few weeks of use (I simply use soap and water to clean them every day). They are stainless steel, but obviously not \"stainless steel.\" Cage comes with another pair (4 in all), and I am currently looking for replacements. For future reference, they hold 12 oz and dimensions are 4 3/8 width and 1 1/2 length. Great cage. Vertical design offers a lot of flexibility. You can pretty much make it a multi level home, sort of like a three story apartment. Make sure to pimp out the the top with modifications, toys, ladders and your birdie will be in birdie heaven My conure loves his new home! He loves hanging out in the second floor. It was easy to built except for the seed guard it was a little bit tricky! ", "Our cage is so damaged. And there is no way I could pack this up and ship it back. My bird cage from Prevue Pet Products is awesome!! I looked at a local pet store and a similar cage was 499.00 instead of the 175.00 I paid. It was heavy and sturdy and easy to put together. I give it five stars. It came quickly and living in Hawaii that doesn't often happen in fact many companies will not ship to us so I was thrilled. Thanks, Adella Quality craftsmanship. Solid and attractive. I've always loved Prevue bird cages! They're wonderful quality, and worth every penny. Also, I love the sage green color! Goes great with my peach front conure. This is a great cage by design. My green cheek settled in to it quickly and loves the play top. It is very easy to clean. Mine came with a piece damaged but after emailing Prevue I received replacement parts fairly quickly. The replacement parts were slightly mismatched to the color of my cage, but no big deal. It was pretty easy to assemble. This cage was easy to put together (I did it by myself which pretty much is an amazing feat in itself)  It looks nice, has held up well for  my Quaker, and does a good job of keeping the mess inside.  It's also super easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it. My 3 Month Year Old Cocatiel Loves Her New Cage!!!! I love the quality of it and the little play area thata attached on top of the cage. I just put on the seed catcher and can say it works well. Easy to put in though it took some time. It arrived a day or 2 Early. These cages are like little bird condos and my Bird Loves it! I Highly Recommend anybody to get this cage! I've had this for a while now years I came back to give a review to let you know that nothing ever chipped bent nothing ever broke on it. Quality is very good. Best bird cage.  Love it. The cage is great. I didn't rate five stars because one screw hole was not tapped to set the screw. I was able to put it together just fine. My featherly friend now has a nice home. ", "My bird sure loves this and it gives her plenty of space. 3 stars because those wing things make it really tough to clean the cage. I took them off and the cage works much better without them and fits better in spaces. I just received my Bird Cage via UPS late this evening and had it totally assembled before 10 PM.  I was quite impressed with the ease of assembly and while the instructions are somewhat vague, they didn't seem to slow down my progress. My Cockatiel, Stormy (a Hurricane Katrina exile from New Orleans)seemed to take to it quite well. His old cage was a bit wider, but not as tall as the new one. The old one had a smaller door, a plastic bottom tray, and I had it sitting in my room atop two tables. Now, with the rollers on the new cage, I can easily roll his cage around to vac under it. I think I paid around $60.00 plus for the old cage at a pet store years ago. I'm looking forward to hearing my old feathered friend whistling to his favorite Celtic songs again.  The best attribute of this cage it no doubt, its price. I have been looking for one along this line for a long time.  For the downside, I have none, but I can see where it would be more beneficial to smaller birds. My only advise would be to take your time putting it together, don't get in a rush, take a coffee break if you have to, and your fowl will be all the better..... I ordered this cage to replace an older, 18x18\" wire cage for my maroon bellied conure. I wanted one on wheels the same size or bigger with more  room for him to play. This was relatively easy to put together with 2 people and, although the plastic anchors for the wheels were broken, Prevue replaced them within 5 days. However, when I wheeled it over to the old cage something didn't look right. In fact, after measuring, the cage proved to be only 16\" x 16\" on the outside - much smaller than advertised. The box, the directions, everything was consistent with this 3151 model. I called Prevue and the man on the phone said that they didn't make anything smaller than 18 x 18 and it must have been Amazon's fault. Give me a break. The box came sealed and clearly labeled by Prevue. It is a real pain to take apart and the boxes are gone so I guess I will give it to a local parrot rescue to use as an isolation cage since it is way to small for even a parakeet's long term home.  And the little girl who was is waiting for her Christmas parakeet will have to wait a little longer until Gordon can be moved to the new cage I just ordered. I think it's great. I don't know how anyone had problems putting this together. There is nothing wrong with the directions and this couldn't have been easier. Easy to assemble and a great addition to my decor This could be a 5 star cage if Prevue had any type of quality control.  I received 2 of these cages and there were issues with each.  The first cage had many issues.  The biggest issue being the door was not welded or aligned correctly (no way to adjust) and takes significant force to open or close it.  Many of the bars were bent on many of the panels (I was able to straighten them to a point where it is usable), the holes are not aligned correctly to attach the top of the cage; the cheap bolts provided easily strip, there are several paint chips (guess that's why they include a touch up kit in box), the playpen perch does not stay in place as the slits cut into the side of the perch are too big and the perch I received was chipped at one end and there was rusty red marks on many cage pieces. This cage is very easy to clean and very spacious This cage is just right for me and my Female Vos Eclectus. Love the lock on the door. There's no way she can raise the bar like the other cage. And cannot reach the paper at bottom of cage, because 6 in. below the grill. Looks better in my tiny apt. too. Easy to put together with 2 people. I am so pleased with this new cage.  It was fairly easy to assemble.  You may need an extra set of hands, but for the most part, easy. It even came with a tiny bottle of touch-up paint and a little paint brush, just in case you scratch it while assembling.  I just love the design of it.  I am so happy to have round bowls instead of rectangular bowls for my parrot.  It's so hard to clean out those corners!  I am thrilled with the color.  We live in a 5th wheel and the color matches our leather furniture perfectly!  So, visually, it doesn't take up as much space as a black cage.  All of the other cages I saw were black, with the exception of a couple that were available in white. I have a Yellow Nape Amazon parrot.  I know that she should have more space, but for our situation right now, this cage is perfect. It's larger than what she had. She LOVES it. She can swing and play from her toy hanging from the \"ceiling\" inside the cage, and come out and play on top. The perches that come with it are too small in diameter for her feet, so my built her new ones.  It is sturdy, the door is very secure, it is very easy to clean and I just love it. My birds loved thier new home. ", "Perfect cage for our Green Cheek Conure. Is great quality. Would recommend! :) I definitely have some issues with this cage, but at the right price, it's worth it. I managed to get mine for $70 with prime free shipping; a few days later it was listed at $170. The manufacturer sells it for $100. Awesome cage,  really well built, easy to assemble -Sun Conure loves it! Great cage. Looks great in our home. Easy to put together. Better than expected! We leave the cage door open all day so that our red bellied parrot can climb up and down from the top. great quality Bought this for senegal parrot. Well built. Perfect size. We bought this cage for our Conure.  The cage has lot of room for Pepito.  I hose it once a week and airdry outside. She loves her big girl cage! Bought it for my miniature macaw and he loved it. Will have to buy another one for my blue crown conures. Cage is great quality. Very nice looking. Didnt come with 2 perches only came with one and only came with 2 bowls and 3 bowl holders. Instructions were not included and one of the plastic pieces to attach the wheels to the cage legs was missing. This is why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. ", "Great cage. Jenday conure loves it. Room for toys and ladders. No bird seed spraying all over. Would buy again Perfect! Was able to put it together myself n my husband helped to put the seed guards, everything fit perfect n had all my supplies! Very well made and sturdy. Easy to assemble. Great cage. Absolutely perfect for my cockatiel. Only took about 30 minutes to set up, and everything was there. The corners were carefully packed and reinforced in the box, and it arrived with no problems. Love it! What a deal! Sturdy, high quality, and well constructed. My bird loves this as a night cage. Bars are strong enough for an African Grey. So easy to assemble and a beautiful cage. My Senegal loves it. Great product. It took muuuuuuch longer than expected to receive though. Beware if you need by a certain date. We were okay because we were just replacing a cage we already had. This product came with all parts, was on time, and easy to assemble.  I will not be getting any other brand of birdcage in the future.  It looks great and is high quality.  I am delighted with my purchase! We priced this cage at several places and this was the best price...but price isn't everything.  It was advertised as a cockatiel cage.  It's not.  It is a cage for a small parrot.  There is a difference. The bar spacing is the absolute maximum so wings and feet don't get caught (3/4\" vs. 1/2\") and they should be the minimum of 24\" wide (vs. 18\") cockatiels like to \"pace\" back and forth.  I didn't check all that until after the fact because it was advertised as a cage for cockatiels. ", "The good, it's a nice looking cage.  Some of the pieces were damaged on arrival, and the box was actually missing a set of screws.  As far as putting it together it's not difficult but not intuitive either.  I'll likely return this and purchase a different cage. This is a fantastic new cage that I got for my green cheek conure.  It took her a bit to get used the height, as she was in a long but low cage, before this.  But she's adapted and climbs easily, like most green cheeks.  As always, Prevue has provided a great product. It\u2019s very simple to assemble, and has ample room for my parrot. Love how solid this cage is. The green look is modern and really sharp. The only draw back was the shipper damaged the box and made some small dents/scratches. I had a previous model it finally rust out. This new one looks better, the new latches are great. Great cage for our Quaker parrot. He loves his new home and I love that he is able to hang out on top from time to time. Also, he is unable to escape like he could his last cage. Beautiful cage poor paint job\ud83d\udc4eLook closely by the light and you can see so for the price of the cage you would think the paint job would had been done alot nicer so other then the door it's a pretty cage. Our cage arrived with several missing parts. Calls to Prevue customer service (which is a voice mail) were ignored. We finally had to go to Home Depot and with the cage to find parts to make it work as our poor new bird was in a box. Don't buy from this company. Even their toys stink! I bought two of these cages....great quality and easy to put together....yes there are cheaper cages from other companies but remember \"you get what you pay for !!!\". I was a little worried by some of the other reviews, but my cage was perfect! My only complaint is that it is a little smaller than I thought it would be and the instructions to put it together SUCK. They are very vague and caused me to spend way more time than necessary getting it assembled. ", "For the price, you can't beat this!  Awesome cage! Quality Build. Assembly Directions are poor but with common sense it is pretty easy to assemble. The most difficult part of assembly are the 4 seed catcher panels-pay attention to the grooves as they are specific to each side. Very good price on Amazon compared to pet stores. I am happy with this purchase. It's pretty much as advertised.  This is a roomy, heavy-duty cage.  My Amazon parrot has a lot of space.  All the parts arrived, only a few were scratched, but not badly.  There was touch-up paint included.  Be sure to use it in a well-ventilated area, because it has a very strong smell.  I rolled the cage outside to paint it. Great bird cage! This has been perfect for my Yellow Naped Amazon. It's big enough for him to stretch out, but not so big that he gets territorial. We've had it for a couple of years now and it's still going strong! Love the look of this cage. It is a very efficient home for my bird. There were only two small problems. One, the top portion of the cage was bent a little, but not noticeable. The second issue was that the holes on the top perch were not completely open and we can't store one of the feeding dishes up there. It was easy to put together. (Update) After finally recieving my bird cage 4 days late I am Happy to say that it was worth the wait this is a excellent bird cage and it was very easy to put together! Thanks so much for a great cage and its from my hometown Chicago which makes it a plus! It looks great on picture but when moving it it\u2019s quite flimsy Cage works great for Indian Ringneck Parrot Easy to put together, beautifully crafted, and intuitive design. There are two locking mechanisms and the cage is incredibly sturdy. I am IN LOVE. The instructions were not that clear but still was able to figure it out after some time.  Took about 45 minutes to build.  Very well packaged and comes with paint brush and matching paint to do touch ups.  Product is amazing my cockatiel loves it very much.  Lots of room to climb and play with her toys and the ladder above can be used to hang toys and such.  Very sturdy cage and very well built.  Easy to clean and catches all the flying food particles and feathers.  Must have aviary for any bird. ", "If your looking for a cage for a conure, this is the one.  Nothing but great things to say and it will last.  Great price for a high quality product.  These guys do it right! I love the bird cage I read how bad instructions were in reviews but found that they weren't bad at all. Anyone with any sense can take their time (20 minutes) and do it! That said I'am really pleased with this and my bird Loves it. Love this cage, easy to clean and a great size. The directions that came with it were the correct directions just very vague. FYI if you don't have the panels right the holes will not line up to screw it together. This cage is the perfect size for my Quaker Parrot, the only issue is the bars around the edges and door is too thick for him to be able to climb in and out and around the cage. He is happy in it, we just have to take him in and out. Was not sure if it was too big for our cockatiel...but perfect! He likes to hang out at the top most of the day when I am home! Good product for the money our 30 year old blue naped parrot is loving his new home. Had it for years! Zero issues. Just bought the travel Prevue cage. Love this cage!!  It is the same one that a national chain has locally, but this one is about 100.00 cheaper.  Very easy to clean. Yes, you still have to clean up after your birds...doesn't stop everything, but I don't believe that there is a cage that would. You won't regret purchasing this cage. Was shipped quickly and arrived on time. When i got it one piece was bend. I easily fixed it so i assume it was bend in travel. Took about an hour to put together. Everything linded up correctly. Aside from the bend piece the perches they send arent for this cage. They do not fit properly. But they are cheap at petco so its not a huge deal. It was $130 for me and i suppose you get what you pay for. But now that the cage is up its beautiful and sturdy. My green check with love it. ", "This bird cage is a nice size and my cockateil loves it.  Easy to clean as well. I am so happy with this cage, I can't say enough about it.  Came safely packed, no shipping damage at all. Easiest cage I've ever put together. Even comes with a small bottle of touch up paint and a brush. My green cheek conure loves it. I purchased this cage for my green cheek conure.  The cage was very easy to put together with the exception of the seed guards, they were a little awkward for one person to manipulate but I finally was successful in assembling them.  The cage is smaller then I hoped for, I would suggest the next size up for a bird the size of a conure or cockatiel. Excellent product!!! Great quality cage!!!! I have one problem about the design of the cage. The apron around the cage is screwed together. It is hard to unscrew the apron to clean the area. Actually it's annoying!!! Perfect cage for my conure. I have had many cages over the years and this is by far the best I have had. The price is right, bar spacing, and material are all great. It is really easy to clean as well. Love this cage. Love the wheels and the door latch. Overall the cage is a good value if you price shop. Great deal! I got it for my cockatiel. ", "well it wasn't overly difficult to put together although I am pretty handy, I had a couple moments of WTF while working, they \"seed / splash\" guard is useless just makes the cage to big, crap still gets all over, guess if you had a tiny bird it would work, I have a Green Cheek Conure in mine and he loves it... Fast service , fair price . Love this cage and have several of them, they hold up to the birds chewing on the bars and the locks work well too, the cage is roomy enough to hang toys in and add perches in several different places .... This is a nice well thought out design and is very sturdy. The birds might love it but we like it! Would purchase again. It was very easy to assemble. One skirt was ever so slightly bent, but i was ably to straighten it quite easily. Lots of room for the cockatiel, probably too much room. The food containers are ok, seem too deep for the bird. Amazing cage! The price point is great and so is the quality. We have a very happy green cheek! My teen put the cage together and she said it was easy. Captain Billy seems to like it, he is a Green Checked Conure and this seems to be a good sized cage for a bird that size. The materials are very nice, sturdy and fit well. Very happy with this purchase. The cage looks good. Very easy to clean and easily movable for it being so big. Nice food bowls and I don't know why others were complaining but, it was pretty easy to assemble. Although, 2 people assembling the cage is recommended. Color looks better in person. This cage is best suited for birds the size of a cockatiel or conure. My bird absolutely loves it. This cage is absolutely amazing. Very well designed and great for small to medium sized parrots. Only small issue was some of the hex screws were hard to screw in because the screw holes had paint in them. Not a big deal and we're extremely happy with the product Great product ", "Excellent cage for my conure!  Sturdy and well made product materials.  Absolutely pleased. This cage is the best! Great quality. It was pack great and I put it together by myself in no time. When my husband came home was surprised that I put it together and said it was a really nice looking bird cage.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Just put it together and my bird is already spending all his time at the top. He seems to love it so I'm giving it 4 stars. I can't give it 5 because the structure is a bit odd on this cage--not everything aligns right and it got a little banged up on its way here. I just purchased this bird cage for my African Grey parrot and I was very pleased. He loves it and it fit perfect where I put it. I\u2019ve used this cage to keep Cockatiels and Conures and they\u2019ve done great in it. Easy to assemble and keep clean. I like this cage overall, but it came with a lot of bent up parts that I had to rig together. Amazon was nice and partially refunded me. Nice cage but can be hard to clean if you bird sits in the top railing (like mine has always insisted on doing) because the seed guard has to be unscrewed to remove it for washing.  Had a damaged lower tray that was replaced with no problem, excellent customer service! Bought this cage for a new Quaker Parrot. The design is pretty solid but the base that catches food around the sides has spotty directions. My girlfriend managed to put the cage together in about an hour so it wasn't an unbearable challenge. Cage comes with extra touch up paint which is nice.  I'd recommend getting better, more natural tree branch perches to prevent sore feet. Overall the cage was just what we needed for the bird we have. Also I've noticed this cage is at least $100 cheaper here than at any pet shop I've been to. It's a nice cage, it wasn't that difficult to put together, you just have to take your time.  My bird seems to really enjoy it, it's nice and roomy and attractive.  I think if I were designing it I would put both dishes near the front of the cage, one on each side, it would make it easier to arrange the toys and perches without worrying about them messing in the dishes. Set it up all by myself with little to no problem! ", "CAGE IS REALLY GREAT. MY PARROT WILL LOVE IT ONCE HE GETS USED TO IT.I BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY CAGE TO LEAVE AT MY DAUGHTERS HOUSE WHEN WE TRAVEL. Great cage for my Green Cheek Conure....my 11 year old granddaughter and me put together easily Love the product. Price is good. Went together nicely. This product came well packaged and was very easy to put together. I was able to assemble the cage by myself in about 45 minutes. The instructions were clear and simple to follow. This cage is exactly what I wanted for my Green Cheek Conure. Mannie is a small bird but he is very active and this cage gives him lots of room to climb and play while not taking up too much space and it looks great. Great The only thing Hawkeye doesn't like about his new home is that he can't reach the new carpet \"cage liner\" and tear it up after it has been changed, other than that he seems perfectly happy with it.  So am I come to think about it. Of course that is the reason we bought it. I've had lots of cages for my pigeon-sized  parrot and hated them all. This cage is just plain incredible. Easiest to clean that I've ever known. Design is genius. Catches most mess too. Cleaning is no longer a chore. Am I in heaven? This is NOT for an African Grey.  It is too high and narrow, with the bird being chest heavy, and could cause seriously injury if she falls that far to the cage floor.  The metal is much thinner than what I would have bought if I had seen it in a store.  It came to the house bent, rusted and damaged.  Most disturbing is that the too DEEP food bowls are placed too close to the perch which is going in the wrong direction for eating, dipping and drinking and there is no room in the front part of the cage to add a perch that does go horizontal to the bowls.  Complete waste of money.  This will be donated to a bird sanctuary. Nice cage. My only complaint is that I had to attach a ladder for my bird to get on top without assistance. We leave the cage open and she likes to go in/out on her own. It was easy to assemble and there was no damage at all. We have two cockatiels and they love this spacious cage.  It has worked out wonderfully and has been easy to clean and keep up. ", "I am impressed by the quality of this cage. It was easy to put together, it looks good and cleanup after the bird is easy. My bird has not yet figured out how to make it to the top when I open the cage but I am sure he will after a few days. He seems to have adjusted quickly to his new \"palace\". This cage is perfect. We have a mini macaw who spends most of the time outside his cage. The play top allows him to hang out on his cage and play and eat. It is perfect for him and he enjoys it. 2nd replacement still damaged but mush less than first! Rusting chipping not even a month old. Very well built sturdy cage. easily put together, everything lined up perfect. My bird loved it right off the bat. Price is also excellent. Very Happy My 14 year old Sun Conure needed more room.  He seems to love it.  He has a little trouble climbing to the top of the cage but has no problem going up the ladder.  It is sturdy, was easy to put together and easy to clean.  the seed guards around the cage work great.  A very nice color- coco brown- for the living room-he likes to be in on all the action-  I would recommend this cage -there is plenty of room. quick delivery- Great Cage Built well and I was able to assemble within an hour. No missing pieces and the handy tool that was provided made it a lot easier I love this cage. It is exactly as described. I wish it was a bit taller where the legs hold the cage up higher off the floor but it works great for my Green Cheek Conure. I bought my last bird cage 12 years ago for over $1000, but the company has since gone out of business so I found this great priced cage and thought I would give it a try.  Well, I got what I paid for!  After using a gift card, the total was $150 - nearly 1/10th of the price of the cage that has lasted me 12 years.  I suspect this cage will not last nearly as long as my last cage.  It is import quality - has numerous defects.  The company claims you can get any part replaced, but I would have to request them all!  Paint chipped in many spots with numerous dents and dings. I love it ! I saw little chipped off, but My bird didn't care the chip off.  My Quaker loves new cage. cleaning easy. A very sturdy cage, purchase this larger size to replace a smaller one of the same brand my bird was growing out of. Did a lot of shopping around and no one could beat the price on Amazon. ", "Very study and nice looking. Nice strong metal! My Cockatiel loves this cage.  I am very happy with it! I have cats and dogs as well as the parrot so I found the cage too low. I put it up on an old stand from another cage and it worked quite well. I have had it for almost a year and it is holding up. Very sturdy strong cage.  My two Indian ring necks love it.  Was easy to put together. This cage is perfect for my African Grey but only because she is on top all day and only stays in the cage at night. A little small for a bird that does not get out :) Bought this for my Yellow Naped Amazon, Paco. She LOVES it!... As in other reviews the instructions were not so great! however, with the picture of it, it was simple to figure out. My adult son put it together with the help of his 12 year old brother! There was one bar that was bent, but nothing to complain about! Very easy to clean, tray slides right out. Great quality and easy to move Great size. Really gives the right amount of space that my Amazon Parrot deserves. She will definitely be enjoying the set up on top. I am very happy with the cage they sent us went together very easy . great my African  grey loves it ", "I love it! Easy to put together and is very clean and sturdy! My Congo African grey has one a little hard to get used to from a smaller cage but it is a very nice cage once assembled the instructions aren't the best and seems flimsey at first but I love it. I also did get a broken part called/emailed and sent out a replacement right away! I love it!!! I bought this cage for my Quaker parrot.  It is fantastic!  Arrived in one day, packaging was excellent, the corners were all reinforced on the box and it was all banded.  Inside everything was bubble wrapped and banded together, it was in perfect condition.  I was a little worried because I had read that it was difficult to put together and the instructions were bad.  I had no problem at all, did it completely alone and the instructions were fine. It took me from removing from the box to finish about an hour.  The cage itself is beautiful!  And so well constructed! My Quaker took right to it, climbing and inspecting it as I was putting it together.  She slept in it the first night.  Don't be shy about purchasing this cage, you will love it.  There is room for birds up to an African grey size.  My little quaker has tons of room!  I have no negatives to say about it. Nice cage, rough edges on seed guard. Very nice cage! Solid, and prevue will help if you have any issues... My perches were a little frayed, no problem, replaced! I would recommend! Well constructed, easy to assemble, and escape proof ! This is a beautiful cage.  I love it It was a last minute decision to get a Quaker Parrot for xmas and I found this cage on Amazon.  It was a better price than any comperable cage I could find - not to mention that I received it the very next day after I ordered it with free prime shipping. The directions were not the best so I take a star away, but it went together very easily and is well designed. No regrets on this one and I recommend it. Absolutely love this cage! My 2 conures are very happy with their new home and play yard! everything came in amazing condition and was really easy to put together! Thank you so much! ", "We have 2 of these for sugar gliders. They are attractive and give them space to climb. Since they are tall vs wide they don't take up space and you don't need a table to set the cage on. Well built, heavy made. This is not a flimsy cage as many others out there are. Very nice for the price. I wish the sides were a little bit stronger for add on toys food bowls ext.  my African gray loves it very easy to keep clean. I would Recommen to a friend. the quality is great - the price is even greater!  love the easy open doors for food and water and the extra lock to make sure that the kitties don't figure it out Awesome product and fast shipping My cockatiel loves his new home. Not big enough for a larger bird. Easy to clean up and like the seed guard. We love it and our cockatiel loves it! So much room and it's beautiful. Will match almost any decor and you'll have a very happy bird. I read almost all the reviews before purchasing this cage.  Most of the negative reviews I read were about the instructions.  I did not find anything wrong with the instructions.  In fact, they were pretty much step-by-step on how to put it together.  I am in my 50's in case anyone thinks I am right out of school and some techie.  It is very sturdy and bird proof.  In case you have a bird that is constantly trying to escape this cage is a minerature Alcatraz.  Cannot say enough good things about this cage! Sturdy and last long seed shields flimsy...& ill fitting...otherwise very nice ", "I love this cage. Easy to assemble the quality is outstanding.  So easy to get my bird in and out of and to move the cage around. I am going to order another for my other bird. The seed catchers around the cage word wonderful. They really do help to keep the seed off the floor. I don't leave reviews but this cage is amazing. I found it in several pet stores for twice the amount I paid. I bought it for my green cheek conure it's as big as a house for her plenty of room. Assembling was very simple and easy would recommend for anyone with a medium size bird My vet approved, my conure loves his cage. Great slur, easy to assemble, easy to clean. The cage was as expected, however the seed guard was very disappointing.  After working with it for several hours, it just didn't come together to form a good fit.  It was bent out of the package so I have to order a new guard. The cage itself is n8ce, but I paid for this cage to help reduce what ends up on my floor.  As an alternative, I will most likely go to a plexiglass cover.  I wish it worked as advertised. I bought this for my cockatiel. My other one has a king cage and it is very comparable. Well made and my bird is happy! Great product, easily put together. Very study! This is a great cage for the price. Went together very easy. I did not even use instructions. Inside bowls lock down so bird cannot dump them out. Easy to clean. Deep trays work great with cracked corn. It is a nice size cage for my cocktail. My one strong criticism is the vertical bars on the front Our parrot will not be able to escape from this thing!  The directions were good, it went together easily.  The food doors are really nice; I don't have to risk losing any blood from reaching my hand in the cage.  The food doors swing open so that you can easily fill them. Love this cage. It was easy to assemble by myself, used the couch to prop against instead of having someone else me. My Conure loves it! ", "was a little hard to put together due some parts were bend Nicely made very sturdy and stylish very easy to put together and beat petsmart &Pets supply plus price by $50 -$100 None This is a great parrot cage. Really solid. Nice looking. Highly practical. Easy to put together. Our parrots love it and we do too. Bought this for my conure. He likes the cage. Only issue is the top porch, that my wife does not like. There were some chipped and rusted areas on the brand new cage, that is why I am giving a 4 star. Great cage with a great color. It was easy enough to put together. The color and design is true to the picture. The cage is well built and easy to keep clean. I have never owned a bette cage in my life. They even sent a tiny canister of paint in case of chips! This is a wonderful cage, well-made and very sturdy.  The instructions are a joke, but I managed to get it together in a reasonable amount of time.  My Quaker Parrot adapted quickly and seems very happy in it.  I like how the feed bowls can be swung out so if someone other than me feeds him they won't get bit!!  It is very easy to clean too. This cage is so nice and easy to put together. My two Parrotlets live in this big house, with no problems. I love the fact it's on wheels. My birds are happy and so am I. I have to agree with several other reviews that mentioned the horrible gas/diesel smell that filled my living room after opening the box. I located the source of the smell on the black caster wheels. Love this cage, not too small and not too bid, has built in play stand, great price... ", "Good size and excellent quality it is perfect for big birds and easy  to clean I just love that part,is not to heavy and is all in metal so your bird is going to be save and happy in this big cage. We really like the cage, nothing bent or broken, but the side panel opposite the food dishes is rusted through in some spots.  It looks like it was painted over the rust because I can scrape off some of the paint and I am finding rust underneath.  I am just going to scrape off the rust and paint over those spots I guess.  It won't be powder coated in those spots though.  Hopefully it won't be too noticeable.  Pretty shoddy workmanship for this manufacturer.  They need to tell their painters to remove the rust before they do the painting. I am thoroughly please with my Prevue Pets  purchase.  The cage was very easy to assemble (with the help of my 9 year old) and my baby cocktail loves his new habitat! Very nice high-quality birdcage! Awesome cage. Easy assembly. I have a GCC living in one now! Bought this cage for my green cheek Very nice, right size, seems very well made...overall very satisfied. Nice sturdy cage , very pretty . My bird loves it. After owning this cage over a half a year.  I can definitely say its a well made cage and enough space to keep my 2 Sun Conures. Great size for a sleeping cage for large bird like cockatoo....?But my bird opened the feeding doors in five minutes and got out and ate a door in my house,so I had to ode lock both feeding doors.. ", "I purchased the 18x18x57 and it's the perfect size for my cockatiel. Byrd loves her cage! The tray works really well. Some feathers and shavings do escape but for the most part they all fall into the tray below with the help of the outer \"wings\". The perch on top is pretty awesome addition to the cage. Very simple to put together and is very very very well made. The Cage is good the bed Think is sicru when assembledet its not exekly majore the holl  enader wise its biuti really nice cage My lucky is love play ride way Great value Came damaged and wonky. Very unclear instructions. Weak bolts with a wrench that was the wrong size so I stripped the first bolt. I thought it was easy to put together. Perfect size for my 1 conure, I'm using this as a play area. Petey loves his home! Does the job but not stylish at all. Great product. But it was too small for my Indian ringneck. Good for smaller birds Well made and a great price! I bought it for a cockatiel, but my GCC loves the ladder and play top more than she does! ", "Purchased this bird cage from amazon and love it.  I have a Macaw and he is on an outdoor perch all day but in the cage when we are gone and at night.  The cage is light in weight for easy movement and the trays come out very easily for cleaning.  The lock on the door is awesome so that no bird can open it...it is a spring lock with an additional tab to hold door closed.  They even sent touch up paint and did not need it. Very well made, but was too small for my Blue Crown, I returned to go with a larger size. Pieces arrived bent. Some of the holes were not fully punched out and had to be forced. Honestly expected a better product. Very well made price is great saw same cage at major Pet store for 279.00. Very easy to assemble. I wish there had been a 3 1/2 star rating.  I've had to improve with some ingenuity to get this cage comfortable for my Quaker Parrot to use.  The top tray of the cage was making it too difficult to step down from or up to.  So if she was on top of the cage she couldn't climb down to the lower cage area on her own.  Quakers love to climb so tall cages are always recommended for them.  I was finally able to fix this situation for her by connecting a rope perch from the top rung of the ladder to the cage just above the door.  She is now happy to use the rope perch to climb back and forth.  I think it is unethical for a company to include only one interior perch for any cage.  I have started using the branch style perches that screw in place for additional perching/climbing.  I also have placed a wooden ladder in the cage to help her explore ect.  She enjoys her cage and that is what is most important.  However a few tweaks here and there would make this cage more user friendly. Purchased the 18x18 for my cockatiel! Put it together myself. Seed catcher isn\u2019t perfect at catching all the seed but that\u2019s my only complaint thus far! Wonderful. Sturdy. Airy. Roomy. Great value on a quality cage It is perfect for my green cheek conure.  Plenty of room for toys, etc.  He loves it.  Great fitting seed guards.  Easy to assemble.  It arrived early. Since I move it each night into a quiet room, I am impressed on how easily to rolls on the casters.  Could easily accommodate two birds.  I love it as much as he does. The seed catcher is useless. This is a top quality product with great customer service ! I highly recommend this product. This is our second cage by Prevue. ", "Last review was removed, I wish I could give less than one star as I found Prevue pets to be a company that takes no pride in their product and would not stand by multiple defects. After extensive communication with prevue there was no compassion or resolve from them. I was sent a tiny bottle of paint for a cage that was unusable and dangerous. This cage had so many faults and posed so much risk to my bird that it went in the trash. For this reason I recommend avoiding a company and their products such as this. If you currently have any product by them, look it over very carefully. Metal fragments ingested in your bird or animal can be fatal. I have had Preview cages before. Needless to say this one does not disappoint. Beautiful cage. Be prepared to spend several hours putting it together. Total bs. There is nothing wrong with this cage or how much my bird loves it. Arrived packaged well.  Easy for me to put it together.  Bird loved it.  Bought another for my other one.  Have two  and the other bird constantly wanted to be in this cage.  Different breeds cannot be kept together. This is very sturdy. Firm can be knocked over while I'm cleaning it. I'm thinking of buying another for a different room. Not heavy to carry. I'm 5'3 135 lbs. and a girl. This is a pretty great cage for my little Green Cheek Conure. It is the perfect size and he loves the little perch on the top. However, while putting it together I found quite a few issues with parts being bent up and some of the holes for bolts not lining up. Not sure if the dents were from shipping or if they happened in factory. Fast shipping -  cage quality very good, highly recommended -  I  use this for my Amazon parrot I like the cage.  It's perfect for my bird Great Price on this birdcage. Very well made and perfect for a small to medium sized bird. ", "Nice cage for the price easy to assemble Love this cage (my GCC loves it too).  I especially love how easy it is to clean. My parrot loved it immediately. It was easy to assemble it. It is nice looking cage. The wheels are great, cage is easy to move around when cleaning under it. Design is very parrot and human user friendly. kinda frustrating to build a few of our parts did not fit quite right, but it is a great cage once it is built we keep a cinni green cheek conure who seems to enjoy it. Is great for a Parrots. Easy to clean. Parlanchin is very happy with your new \"home sweet home\". Is excelent!! very happy with it, perfect for my sun conure! Great bird cage. Well made. Super easy to put together. Only took 20-30min from unboxing to done. It came a little bang up, but is easy to put together, the splashers are wonderful, space is big enough for a caique (more like a caique palace ;-) ) My bird & I are super happy with this cage.  The price I purchased it at was $140 less than similar cages at pet stores.  The quality is great for the price, it is well designed and nicely finished, the included bowls and perches are top quality.  The seller shipped the product very quickly; the cage arrived well before the initially promised delivery date.  It was very well packaged & protected for shipping and arrived undamaged despite UPS beating the heck out of the box.  All parts were included, along with some spares, and there was even a small bottle of touch-up paint in the event any rubbing occurred during shipping.  Assembly was straight forward and easy, although the directions were a little outdated (some screws shown were replaced with hex bolts instead).  The only issue with the cage were the rubber balls on the casters.  They were evidently recently produced and producing VERY strong-smelling fumes - not good for your birdie's delicate respiratory system.  I set them aside to air out for the time being.  A small & easy to fix issue on an overall great purchase.  Highly recommend. When I received this cage there were a few problems, the play top and the tray were both bent and then the food door ring holder was plugged with excess paint/powder coating. Prevue sounds like they are going to replace the pieces... I hope they follow through. ", "It was just what write up said it would be.  Got it for new bird. Muy buen producto None Great product. As described and very well made. Heavy duty. Best of all, my cockatiel very much approves! Love this cage.  Assembly instructions not very detailed.  Found great instructions on YouTube.  Very easy to put together!! Well made cage perfect for our cockatoo.  Easy access food doors and tight locking door. It arrived faster than I expected, was easy to assemble, and is exactly as it is depicted.  My bird is happy in it. My bird loves his new home Well made and easy to assemble. Had to put in a beefier perch, but that was expected. Some of the parts were bent, easy fix. One screw does not want to go in, another easy fix. Great cage for 2 cockatiels. They love it! Door size could have been smaller. And food bowl locations could have been lower. ", "I already had one of these cages for 2 other birds. It's so easy to clean I ordered another! Love this cage and so does my conure. It looks nice in my living room too. Arrived bent in multiple locations and not all the metal was actually punched out of the holes in in multiple locations which made assembling quite fun. I received this product in damaged condition. Bent in about 6 different places making it very hard to assemble. I had to try an re-bend the pieces back in order to be able to make the pieces join. The top perch assembly was so out of square that I can't get the ladder to line up in the holes provided so it sits on an angle. Good quality Perfect for my little guy Great size cage for my cockatiel.  Came as expected with minor bent parts. Less cleanup but the catcher did not solve the complete problem  of seeds on the floor. Great cage so far. This product is just what I expected! I love it! But some of my pieces did come bent I bought this for my daughter, at her request.  She is 16 & put it together by herself in a few hours & says her bird loves it & so does she! Larger than I expected, super easy to put together and great quality! ", "This cage is as expected with the exception of the paint. It arrived marred in several places, touchup paint is provided. It assembles in less than 30 minutes. My bird loves this product. Very easy to clean, even comes with extra paint to touch it up occasionally. Great for my Quaker... Great sturdy cage, everything came in correctly. And none of the bars were bent like the other reviews said. I didn't have to bend one piece but that was probably my fault Really wonderful Saturday cage, just came with a couple dents I had to bend back. the cage itself is ok...the cleaning is a hassle! It's impossible to get the seeds out of the seeds catcher...It takes me an hour to clean the cage! Its a very nice cage but the play ground stick is crack and bent. And its only came with one wooden stick for the interior. Excellent cage - well made, solid. Seed catcher is better than not having one at all, but my Green Cheek Conure manages to throw stuff anyway. He loves this cage. We love this cage , our green cheeck Conure loves it to once he got use to it. This is a fantastic product for the price. It's attractive and functional. ", "My cockatiel loves his cage! This is a heavy and sturdy metal cage that requires two people tackle it, so that one person can hold panels together while another persons fastens them securely. The included long and short hex screws and bolts are sized appropriately. Great cage for our Amazon Grey Parrot.  Good quality and easy to put together.  Our  bird has plenty of wing space for when flapping and exercising. Good quality, all parts there, easy to put together Came in perfect shape. Not too difficult to put together. Very high quality.

Look no further.  This cage is just great.  My conure loves it.  I love it.  The assembly is fairly easy and it is very sturdy.  It looks exactly like the product photo. Beautiful cage. The only thing I wish I could change is for our bird to be able to come in and out of his cage on his own. He can't because of the way the bars are designed. Great quality cage also very easy to clean. Very Sturdy, Easy to assemble, Nice Looking, Want Another One. ", "This is a very nice cage, particularly given the low price.  Took me about 30 minutes to assemble, fairly intuitive.  We were surprised by how easily bird poop wipes away compared to our last cage. Beautiful cage.  I love it. I love this cage for my sweetheart Tyler, a Quaker Parrot.  He loves it, too! My Quaker parrot loves it.  Since she spends most of her time on top of the cage I drilled holes in the dowel and attached a natural branch, add some toys and a rope and she is thrilled.  I got the jade which is a pretty green color.  It is roomy enough for her, her toys and a snugly. Never open the package it came damaged  and wrong size Everything would expect. Great quality cage.

To make them fit around the cage I would have to cut off the tabs that holds them on and reweld them back in another place and cut down the plates too, They are to long also. My parrot loves his new home especially the play area being on the top. I love it because of the size. Big enough for him and small enough not to be a hindrance for me. Clean up is super easy.

The only problem I had was one of the metal bowl split part way which makes it difficult to take out of the colder when cleaning and feeding the birds. Excellent quality cockatiel cage.  Easy to assemble and sturdy.  The walls are not flimsy. Awesome quality! Works great ", "real nice cage Mango is a king in his Prevue cage. Loves it!!!! Strong, sturdy and very worth it.

My the birds love to climb in and out of it during the day,spending a lot of time on top playing with their toys.The apron around the bottom keeps most of their mess from reaching the floor.This cage was designed with people and birds in mind. My bird doesn't go down to the bottom so half the cage is wasted, but it's easy to clean and looks nice ", "Great cage for 1 cockatiel.  I wish it had storage space on the bottom. my bird seems to like it. No holes on one side of the top portion so I can only use one bowl. This cage is a deal and a half!!

The metal on this is a little \"echo-ie\" took awhile for my african grey to get used to it. Bird settled into her new home quickly.  I do wish the seed catcher was bigger though Hard to put together, sharp edges and chipped paint that can't be fixed with the touch up paint included. It was really easy to set up. Would have preferred the gold one but it was out of my budget. Good solid cage. Only complaint is some of the bars and seed guards were bent. I was able to fix this with pliers. Easy to read instructions. I purchased the 20x24. ", "It was a bit challenging to put together with the chineese instructions and all, but I love this cage, peaches loves it too.

Why because, I paid for next day was supposed to be delivered Friday instead got it on Monday! Have to do a bit of tweeking!  My suncoure seems to like it so far! Great bird cage, great price! This will be a wonderful cage for my African Grey when we board her. Great cage. A bit harder than we thought to assemble.  Instructions weren't that helpful but the picture on the box helped more.

The directions were a little unclear, but ultimately got it all together! At first i was hesitant to purchase this cage. But I am so glad I did! Amazon has the best price compared with Petsmart and Petco (over $200). The color is \"garnet red\" and matches perfectly with my house! One of the trays was slightly damaged but it is the at the very bottom of the cage and is unnoticeable. I like that the top play area has a pull-out tray for easy cleaning. It took me about an hour to assemble but it was definitely worth it! It is the perfect size and shape. My cockatiel loves his new home! Always great bird cages,  just wish they weren't made in China.

Love this for my Parrot, I have a double yellow headed amazon parrot, and its a little bigger than he probably needs but he loves it. actually didn't need.  Sent back with no issue We bought this and put it together.  It is SO low to the ground.  Our parrot has had the bottom of his cage at least 3 feet off the floor for 30 years.  Also the demensions stated were not for the actual cage, so it was really not tall enough.  the measurements were for the total height.  We tried to exchange, but were told you cannot exchange with a bank card?  So now other things have come up and our bird is still in his old cage. ", "Works perfect for our cockatiel. Easy to clean. Sturdy. This cage is perfect for my Green Cheek Conure, he loves it and it's super easy to clean! Best cage I could find and great price! Green Cheek conure loves this home! Perfect size! I don't know if I \"love\" this cage as much as I thought. First, the silver bowls that came with it. Cracked. I didn't know a metal bowl could even break? I don't do anything but gently clean it and put it back in their cage. They wouldn't even replace it for free! I had to repurchase all of the ones that broke. Anyways now about the cage. He lock is broken. And one of the spacing bar whatever you call it. Is broken! I wasn't aware and I heard my bird scream the living hell out of his body. So I went to check up on him and to see his head was stuck between the bars. This cage is not even 2 years old and it is already breaking down! Do we even have a warranty? I thought this cage was suppose to be heavy duty????? Great cage for the price. Very sturdy for my Grey. Castors roll easily. Only thing I wish it had  was a door for a breeding box. Very easy to assemble by yourself. 5 stars for this bird cage! I am very satisfied with this product.  My 11 year old daughter could assemble it.  It is strong and durable.

It was easy to assemble, very sturdy, and looks great.  Some pieces were slightly bent, but they were easily fixed with a pair of pliers.  The seed guard does its job.  With 2 budgies in this cage, they have plenty of room to fly and we have lots of room for their toys.  We couldn't be happier. Beautiful cage as described. Easy to assemble, arrived quickly! easy to clean Finally.  High quality and affordable. my birdies are happy in their boxes This cage is great for my cockatiel.

Only thing is my wife and I are a little bit disappointed on the fact the bird seed still ends up on the floor. Quality cage for a great price! The best cage i ever bought...period. A wonderful bird habitat.  Great buy for the money. Excellent ", "Cheap Chinese product. Is it was fairly easy to put together. The reason for the one star is the front frame to the cage was bent along the entire length which prevented the bottom waste tray to be placed in so I had to awkwardly place it underneath the cage. The seed catching plates don't fit together due to also being bent. The bad part regarding the bent parts is the boxes they were put in were not ripped which meant this company doesn't care or have quality control. Plus I'm not gonna pay the crazy amount to try to get a replacement back from china. My African Grey loves to sleep in my room and now she can in her new sleeping quarters my birds love it Well made and good price. Excellent for the price. My wife was very surprised and happy with this bird cage for Christmas. The wheels are a great feature for bringing the bird around closer to us when we want For my Budgie Rio Great materials & strong , thank you We have 1 parrotlet. We needed something to contain seed mess, something solid to withhold dog/cat curiosity, and something that looks clean and nice in the main room.. I've reviewed many cages and finally decided to settle on this one. We plan on moving into a very small home (300 sq ft or less) so having anything too big (or wide, rather) to start out with would be a bad idea. This cage however just seems perfect so far. Awesome!!! ", "Very well made, reasonable price. Easy set up and shipped free to Puerto Rico nice Nice cage but the pan that catches the food doesn't fit quite right.

This cage might seem extravagant for a lovebird, but the better the cage, the better your bird's life will be - and yours, as well. Easy to assemble, easy to clean, and safe for your feathered friend. The door and seed gates close securely, and the seed guard assures that you'll spend more time with your pet than your vacuum cleaner. You won't beat the size or quality for this price. I'm going to get another for my cockatiel. excellent ", "A bit of an IQ test butting it together  but looks great. Am  assumming that the price redu nn Well built, very happy with this Love it! The cage is sturdy and well-designed, it arrived in excellent condition with all the parts plus some extra screws and nuts. It took about 45 minutes to assemble, but half of that was just getting it out of the very protective packaging. I only wish it had slightly taller legs, even just 3\"-4\"would help, so my jenday conure would be a little higher when inside the cage - but it is already much better than most cages that way. Just what I wanted. Great cage My bird loves his Condo! Was shipped out really fast. Was easy to put together. My little bird Mango loves her new home. worth every bit of money.

It took some time to assemble but was not very complicated. Good construction and finish. I expect this to last a long time. When ordering be sure to check \"more buying choices\". I paid much less than the default price initially shown. I like the bird cage, so does my bird. It was easy to assemble. The one complaint I have is the catch all does not catch all. It does help but my conure is a messy bird and it does not attach very well to the cage so alot of his food ends up on the floor anyway. :( Both I and my African Grey love this cage. When I was putting it together, I got worried that it wouldn't be very strong because the side panels \"slide\" down on a track between the back and the front. In all honesty, it hasn't been a problem at all. The cage is very sturdy, and the wheels make it super easy to wheel outside on cleaning day. African Greys can be pretty hard on cages with their powerful beaks, and this cage has held up incredibly well. The bar thickness is great.  All in all, I like this cage and if (when) it finally wears out, I'll definitely purchase another one. my bird love it Purchased for a Quaker parrot.  There is plenty of room in the wrought iron select bird cage.  Good quality cage for a medium size bird and a decent price. Quick delivery. My little bird and I love this cage!!

Instruction Could Be Much Better Also. Great product, a bit pricey though. Cleans up with ease. My Tango and Many love it so that is what it is all about.

My green cheek conure loves it!! It came bent.... Instruction were terrible. I had to use the picture on the web site to assemble the cage. The outer guards are badly made. Great cage for my green cheek conure! The cage is very nice and it looks bigger than in the picture. It is more grey than black, but still very attractive. I had mine shipped to me with lots of damages. The cup holders on the play-top were broken off. The cage seed catchers were bent. The poop trays had dents in them.

My conure loves it and it is the perfect size for him. I would say this cage is too small for anything bigger than a 'tiel though. It might fit a small amazon. This is a great product. Our Green Cheek Conure has never been happier-- seriously! While in every enclosure previous to this, he would either mope, or screech with disapproval. Since giving him his new home, he is much better-mannered and flutters from side to side gleefully. I don't know if others will experience the same, but our buddy loves it. I purchased one of these cages from the pet store I work at once in a desperate quick cage upgrade for one of my cockatiels. I didn't give much thought to it at first, and just bought it on my way out of the store figuring it was the nicest one we had. I was absolutely correct and now feel like this cage is THE BEST bird cage there is and recently purchased a second one from amazon (the price is much better online). The other bird cages I've used are terrible to clean, you have to separate the bars from the bottom in order to really clean them, most are bulky and hard to move, even other cages that have a metal grate like this one aren't as easy to clean. This prevue cage has a grill that slides out like a drawer, and a bottom tray that's really deep for messy birds. Once both are out its a straight drop to the bottom, with means nothing else gets mess on it. The play gym top is optional to install, along with the top tray, but my birds love it, I only have to open the door then they climb right up. The cons of this cage aren't too terrible, the bars at the bottom (along the sides of the tray) need to be wiped off often, and the seed guard is useless with cockatiels. they crunch their food and launch it at warp speed vertically out of the cage. Overall I love this cage. I plan on buying a larger size for my Green cheek conure. This cage came much quicker than the delivery date showed.  It arrived in great shape.  No damage other than a couple minor surface scratches.  No big deal.  The cage is beautiful.  We couldn't decide between the 18\" and the 20x24\" cage.  We opted to get the larger one (20x24).  So glad we did.  We have 2 Cockatiels in it with lots of toys and there is plenty of room.  The smaller cage would have been a little tighter.  So we made the right call.  We love it and the birds love it.  Only thing is the birds can't get to the play area on top without help so we will have to get something to hang there to help them. I have a green cheeked conure, and I bought the 18 x 18 x 57. I assembled it myself in about 1.5 hours, and it was pretty easy. It's a great cage and it's very heavy and sturdy. I feel like some of the things on it are actually a little too big for a cockatiel or a small conure - the playtop on the top feels awfully big to me for his little feet. You'll need some kind of a ladder or something hanging over the side so your bird can climb from the door to the top. I just put it together and while putting it together paint was literally chipping off all over the place. That one: is just not safe the bird because he can ingest it and I am soooo upset about that and two the cage will prob rust now which also is not safe.  That alone right there is a huge disappointment esp for the price I paid to have the whole thing chipping apart. The location of the cups suck and the way it is set up makes it impossible to put a different bar in the cage in between the cups. You have to use the perch that comes with it, since its dab smack middle in the center it makes it hard to set up other perches around that one with enough room/ease for my bird. I'm seriously all around not happy with this cage, it also came with the most horrible god awful miserable smell to it. I washed all the pieces and it still reeks. Why does it smell so bad!!!!! I waited last min to put this together before moving and now im in debate about what to do...either way its getting trashed or returned...Im praying to find something this weekend for my bird or I'll be out for a cage that cost me over 100 bucks. I have been building these cages for years and I have never been so disappointed in receiving such a damaged cage. Building these things are a piece of cake for me but this one made me want to die. After finally getting the \u201chard\u201d parts out of the way that they suggest having a \u201cenlisting a friend to help with\u201d I went to attach the top and everything is off by a smidge so it won\u2019t go on. This isn\u2019t user error, I worked at a pet store for 8 years and worked in the bird department. I literally built these cages for a living and have 6 of them of my own. I guess the quality has gone down over the years. I\u2019m so disappointed. My cage doesn\u2019t have a top...the other pictures show bent areas of the cage and a broken off piece where the tab should go to connect the sides to the front and back. The grate is warped on the top as well. I bought the 36x24x66 (black hammertone) cage for my African grey!  She is adopted and came with an ENORMOUS cage that forced me to take doors off hinges in order to take it outside for cleaning :( This review is on the putting together of the cage after receiving it in the mail only !  First of all, I have seen lots of comments on the box not being complete with all the parts and a strange smell, etc.  The cage we received (the 18x18x57) had none of that.  It came complete, well packaged and in excellent condition.  Secondly, I have seen comments about the instructions to put it together being incomplete and basically just pictures of how to put it together.  Again, totally different than what we received.  For someone who has put together any type of products (furniture, toys, etc) this will be a breeze.  Step by step instructions were provided and the pictures for the most part were spot on.  The only part that was a bit confusing was the very last step of putting together the seed skirt. But after a few minutes it makes sense and you almost feel like a dope for not understanding what was listed.  The build process took about 90 minutes to complete.  It took two of us (me, 53 yr old dad and my 18 yr old daughter) to finish.  The only tools needed were the enclosed allen wrench and at the end a pair of needle nose pliers (helps hold the nuts when fastening the seed skirt.  The second person is needed a few times just to have another set of hands.  Bottom line recommendation based on my experience:  GET IT !  We are waiting on our cockatiel baby to be weaned so we can bring it home from the breeder.  I cant see this cage not being perfect for him because it is well built, easy to put together and it seems very sturdy !!  If I remember, after we receive our bird and he has been in the cage for a bit, I will update this review, but again, I cant see why this cage wont be perfect for a cockatiel or anything smaller !!! ", "After searching several sites/stores for a large bird cage with a seed catch, we decided on this one. While it was on the pricey side of what we were looking for, it had great reviews and everything we needed. Received this cage with all parts, but not all parts fit the cage!  The holes in the panels of the lower food-catching wings did not match up, causing us to not be able to utilize all the screws as intended.  The top ladder is completely manufactured incorrectly.  It is 1 step too long, and completely does not fit into the holes.  As a result, we had to buy zip ties to hold it together.  The entire set was a disappointment.  We tried to contact Prevue directly at (312) 243-3624 to resolve the problem directly, as we preferred to get replacement parts than shipping it back to Amazon (tedious and very heavy to assemble, let alone take apart and taxi over to UPS since I live in a secured building without a concierge), but unfortunately, no one from Prevue ever returned our calls. Shipping was quick and the cage arrived well-packaged.  So well it practically took me longer to open the box than to set up the cage.  I am a 67 year old widow and had no help putting the cage together but still managed to do it in just over an hour.  Probably would have taken less time if I had actually read the directions!  LOL  I got this cage because of the seed guard.  Not because my bird throws her seed when she eats, it was more for her pooping when she is outside of the cage, which, by the way, is all time unless it's night.  It's also the reason I chose the white color.  It matches her poop!  I do have one of those plastic things you would put under a desk chair, but got weary of having to wash it off every day.  This new cage helps with that.  In a way, the cage is TOO overdone.  I failed to see the reason for a tray on the bottom AND the top and, therefore, am only using one of them.  The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars is that the play top perch set-up was not drilled correctly.  There are supposed to be two sets of holes to hold the feed/water cups but they were underneath the perch setup not on top the way they were supposed to be.  Fortunately that error didn't bother me since I had no intention of using them anyway.  If Sophia (my 5 month old) cockatiel wants food, then she can just march herself in the cage and get some!  Hope this information helps. I got this as a replacement for a cage that I had that was similar size but very plain. I kept ending up with A LOT of bird food on the ground and my bird making a mess of the newspaper I was laying down, causing a mess. With this cage, there's the shield around the bottom, which while not 100%, was at least minimizing the mess. Also the tray with the newspaper is under a bottom grill that is the bottom of the habitation section of the cage, meaning my bird CAN'T create a mess of the newspaper that's supposed to be collecting poop. The only complaint I'd have is the tiny little tab that is at the top edge of the door, which you have to move out of the way to open the door. But it's not a deal breaker. I did remove the collection tray that goes on the top for the play area. With it in, the interior of the cage became very dark, cave-like. It's the same size as the bottom tray though so it makes it easy for cleaning purposes instead! We have the 18X18 for 1 Cockatiel, we have the 20X24 for 1 Green Cheek Conure, and the 36X24 for 1 Ducorps Cockatoo.  The largest cage came in damaged three times.  All 3 times it was the catch pans that arrive with significant dents.  We are going to make due with the dents on this 3rd cage since I'm sick of shipping back and forth.  The large cage also doesn't feel as sturdy as the smaller 2 cages.  I would not buy the largest cage again and would buy a different brand for the larger sizes. I bought this cage for my green cheeked parakeet. Less than a month after having it I took it outside and washed it. I used mild soap, rinsed it with a regular water hose on very low pressure, a bit more than a trickle. I then dried it with microfiber clothes and brought it inside for use. I was pleased with how easy it cleaned up. About a week later I saw rust where all the hinges were. I saw rust where the food dishes sit as well as every area where the cage had corner or came to a point was rusted. I was so disappointed, the cage was worthless. This cage doesn't disappoint. The 20x24 is perfect size for your cockatiel to keep tail feathers looking good and not frayed from hitting bars in a small cage.  It was SUPER easy to put together with very clear instructions.  I put it together alone and it took me (a girl) about 45 minutes, if that long. I don't understand complaints of wheels smelling. Mine had no smell or oily substance on them.  It was packed very well and was undamaged. All parts slipped together and lined up perfectly. Even the screw holes lined up perfect! It's sturdy for a cockatiel but I would not put a larger bird in this size due gauge of bars.  I think my conure could bend the cage wires if she were destructive.  The bar spacing and gauge of bars are perfect for my Cole, the whistling wonder that was passed around from home to home, until I adopted the little booger.  He could shame a New York construction worker with his wolf whistle....he's that good. Now he has a castle of a cage befitting a beautiful bird. The item was delivered on time. It was easy to assemble, and had only minor nicks and bends. The hex tool is not the greatest. way too soft it got rounded easily, luckily I had plenty of others.  I love the cage, perfect for what I need it for. I wanted something  as small as possible but still plenty of vertical space for the long tail of my IRN. The spacing is just right, 3/4\" is from middle of the wire to the middle of the next, the gap is actually 5/8\". The top is 50 and 1/4 inches high with the wheels on, without the perch on top (this was a piece of information I couldn't find anywhere, hope it helps someone).My bird loves it. Having said that, it is too small for a main cage for an IRN, not enough turn around room (in my opinion, mine lives in a 30x30), but I needed something in my open concept living area that I can lock him in when I'm cooking or doing other things that can be dangerous for him. The color is great, the wider spacing makes this small cage more airy looking. It is very easy to clean. Would give it 5 if it weren't for the minor paint chips. I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I\u2019m just so disappointed with this cage for the price that I felt I had to. First impression of this cage is that is bent coming right out of the box, paint is chipped off already, and there is rust. There is no way that is healthy for my parrot, and considering the longevity of the cage if it is already rusting it just means with regular cleanings that it will rust even more. I also have no doubt in my mind that she will probably be pulling the paint off of it in no time, considering paint is already coming off and how easy it was falling off while putting it together. I highly do not recommend purchasing this cage for the fact that if your parrot ingested enough of the paint from this cage it will most likely get sick. Purchase at your own risk. Very nice, sturdy cage. A lot to put together. I received mine horribly damaged and I had to bend it somewhat into shape so I could use it for a bird that needed a cage immediately. I contacted the manufacturer to purchase the damaged pieces and they didn't return the email. Again I tried. A week later they responded that the pieces were on backorder and they didn't know how long it would be. 6 months later, still no replacement parts. If you buy this, hopefully you never need their assistance. ", "I bought this cage as a second home for my double yellow to have someone watch her when I'm out of town.  I cannot transport my current California Cage back and forth. I would rate the Prevue Cage as 5 out of 1 to 10.  My Cal Cage would be a 9/10, strong and sturdy, one solid piece.  The Prevue cage has to be assembled, it is easy and takes about an hour.  The cage bars are very thin and easy to bend, the finish has small chips on it and one corner had some bad damage on it.  The main perch that goes inside the cage has a large crack going through it and the latch for the door has a bad finish as well.  I attached some pictures with all the issues I found.  I will keep the cage as it will serve as a descent temporary cage for my bird for when I am out of town.  I would not use this type of cage for an everyday cage for my bird after seeing the better quality from my other cage. I was actually really surprised by the quality of this product. Many of the screw holes do not align properly, and the screws are poorly made. This resulted in me stripping 2 of the screws with the provided tool, and causing me to have a partially assembled cage that is unsafe for my parrot, but impossible to disassemble! Additionally, the perches, side walls, and seed-catcher bottom tray were bent, and warped terribly (which, to some extent, I expected based on previous reviews...but it was much more than I imagined). The tray beneath the play surface would've been nice (besides not having a grate to keep feet off from the tray), and the bowls are of good quality. I did not have any issues with rust or chipping paint on any surface that the bird would be in contact with (though there was some on the very bottom where the tray is put in)  I give three stars due to Amazon's amazing customer service, and the fact that it would be a really nice cage... if I would've been able to use it..... This cage was a NIGHTMARE to put together. It took me every minute of 2 hours. A piece of the cage was broken when I received it, the wooden perches gave me a splinter, the cage had brown stuff all over it, the \"touch up paint\" was so watered down, it didn't even begin to cover the spots that needed touching up straight out of the box. I had to pull and stretch METAL to get things to fit where they were \"supposed\" to go. I finally make it all the way to the last step which was the seed catcher. That piece of utter garbage would not go together no matter how much I twisted and pulled and tugged and bent it. I spent so long making the damn thing, I'm not going to take it apart to send it back. I will never purchase from this company again. This was my first bird cage and lesson learned. Spend more money for a better one or buy one from somewhere else where they put it together for you. I am completely and utterly disappointed. Update - I am an avid Prevue cage consumer and this is my FOURTH Prevue cage to purchase. This time I had considerable difficulties in getting a \"complete cage\" delivered.  Only box 2 of the 2-box set arrived and box 1 never arrived.  I had to have several conversations with customer service to get satisfaction in having another shipment sent so I could get a complete cage!  I was quite disgusted in hearing customer service state that the other box was still showing to be delivered on the date specified.  But it never arrived.  Finally, after several days of waiting in anticipation and a newly-shipped parrot waiting in a tiny holding box, the complete cage 2-box set finally arrived!  Many days late...so I am not a happy buyer with this purchase.  Also, one leg of the front panel was bent and I had great difficulty getting it straightened so the roller would fit it.  Several pieces of the channeling where the cage panels slide in were bent up also.  Some broke off.  So my cage seems rather unstable.  I am really not happy with this transaction!  The only consolation is that my new \"traumatized\" parrot finally has a cage to settle in.  I would have given this only two stars, but Prevue is such a great product, generally, that I added one more star.  I am sad about that aspect as I have always given Prevue cage orders 5 stars! We purchased this when we got our second bird-- a quaker-- we got the 24x20 size in sage.  The color is a TINY bit more blue-green and darker than it looks in the bright photo, but it's still beautiful. It's PERFECT.  So easy to assemble, sturdy, easy to clean.  I have zero criticism or complaints.  Neither does my bird.  Haha.  Loves the play top. I was a little worried about putting this together all by myself but I did it. I used both hands to pat myself on the back after completion. Be sure to measure your door frame before putting the seed/poop guard on the bottom because had I put it on before hand I would\u2019ve not got it in the room. Could of used an extra hand a couple times but nothing I couldn\u2019t figure out on my own. After reading all the negative reviews I was sceptical about ordering but I already have one Preview cage that I love. I have two tiels who love this cage. It fits many toys and perches. Its not the widest cage but it is very tall and my birds do love making use of that. I'm very happy with this purchase..its extremely sturdy and the top playgroud area is a huge plus! The seeds still get all over the floor despite the seed catchers but thats to be expected with these messy little eaters. However, the poop stays IN the cage so thats great! The wheels are perfect for me as I love to rearrange the cage depending on the lighting inside. There is a small latch door for easy access to changing the food bowls out. And the two poo trays are extremely easy to remove and clean. I was actually sent a small vial of matching paint incase there were any scratches upon delivery or it needs a touch up which I thought was extremely sweet. The maker of this cage really thought of everything with this and must have birds of their own! This cage is a must! This cage is pretty nice. I downsized to this cage due to the original cage I had purchased was for a large parrot. This cage was easy to put together. I was able to complete it alone with any help. I had to cut the perch down that came with the cage due to being about 3 inches too long for the cage. I think for the cage is priced well. I saw Petsmart now carries the same cage for $220 and I wouldn't pay that much for this cage. I am a bargain hunter though! I had alot of toys to due to having a larger cage, so I had to get creative with them! Really nice quality for this price range - I am impressed.  Packaging was very good too and no major issues with the cage were encountered upon opening the box and removing the various pieces.  Assembly took about 30 minutes or so and was pretty straightforward.  Overall I can recommend this cage based on my personal experience with it.  One thing that has me scratching my head is that I received a different color cage than what I had ordered.  Luckily, the color I received was acceptable and worked with our decor, otherwise I would have had a headache returning it. ", "We bought this as a temporary cage for those times we want our conure to hang out downstairs. We have a large Prevue cage already and we're happy with the quality, finish and design so we decided to stick with the brand instead of some off-brand that is cheaper. LoVe, LoVe It!!! But better yet so does ZoE our Sun Conure, and which is the perfect size for her, lots and lots of room. She was the runt but would be great for any birds conure size. Great quality and looks great, not to mention all the different colors to match every decor. (we got the coco)  Easy, easy to put together, we only had one little hick-up. That was when we put the top on and didn't take notice that the sides having little tabs on the top that fit into top holes. We just couldn't figure out why top would not fit right, but once we figured it out it was all good.. All our fault! Only down side you will have to buy new better perches for inside, it only comes with one, and its an awful fit. Branch perches are much better for their feet. I would like longer legs, or optional extenders, so my bird is at eye level and I don't have to bend down to talk or put things in the cage. I would prefer cups on the front beside the door, not on the side. The cup door latches are tricky to open ( should be able to use one hand) and should have a means ( bar? clip? ) to prevent the bird from dumping seed and water cups. I don't use the top playpen but it is ok for someone who can leave the bird out without supervision.  Don't use the seed catchers because they make the cage too wide for doorways.  It's a well built cage, moves easily and sized perfectly to line with newspaper.  And space deep enough so the bird can't reach the paper or tear it. All in all a decent cage but needs a few tweeks to be great. Love love Love! I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews where people received damaged parts or did not receive parts. The cage arrived and when I opened the box, nothing was missing or damaged. While it says it's best to have two people assemble, I did it by myself and it took about 45 minutes. It's sturdy and I love how smooth the caster wheels are, they are sturdy compared to my prior cage. I got this for a green cheek conure and it's the perfect size! He already loves the play top. I added a picture so you can see the scale... I live in Hawaii so my cage options were pretty limited since not many ship here but I came across this one that would ship and crossed my fingers. It arrived quickly and had a slight dent from shipping although I didn't deduct stars for that reason since it's fairly common to receive damaged items when you live all the way in Hawaii so its something I have come to terms with. It was easy enough for me to put together myself although there are a couple building steps that would be easier with two people. it rolls smoothly and I like the design of it. I use the bottom drawer as a storage for my sun conure's food and toys and lined the bottom level above it so it would stay clean in the drawer. Overall the cage is pretty great for the price and pretty sturdy. The cons however are this, the seed catcher on the outside sticks out pretty far (but you can leave it off) and the seams where it meets the cage isn't sealed completely so some tiny seeds or liquidy poops can fall through, I solved this by just taping over them with masking tape. The food and water holders are where the biggest design flaw is. They are located and meant to be hung directly in front of the side doors, this may be so you can swing it open to pull out the dishes to clean them however the execution was pretty bad. The wire holder wouldn't fit in the holes they have because they have another bar in the way so the fit is too tight to fit the bowls so I had to make it half in half out but if I open the doors they lose support and fall forward, in one instance that resulted in spilling most of my bird's water, I no longer open those doors but could always just buy another food and water dish that attaches to the cage. The only other negative was that the front lock is a spring loaded button so when you press it it flys open making a clanging noise, the first few times it scared my bird but he's gotten used to it, it also has a small metal piece that swings/hangs down to prevent the door from opening if the lock gets unlocked. If you have an extra smart bird/escape artist this might be too easy for them to get out of although I'm sure there are ways to rig it. Product came before date stated. The packaging Had some minor damage on it, but it did not affect the overall product. This particular product came into boxes. The package was quite heavy, but the FedEx person help me to carry it into my house. It took me approximately an hour and 1/2 to put the cage together. I am a 63-year-old female, and if I can do it, anyone can! I googled YouTube and assembling the Prevue birdcage. This was very helpful. Using only the equipment supplied, made it very easy. We have a 25-year-old Lilac Crowned Amazon, that lived with us 19 years ago. Due to the new owners having to downsize and move into a condo, they weren't able to take the bird with them. The cage that she was in, was quite small. We were very anxious to get a larger cage for her. After reading many of the other reviews, we decided this would be the right choice for her and for us. Pokey, went into the cage with very little resistance. She is very happy with her much-needed space and new toys! I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested, and if I ever needed a new, one would buy it once again. Great quality cage. Came in before expected arrival time. Fairly easy to assembly. You'd probably need to be in elementary school to not be able to put one of these together, even without instructions. Took off one star only because there was a slight curve in one of the panels, but once I put it together it was a non issue. Also the seed catchers were really bent out pf shape that I would imagine it would be really hard to assemble them and even if assembled, would probably look very mangled, but I didn't use the seed catchers anyway. It took up too much space and it's not much to just sweep around the cage every few hours. Plus, it came with a note from the manufacturer saying that if there were parts that were damaged in shipment, there is no need to ship them back, and they will send a replacement part. All you need to do is call. I figured since, I didn't need the bent seed catchers, why bother and the slight curve in one of the panels worked it self out anyways. So no harm no foul. This is my first bird cage purchase and I must say, I am quite impressed with the cage itself and the overall quality (considering I had to assemble it myself and every other instruction stated, \"this step will be easier when performed by 2 people\" lol). Assembly was not too bad for just 1 person and I absolutely LOVE the guard/skirt around the bottom. Both the top play area and the bottom catch area are very easy to access and clean as well as the water & food cups. They can be removed without ever actually opening the cage from the front / less disruption and again, very EASY! I ordered and received a play top bird cage (#3151).  I am not at all happy with the quality of the product.  First, the color is MUCH darker than the pictures depict.  Second, the cage has several poor quality welds and the thick iron frame bars were bent in places.  The bolt holes were welded in out of place and I cannot even finish securing the roof to the cage.  The grille clip appears to be of poor design and the wrong size because it does not secure the grille and damages the paint when used as depicted in the instruction manual.  There are more poor welds preventing the play top support structure from being assembled.  Or it may be someone\u2019s mistake in AutoCAD designing it because the round Part 2.1 most certainly does NOT fit into square Part 2.2.  All of this I discovered after spending some time carefully wiping down and cleaning each piece in preparation for my birds.  I am very happy with the ceramic dishes I ordered to fit in the cage and the instruction manual is better than I expected for something made in China (although some of it is printed upside-down).  The seed skirt is a nice design.  If I did not have the above issues, it would make an excellent cockatiel or green cheek conure cage.  I bought it as a second, sleeping cage for my GCC and Sun Conure.  I\u2019m looking to replace their larger, primary cage and I think I\u2019m going to go with the pricier A&E cages. Great cage, came packaged well with outer corner protectors, inside was wrapped in bubble wrap, zip ties and cardboard and Styrofoam went together pretty well some bolts on the top part didn't line up well but I was able to get them in on a slight angle with patients however they were not too far off where I could not get them in, just do it slow until the thread catches and slowly screw in. The wooden perches smelled funky like chemicals so wash them, don't submerge. In fact I would recommend Washing everything before you put birds in it and give it a feel down inside to make sure their are no sharp edges or snaggs in the metal. The only issue I have is the ladder is about 1-1.25 in too long to put in the top play area I can only guess that the ladder was meant for a bigger cage and was accidentally placed with this one. I love that it came with touch up paint and small paint brush, thank you for that. I know it's almost impossible to have a perfect item come through shipping without a small dent or scratch so like the instructions state have some needle nose pliers handy to tweak the dents, I would place a rubber grippy over the metal you intend to reshape to protect the paint from scratching, but like I said it came with touch up paint. All in all our cockatiel is happy it's not a bulky cage, great for smaller apartment and it will fit the net type seed catcher if you decide to not use the one provided with the cage. I would show a pic of the ladder but for some reason amazon does not give me that option with every review???? I recommend this cage! ", "This cage does NOT keep seeds off the floor. I have had this for over 1 year and has never worked. I thought this would help keep them off the floor so my 2 year old wouldn't put seeds in her mouth or anywhere else. (Her nose) well did  no good. Just a waste of money if it's purpose was for keeping the seeds in the cage. Cause she ended up constantly picking up the seeds off the floor. Putting them in her nose. I have no other choice to sweep still after buying this more than 2x a day. He's a green cheek conure and he is messy. That's why we got it. I'm so upset my husband spends so much money to promise that the seeds will stop ending up on the floor from very little to none. Ya right. Not worth it sorry. The tray has the holes to insert the tray in and they are pretty big and not snug into the cage. So they fall out of there when the seeds fall in. What's the point? I posted a pic of the gigantic holes. I am so upset with this purchase.  I purchased this cage to replace/upgrade from a Vision cage with failing clips.  I was really looking forward to getting my birds in a new setup with a play top.  My husband hauled the heavy box upstairs and I started assembing it.  The design seems decent and instructions fine.  I have had birds my entire life and have set up large cages for other birds. I didn\u2019t get very far before realizing there is a manufacturing defect with the cage delivered to me - there are metal shards sticking out from some of the bars of the cage.  Obviously birds slide their beaks and feet along bars and this could be extremely dangerous.  Returning this cage and wish it had worked out differently. I was worried about the negative reviews of this cage, however I found most of their claims baseless (at least in my experience). I ordered a pewter cage and received a sage one but no matter. I ordered the 24\" wide one for my grey parrot. It arrived packaged well but had a few dings and chips in the paint regardless but you also get a small brush and bottle of touch up paint for that. I purchased 2 of these cages to house my greencheek conure and 2 parakeets. They arrived quickly with prime shipping and in perfect condition, packaged very well. Assembly instructions were easy to follow. Cages came with all the hardware and a hex wrench to assemble. No other tools required. It took about 15 minutes each and they went together smoothly. All holes were aligned. No dents in the seed catchers. They even came with a little jar of touch-up paint and a brush, although it wasn't needed. All that was required was for us to add toys and our birds! They're very happy! I think this is as fine a cage you can get for the money. We have a 20 year old African Grey and he loves it. We just move in a new house and still had the cage we bought when we got him. I was worried about how he would react moving to a new house and a new cage but he's very happy. He likes the play area and I like how easy the tray is to change. I had no problems with assembly. I'm pleased with the purchase but the best thing is our bird is pleased. It\u2019s sad when we buy a product for our beloved pets and find out safety isn\u2019t the manufacturer priority. After only 3 months I can see rust in the bowls. Sad. Birds are very sensitive and rust can kill them. Don\u2019t tell the customer you\u2019re product is made of stainless steel when it\u2019s not or just \u201cbathed\u201d in stainless steel. Wish me luck finding real safe bowls that will fit inside the bowl holder rack. The tray around cage leaves a gap around it, seeds fall on the floor regardless. I recently bought this cage because my lovebirds needed an upgrade. I was looking for specific qualities and spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect cage; I expected to spend at least $300. When I first discovered this cage, it was actually in a pet store and would have cost around $250+ but after comparing on Amazon, my boyfriend convinced me to buy this one instead & I saved over $100, which of course was wonderful. Love the color and it was so easy to put together. It isn't all the easy to clean but I'll do my best... This is exactly what I expected, from it's description. The color was exactly as shown,  the teal or green vintage color, we love it. ", "I bought this cage for my Senegal (I know, it's a mansion) because I work part-time, and I didn't like the idea of him without room to play when he had to be caged. Firstly, I'm 5'4\", and I put the whole cage together. Myself. An incredible feat, I know. Once built, the cage itself ends at about my chin, which means I have a full view of the top/play area. The perch, however, is just slightly above my head, so if you're short and have a bird who gets all power-drunk when in a high position, you may want to rethink using the top perch. Otherwise, the cage was fairly easy to assemble (the side panel was a little bowed, so I had to wrestle it in, but I don't see that being a problem). I've had him in the cage for a few months, and my little guy could NOT be happier! Overall this is a good cage for the price. I got it for my lovebird, and it's a great size for her. Lovebirds are very active and she has plenty of room to hop around and spread her wings a little. My complaints would be the bar coating is kind of cheap and I'm unable to get one of the bowl holders on the playstand into the holes because of a shoddy soldering job. Being that this is actually a good size for a small to medium bird, the bars around the door, top, etc, are so wide my bird can't actually get her beak around them so out of cage time is a bit awkward. I have to rig it up for her to come out, she's still being hand tamed, etc. The playstand won't fully screw down so it's a little slanted forward. The bowls are gigantic, but I have her smaller bowls sitting inside them. And last, the seed guard doesn't attach very tightly and definitely stuff falls through to the floor when I brush the edges into the bottom. I wanted a floor cage because my cats can't knock it over, and this is decent, but I definitely expected a little better quality of Prevue. This cage is huge! My African Grey loves the room. The price is great compared to most cages of this size which are priced well over $500, most over $700. I was worried she would not like this cage sine she has lived in a dome-top cages all of her life. I usually replace my birds cages every 2-4 years depending on the condition (if there is any chipped paint, signs of rust starting, etc), so I have many different brands and types between all the birds I have and have had throughout my life. Keep in mind, I have only had these cages (Prevue 3151C, 3152C, and 3154C) for only a short time, but my birds and I are very happy. The 3154C (36x24 inch) cage is huge. I would think this cage could easily house a larger bird then my Congo African Grey. The cage is very solid and heavy weight, much heavier then her previous cages. The caster wheels are much nicer then what her other cage had which were plastic. I only ran into one problem. This cage, 3154C, came with a defective side fame (one of the holes was punched 1 inch off and the side panel could not slip into it correctly). I first contacted Prevue, as instructed by the insert, which would have probably worked out but would have taken longer to replace since the cage was directly purchased from them, I would have need to send them a copy of the purchase receipt and all my information before helping me to fix this. So I called Amazon customer service (or actually asked for them to call me, just follow the instructions under the \"Help\" link and \"Contact Us\" instructions. The Amazon customer service rep was wonderful. He contacted Prevue and gave them all my information and then gave me a direct extension number to talk to the Prevue representative that would handle replacing the part at no charge (for the part or shipping). The part was sent out right away. However, it did take a week for me to receive it but that was due to the distance and since the part was covered under their warranty (according to the Prevue rep) they could not rush it even when I offered to pay the difference. No worries though...the part arrived and I was able to get it all together in about 30 minutes, if that.  THANK YOU AMAZON - YOU ARE THE BEST !!! I ordered this cage for my green cheek conure. Great cage for the price. Size: is a perfect upgrade for him. He has plenty of room to climb around and play...it may even be a tad too spacious for him, if that is even possible. Although with birds you can never give them too big of an enclosure, as they will make use of whatever space you give them. Bird type: sise-wise I would say this cage is perfect for a parakeet or two, a cockatiel, a small to medium conure...(basically any small to medium sized bird), but make sure you check the dimensions before you order as there are a few options to buy. Quality/Design: very sturdy cage, great locking mechanism, coating makes it easy to clean. Bars are thicker and not flexible like other cheap cages. I like how far the catch tray is from the top of the cage because your bird cannot reach the bottom to eat gross, dropped seeds. The top of the cage is a perch/playtop with a removable catch tray, and my bird loves to sit up there (once he got used to it.) There are two mounts inside the cage for the included stainless steel bowls. What is really convienant is that the bowls are attached to their own separate, locking doors for easy access from the outside of the cage. (Ie: you don\u2019t have to open the main door to get to them.) It also comes with two stainless bowls for the playtop perch. The metal seed guard is removable and I haven\u2019t used it much...but it seems to work okay when I do have it on. However the cage won\u2019t fit through doorways when the seed guard is on lol. It also won\u2019t work if your bird flings seeds horizontally haha. Anyway, another great thing about this cage is the wheels, they are kind of like shopping cart wheels but they do the job. It\u2019s nice to be able to move the cage easily to clean and move him around the house. Overall I think it is an awesome cage for the price and definitely better than most cheaper store bought cages. It is worth the extra few bucks to have a cage that will last, is easy to clean, and will not rust. My last $60 cage was a p.o.s. after a few years. Assembly: It took a little work to put together but it is mostly intuitive. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to put together if you\u2019re a least a tad handy. All the needed tools and screws are included. The only downside I see were the few slight defects where there were tiny parts on a bar where paint was missing, but they do include a touch up paint in the box. Definitely worth the purchase, especially when it is on sale! First Amazon again great accommodations with shipping expidite you really are customer focused. The cage read reviews and so many models and to be honest not sure if the price point was the best but at least competitive and big box stores don\u2019t carry. Being torn between the top 3 manufacturers in this size it was a toss of a coin and in the end this proved to standby my expectations easy to setup larger or should I say roomer than my older one great color goes with my decor the black blends in nice with my mahogany couch and fireplace as it\u2019s has hints of chocolate at least with my eyes \ud83d\ude0e instructions were good easy to follow 30 minutes end to end done. Suggest having a RUBBER mallet for the feet install and even play pen needs some love to put in but expected given the material. Highly recommend my white cockatiel loves it some complained about birds having issue getting from cage to top by them self\u2019s mine it took coaching but once he figure out boom no issue if you see one with yours buy a small Woden ladder lay side ways to rear on top fasten in with tie straps and your bird should be able to navigate fine I purchased the 24\u00d720\u00d760 for my Green Cheek conure. I had purchased the 18\u00d718 for my love birds a year ago so I knew that the quality of the cage was good....however that cage had some defects so I was worried about the new one. The 24\u00d720\u00d760 is the perfect size for my conure. It's an upgrade from the small cage that came with her anyway. The cage itself is still a good quality but it has a few defects as well. The ladder is too long for the top so it pushed on the braces that supports the perch backwards in turn bending the grates below the tray. I'm not sure what happened during manufacturing or if I got a returned one and the replaced just the ladder with the wrong one. But the whole reason I bought this cage was for the top play gym so I'm dissapointed in that part.  The 18\u00d718 cage had spaces on the back that weren't the bar spacing of the rest of the cage and I had to place plastic mesh material over it to keep the love birds from getting their heads stuck. The new cage I don't have that problem with so that was plus. It took a long time to get the holes to line up, and some beating because nothing lined up correctly. Other than that it's a nice cage, good quality, and it's sturdy. They did send me some paint stuff with the new cage, not exactly what that was for and it's not in the directions. I assume it's for color correction if something happens. I'm not sure what Amazon has done with the contact seller button but it's not longer there, just the return option. So I guess I have to live with a bent play gym at the top. Bought 2 of these - one for upstairs and one for down. Very pretty aesthetically - compliments any room. Only complaint is I wish the water and food weren't so close together. My cockatiel has mastered dumping his shells in his water! Next I get to figure out how to clean it - not sure if it'll fit through the bathroom door with the skirt thingy on it. I wish it had a place to store the upper tray, underneath the bottom tray - so it's more open and sunny in the cage if you want it to be. The metal on the skirt is really soft - can't push on it to move the cage without bending it. I'm just careful and it's all good. Overall, I'm very happy with this cage and so is my fine feathered friend! I have to give this cage, Prevue 3151C, 5 out of 5 stars even though I can not use it. It was a breeze to assemble, very sturdy and solid cage and arrived in perfect condition (great job on the packaging). I absolutely love these cages (I have three now). However, I have only had them for a few weeks now. Warning about the size of the 3151 (18X18 Inch) size: I made a mistake in choosing this size for my Sun Conure. I read all the reviews prior to choosing this size and thought it would be ok for her but I was wrong. My Sun Conure is an older bird and is not as active as she use to be, so I did not think she would have a problem downsizing from her much larger cage. I was wrong. Either she is large for a Sun Conure, or other have smaller Suns. By the time I put all her toys and most importantly her bed (Happy Hut), there was barely enough room for her. I rushed when I purchased this cage, because of the great sale price, and for some reason, the next size was over $150 more at the time when the others differed only approx. $50 between sizes. Anyway, I learned I needed to be patient because only a week after I received this cage, 3151C, the next size, 3152C, lowered it's price more than $60. Just my luck. So after a another week, I gave in and ordered the 3152C. Wow, what a difference! So I have to say, in my opinion the 3151C (18X18 inch) cage is much too small for a Sun Conure. I am not sure about a large Cockatiel or other Conure. Now that the sale price has been lowered on the next large size, why not just spend the little difference, I am sure your bird will appreciate it. The only reason I am giving this product 3 stars is because the cage itself is pretty good. Went together easy until I got to the top. The perch for the playstand was missing. Never came in the box. I contacted Plum Struck they offered me a refund if I took the cage apart and sent it back. Anyone who puts together a big bird cage knows what this is like! From looking at the package, you can tell it was a return item. Previously opened and taped up. So many damaged pieces inside. I spent 2 hours bending & straightening pieces of the cage. The pictures speak for themselves. I could add numerous more. I was lucky to have a complete, but wobbly, bird cage. I couldn't return because the box was already torn. ", "This is the best cage that I have had.  My short time experience with it has been wonderful.  My parrot has lots of room and is very content.  I now can leave the door open 24-7 and my bird can climb around outside and inside and be on the play station on top.  I have hung a toy on either side of the top perch and the freedom my parrot has and enjoys is fun to watch.  Tequila has just discovered the handle on the pull out drawer for the play station and likes to sit on the top of the door and mouth the handle.  My parrot also likes to go around on top of the seed catcher and take a tour all the way around. I read almost all of the reviews on this cage before ordering.  I was struggling to determine the right size for our pet cockatiel we are waiting on and was a little worried the cage might arrive damaged or be hard to assemble.  The cage arrived on time and packaged well, the corners were even reinforced with extra packaging.  All pieces arrived in perfect condition.  We ordered the \"sage green\" color and it is beautiful.  My husband assembled the cage by himself in about 20 mins.  All pieces fit and were not bent nor did they need additional holes punctured as I saw in other reviews.  Having the pull out trays will be amazing for clean up.  I will come back and add to this once our baby is ready to bring home, but I am sure the bird will love this cage as much as we do! I bought one of these cages about 7 years ago and I loved it!!!  I just got a new bird in July 2016 so I decided to purchase it again since I was REALLY happy with the first one.  I found this one on AMAZON and this had to come from the \"reject\" bin.  It came with 2 missing Perch's, 2 missing dishes, AND the \"food/dirt catcher\" was missing 2 panels.  The last thing was the door for the cage don't shut right...  I can't close it with one hand because of the imperfection.  I was able to get by and buy an extra perch and food dishes.. but with the 2 panels missing it makes it very easy for my bird to make a mess....  If this company is going to sell their products for discount because they are messed up... then they should tell you that in the description.  If I didn't have another cage made by them then I wouldn't have anything to compare it to!!  I contacted the company and they sent me everything that was messed up....  If the cage was perfect like the first one it would have gotten 5 stars!! I own several Prevue cages and have never been disappointed. I bought the 24\" one for my Caique in November 2019. It's a bit snug since he's so active, so I just purchased the 36\" one for him that should arrive this weekend. This will be his sleeping cage instead. I opted not to use the top tray, I attached a twisted rope perch instead and attached toys - he loves it! I also didn't bother with the seed guards. This cage only had one quality issue, one bar was slightly bent, making it difficult to attach the top. I just used some leverage with the wrench to bend it back enough to fit right. I was able to assemble it alone. Very sturdy! Overall I liked the product. I use it for my green cheek Conure. It's easy to assemble except the last part \"the shield\" was hard to attached. It's easy to clean. There was a strong paint smell. it stayed about one week. I think it's better to wait at least week before you put your bird in. Beautiful cage!  The bird cage came undamaged and was easy to set up.  My cockteil loves his new cage!  I thought he might miss his old cage since he had when he was a baby, but he doesn't want anything to do with it now!  The cage is well built and sturdy.  I looks like the cage is very expensive but I bought it here on Amazon for very little money.  Its a bargain! arrived in herendous condition, bent here, bent there. Was packaged like it was a return. So, I called Amazon who were very willing to take it back but also offered $96 refund. So, I took the refund and my husband and I were able to make the repairs with some J.B. Weld and L brackets, we are now good to go. Cage went together pretty easily. I've purchased several bird cages through the years, this one is average at best. Commercial quality cage.  Very heavy and sturdy.  My only complaint is the color and the assembly.  I would prefer the color to be a solid black.  The black hammer tone is actually a dark grey with silver speckles. We purchased this cage for our new arrival - a cockatiel. Fortunately, we ordered it well in advance of our 'tiel showing up, as the first one we received was damaged. When assembling, the bottom portion has tabs that lock into the legs. Well, one of those tabs was missing, so the bottom portion would not sit into place. So we contacted Amazon, who sent a replacement cage, and we returned the damaged one (at no cost to us, other than time). Although I returned it, I thought this was a really nice cage. Good quality. A trusted brand at an unbeatable price. I liked how the door opened flush and it has a big opening. Also the way the playtop section attaches to the cage better than the a&e which only has a grate that sits on top and then you slide the pan on top of that. Not sure what prevents a bird from pushing up on it and having it fall on their head. Anyways this one is designed best. You don\u2019t have to attach the the bowls, perch and ladder to the playtop which is nice because mine wants no part of that. You also don\u2019t have to attach the seed guard. Another plus is that it comes with a paint brush and a little vial of touch up paint for future knicks and scratches. The only reason I returned it was due to the fact that it was too high. I planned on cutting down the legs but it was still too high. My bird has been in the same spot for most of her 30yrs and the cage just fits there. If it\u2019s too high she can reach the light switch. ", "I love these cages, so far (I have only had the first one for a few weeks now). My birds love them, although they are still afraid on going on the playtop, since they have only had dometop cages prior to these. The cage was easy to assemble, especially after viewing the YouTube video on the assembly of these model cages. I highly recommend viewing this video. It took me maybe 10 minutes to assemble it. It probably helped that I had previous experience after assembling two others just days before. Removing the cage parts from the boxes takes the most time. The packaging was as good as could be done, considering the size and weight of these cages. Unfortunately due the weight of the cage, there were some places in the box the cage pushed through, but no serious damage (just had to bend back one of the u-clips that pushed through the box). These cages are heavy and seem to be built well. This cage, 3152C, was the perfect size for my Sun Conure. I originally had ordered the smaller cage, 3151C (18x18 inch), after reading the reviews regarding the types of birds the cage was for, plus the fact the difference in price for the next size was so much more. I suppose it could have been ok for my Sun Conure but after placing her Happy Hut bed in and a couple toys, it was too crowded to fit her swing inside. I should know better. I like to spoil all my fur and feathered babies, so it really started to bother me after a few days of seeing her in the smaller cage. Luckly for her and me, this cage (3152C) was marked down even more, making it more reasonable compared to the other sizes....so of course, I ordered it. The cage arrived in 2 days, having Amazon Prime. I was a little concerned when the delivery expected date changed to 5 days later, but it arrived on the original date (2 days) anyway. Unfortunately, I had now wasted the money on the smaller cage, which would have been avoided if I had just sucked it up and paid the higher price for this model in the first place, or it would have been great if the sale price of this cage was adjusted before I ordered the smaller size cage. Oh well...live and learn. This review is based only on initial impressions after putting together the cage; however, the most important aspects of it, which are quality of paint, its protection against rust and damage from bird excrement will have to wait for quite a while. The other points to look for in the long term are weld spots and joints of the components. This is a great cage and I definitely recommend it for any conure or cockatiel parents. I have my Green Cheek Conure in the 18x18x57 cage and it is perfect for her. She climbs in, out and all over her cage all day long. There's ample space for toys and perches. Be advised the perches that come with the cage are not of the best quality and there are some manufacturer errors in the design such as bent metal in certain places (which makes putting the cage together a bit of a task). Other than that I definitely plan on purchasing another Prevue Bird Cage when we decide to add another feathered friend to the family. Cage arrived and all was in good shape.  I found it very easy to assemble and did so by myself.  The only part I didn't like was the lack of bars on top to hang toys from top of cage.  The cage is on the dark side due to the playground on top.  My bird is visually impaired so for me this is a non issue.  I needed a cage that she could easily exit with a perch on top and needed the cage to be protected from bird droppings.  My bird can easily maneuver out and onto the top of the cage.  The cage seems like it will be very easy to clean which is important to me.  I purchased different perches of varying sizes and placed them strategically in the cage. Beautiful cage!  I ordered the red and it is a very deep burgundy.  It looks very nice and I can't wait to introduce my bird to the cage.  The instructions were well done and in English.  Most of the parts just slide into place.  There are a few screws and extra screws were included for convenience.  Everything fit where it was supposed to.  It was a little tricky putting the seed catcher together until I realized that the seems go on the outside.  The little hook to keep the bottom grate in place fit easily once I figured out how to put it on- you slip the 2 hooks over the lower bar and the longer bar/hook over the handle.  The box for the first cage was totally bent and banged up.  I didn't even open it.  I contacted Amazon and they took it right back and packaged the 2nd box with corner protectors.  Nothing was bent and the parts fit together perfectly.  This was a terrific purchase and a great price!!! I placed a deposit on an African Grey baby and I had 8 weeks to find her new home. I researched bird cages everywhere I could. I not only went to stores that sold cages, I went to bird vets and breeders to see what brands and types they used. Since the cage brand is not listed in the amazon discription I really had no way to compare apples to apples. What I found was the cage listed in the ad is a Prevue brand. Prevue Hendryx is a very high quality cage that is offered by brand name on several websites for $500-$700 and as much as $899 in pet stores. I found this very brand being used by some of the professionals places of business I spoke of. ($329 + $18 shipping was the best price anywhere, no one else came close) Great home for my soon to arrive Sun Conure.  Assembly was a breeze and fun.  The cage is nicely constructed. I left the 'catchers' off since online video reviews state that such devices tend to collect moist seeds which causes cleaning issues.  I will be making a cage (sides) cover using three washable side curtains with grommets which will  hang on heavy duty magnetic hooks (the top play area prevents conventional cage covers from being used). I opted for the Prevue cage over the  \"Big Deal\" cage, which is similar to this one, because the \"Big Deal\" cage has the big gap for roaming birds to gain access to the yucky tray below. I had very high expectations from all the reviews, but I was disappointed once I unboxed the package. There was no damage to the box from shipping, but I could clearly hear metal peices moving inside the box which was concerning. There were multiple parts that were bent, some of the welds were not even, the wood perches looked like they were starting to rot, and the pewter color I chose did not match the photos. As a large piece of furniture in my living room, I could not settle for something with so many imperfections as it would bother me on a day to day basis. After assembling the cage, I decided to return it and taking the cage apart and repackaging everything proved to be very time consuming and difficult. However, if everything arrived in good condition, this would make an excellent bird habitat. Upon opening this package, the first thing I noticed was a strong odor, not sure what it is but anyone who has parrots knows that odors can be hazardous, so I knew I couldn't put my bird in the cage for awhile until the odor dissipated. Next, I found  there were no instructions or paperwork whatsoever about the cage or how to assemble it.  Upon further opening it, I discovered half the parts were missing, there is supposed to be 4 food dishes, there was not, there was supposed to be 4 brackets to attach the dish holders with and there was not. One side panel was very warped.  Some of the screw holes were not punched all the way through.  Finally, I noticed RUST, yes RUST at half a dozen of the solder connections on the inside of the cage. Another hazard for parrots. The service at Amazon in responding to the issues was good, they are sending a replacement although I told them half an hour after they set that up that I do not want a replacement, the quality of this cage was so poor that I have no faith in the manufacturer (Prevue) to put out a decent cage and I will refuse the replacement.  I went to our local bird shop and paid the extra for a cage that was SAFE and sturdy.  I was sorely disappointed in this cage, apparently Prevue has declined a great deal in the last decade, I won't be buying any of their products anymore. Haven't found anything wrong with this product. Even though the instructions were not in clear English, they gave you plenty of screws, nuts, bolts and the cage is pretty much easy to put together (Even for a dummy like me!) I got it together in 15 minutes. The play gym is AWESOME. My birds love it, however some birds may not be thrilled with a covering (at the top of their cage). I use this for my midsized (greencheek conure) and he has lots of room. This is great for birds who like vertical surfaces (Lovebirds, conures, cockatiels, etc) It was way to small a cage for my amazon parrot. Prevue has always put out some great products and this one doesn't disappoint. Although it says \"Parrot\" cage, it can be very narrow, so I wouldn't recommend it for anything bigger than a conure or quaker (Maybe a ringneck) ", "We have had this same model of cage purchased many different times.  Unfortunately, we have one that came from the MANUFACTURER with a defective weld.  It would not hold one of the bottom parts in the cage properly .  This is the FIRST time we have had an issue with this manufacturer, so I hope between this and the replacement, I can get a good working bird cage together. My sun conure loves his new cage, and I like how easy it is to move the cage around. I can easily roll him back and forth between rooms and keep his cage door open so he can go out/in as he pleases. The playtop is nice and the litter trays and food dishes are easy to remove and clean. Overall it is a great value cage and would give 5 stars, but I have one complaint: I purchased this cage for my Green Cheek Conure.  He is only a baby at 10 weeks old, but I wanted a nice big cage for him.  I think this cage would comfortably fit 2 green cheek conures or 2 slightly bigger birds (Sun Conure).  Definitely not a cage for an adult African Grey or larger parrot.  The largest bird(s) I would place in this cage is a Caique or a pair of them. I spoiled my lovebird a bit and got him a cage that is twice the size of the average lovebird enclosure. He loves it, and can spread his wings and jump place to place. The seed catcher is also super effecting at its job. I wasn't expecting a lot from this cage, given the price and that it had to be assembled. I was expecting something much flimsier, with ill-fitting connections. I was pleasantly surprised. It is heavy enough that a large bird would have difficulty bending the bars (if they were able to at all). It fits together nicely, is easy to operate once you figure out the door latches for the main door and the food and water trays, and wasn't too difficult to assemble. The biggest problem was poor instructions - you could figure out more looking at the picture on Amazon and the Prevue page. I am very pleased with the assembled product, though, and expect to use it for a long time. All the reviews were dead on.  Difficult to put together and holes don't line up.  Dented in place and needed to be touched up with the paint they send with it but still a great design and value.  I bought for my green cheek and once the toys were in, it was a tight space (18x18) so I found another one just like this one (used on Craigslist and put together) and got that as well.  The one that I bought here on amazon is a secondary cage that I use now if I want to move my bird in to a diffent room but again I feel it is too small, even for my little conure, to have it be her full time cage.  Get your little feathered friend the biggest cage your space will hold.  I cannot stress enough that then18x18 is very small.  My conure is a small bird and I would never leave her in there full time.  She is the size of a cockatiel.  The 24 inch cage is perfect for her. We started using this cage in October 2019 and it is now unusable because of the rust. It comes with a very thin amount of powder coating and a little tiny bottle of paint to touch it up. We used all the paint on the thin spots and still with just normal cleaning it is now unusable. We figured the poor quality is due to the fact that it was made in China. I bought this cage to replace one that was far too large for my 2 pet cockatiels. The size of this cage was not only just right for them, but also fits much more easily into the small space I have in my apartment. I looked for awhile for a suitable bird cage for our newly adopted cockatiel. I had an older cage I used for cockatiels I had in the past but it was starting to rust pretty badly. The pet stores had cages around the same price but were flimsy. I wanted something sturdy that my cats wouldn't knock down. When I got this cage it was packed very nicely (no damage at all). The instructions were very simple and easy to understand but after peeking at the instructions I didn't even really use it. It only took 15-20 minutes to put it together. It is very sturdy and nicely weighted. The bar spacing is a not too wide and our cockatiel, Remy, climbs the bars just fine. It has a lot of nice features, including a nice lock for the big cage door, removable trays and wire bottom for easy cleaning, casters for easy maneuvering, seed guard, and a nice playtop. Height wise it hits me at about nose level (I am 5'6\"). Just one side note, I got black but it's more pewter colored but still looks great! I do like how they give you touch up paint just in case but haven't had to use it yet. So happy I decided on this cage! I did not have the problems with bad welds or poor packaging that some other reviewers have had. ", "Lol I never build anything. And I put this together, lol I was so proud. Maybe it is just easy haha. Built in under an hour, and super white. Mine had a few bends and dings but I managed to make it fit. I have one cockatiel in there she can spread her wings. But I would definitely say this is the minimum size. I let her out quite a lot. Other reviewers comments about assembly were our experience too - directions were not the most detailed and I am not mechanically inclined. We had our contractor assemble the birdcage as he was doing some remodeling for us, Love the bird cage and love the color. We were a little anxious how our African Gray parrot would take to his new home - we need not have worried. We decided ti leave the top tray off because 'Baby'  likes to travel upside down over the top part of the cage and wouldn't do it with the top on. Great size - a little larger than our original cage. Love the skirts around the sides that help catch the seeds. The new cage is much easier to clean. Nice touch how the food and water bowls have their own door.  Would definitely recommend this cage. I read the reviews before buying and took a chance with others reviews based on a good price for this cage. I think everyone who was missing hardware I got it lol. Lots of extra screws and nuts, directions kinda sucked but most do. I got this cage for my Goffin Cockatoo to have a day cage in my living room.  This cage is much smaller than his normal and sleeping cage, but it's still very large for him.  He loves it.  He watched me assemble it from his perch and was eager to test it out.  He has plenty of space to live and hang out in, but not really lots of space to flap his wings with hanging toys.  It has plenty of vertical space, I may get him another perch for the bottom of the cage so he can maybe be able to flap his wings.  The feeding bowls inside the cage are very deep.  The cage has a locking mechanism that prevents my bird from escaping so far without the need for industrial locks, but I usually keep an open cage policy when I'm around.  I should really knock off a star because the cage did come with a few bent areas and parts... but a vice-grip locking wrench was able to fix it to be functional. It's size would probably be fine for a main cage for a Goffin Cockatoo, but I think my birdie will prefer his resort sized cage more. This cage is sitting disassembled in my garage and ready to be taken to my community's bulky trash facility.  While it was a good size, it rusted fairly quickly and therefore was not a healthy environment for my parrot.  I hated knowing that her cage was substandard.  Save yourself some money and aggravation by buying a good quality cage from the start.  King's Cages, for example, has a much better level of quality control, and their service is responsive.  If you get this cage, set aside a few hours for assembly, because I agree with others who have noted it's a real pain to put together. So far so good. I would definitely recommend putting this together away from your bird. There is a pretty strong chemical/packaging smell from it right out of the box. The directions are relatively easy to follow and no special tools are required for assembly. The construction of the cage is pretty awesome. We had a hard time with the very top of the cage (the bottom of the playcenter) getting it to line up and fit correctly. We eventually got it. Just for a size reference...I stand 5'3\" and the perch on the very top is eye level with me. Its a pretty good sized cage for a GCC or smaller bird. So buying things online isn\u2019t always what you expect. We were a little skeptical about this product. Bought it and put it together. This product is great. Easy to assemble, very sturdy and seems to be of good quality and should last. If you\u2019re on the fence buy it. It\u2019s worth the extra money for a cage of this quality. I rarely take the time to type a review but I owed this company this because they did a nice job of putting this product together and getting it on the market. Very pleased. This may just be my birds, but they tend to like to be as high as possible. This cage has a lot of vertical space, but not much horizontal space. The bottom half of the cage pretty much never gets used. The birds pretty much all stay at the same level. I got this cage today and I couldn\u2019t be happier! Its extremely well made and sturdy! I have a conure in it and she loves it! Lots of room for her toys too!  I\u2019ve read a lot of reviews where  people say the cage arrived damaged or missing parts but my cage arrived very well packaged. The box had reinforced corners on the outside of it and all the parts inside the box were wrapped with bubble wrap.  Maybe the quality control has definitely gotten better on making sure these cages are packaged properly so they don\u2019t get damaged in transit. Definitely the best money I\u2019ve ever spent for a bird cage!! 2 Days to Hawaii!  Wow, can't beat that!  We are happy with this purchase, came in two days, and only minor issues to the packaging and or framing of the birdcage.  Packaging held up, but had two 2\"diameter wholes in the box due to the content puncturing through during shipment.  The strapping and the corner cardboard protecters seem to help keep it together.  As for the cage, we had no real issues with bent framing, other than having to use a plier to flatten out slightly bent metal, where you slip the sides of the cage down through the guide rails.  My daughter loves her birthday gift for her dilute conure. :) ", "I had purchased a cheaper cage of similar design (but smaller in dimensions) in the past and found several manufacturing flaws in it. The Prevue cage is superior to that other one. This cage assembled easily and the instructions were adequate. Fit and finish is overall very good. The material and finish coating seem of better quality. The color is uniform overall. I only found two problems, as shown in the photos. One of the bolts securing the play platform to the top of the cage went in easily. The rest were difficult to get threaded and bolted in, with one (photo) bolt hole so off center it could not be used at all. One of the provided wooden perch rods was very warped (photo), which, honestly, will be no problem as we hadn't planned on using them anyway. Overall, we are very pleased with this cage and hope the Sun Conure baby will find it a good home. I put it together by myself and I\u2019m 66. It wasn\u2019t easy but I did it and I love it. So easy to clean. We got a piece of plastic like you put under a desk chair, and cut it into pieces to fit the drawers. I just pick those up each morning and dump off dropped food, wipe it down to get rid of droppings and it\u2019s clean. Sure beats what I went through with my other cages. My bird loves it, especially the top perch. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone with a Senegal or larger parrot. So worth the money. Ethan my cockatiel loves his new home. Very easy to assemble, parts are very good quality. This was the second Prevue bird cage I purchased. The Prevue brand is a bit more expensive so when I had to buy a second bird cage, I opted for the cheaper brand. Well the cheaper brand arrived all damaged. The packaging of the cheaper brand was poorly done...so it did not survive the shipping process. I decided to purchase this cage for my cockatiel based on the awesome reviews it had received. I was expecting something high quality, but when it arrived I was blown away. The quality and sturdiness of this cage surpassed all expectations I could possibly have for a birdcage. Plus it's aesthetically pleasing and doesn't look nearly as tacky as some of the smaller plastic bottom/think wire models they sell at most pet stores. I could not recommend this product more to anyone looking for a high-quality birdcage. Plus the directions were super easy to follow and it only took about 30-45 minutes, even while being super careful and slow so as to avoid any mistakes. Everything fit together just as the directions said and the finished product feels so sturdy and high quality. Some real fit and finish issues, and some of them are bad enough to have to return the cage. I expected bent pieces in a factory sealed box from some of the reviews, and I got them. Not the end of the world... However, I had to drill and tap new holes to fit all the main, long torx screws into their adjoining pieces, as they were not done to size or threaded at the factory! If I didn't happen to have the correct bits, the cage could not have gone together and I would have been forced to try and repack it into the box for a return, which would be all but impossible and it would be getting 1 star. It's a decent enough cage for the money; assuming you get one that is not mangled and has correctly sized screw holes. I bought the cage and it had rust all over it and We are getting our first bird, a beautiful Lutina Cockatiel, in about two weeks. I bought this cage in anticipation of this.  I received the cage within 3 business days and I have to say it is more than I thought it would be!  It was packaged great, no problems with anything being scratched up or bent. It was very easy to assemble.  I did try to put it together by myself but did end up needing my hubby's help because it is hard to hold onto and put together at the same time.  It is an absolutely beautiful, sturdy, cage.  A few people that have seen it already thought it looked like a $400 cage.  I would very much recommend.  You won't be sorry! I'll try to come back as soon as we get our birdy and update on how he/she likes it. The cages are extremely sturdy and does not feel or look cheap. Also, cleaning the cages is super easy and fast as well as feeding and moving the cages from one place to another. I use Glad Press\u2019 N seal for the bottom tray. When I opened the packaging it had a strong odor. I do not suggest opening the packaging near your bird. I wiped down the cage with a wet warm cloth to remove the odor. Unfortunately, both cages were a little bit chipped. I painted the chipped areas with the paint provided to avoid rusting and left it overnight to dry and wiped it down. My sun and green cheek conure are extremely happy with their new cage! I highly recommend this cages! i opened the box and saw a thousand pieces but i must say it was not hard to put together. the wheels have a very strong rubbery scent like a new tire smell. everything fit perfectly no issues and NO DAMAGE. it was packed/protected well during shipping. overall very nice not so huge cage but good size. definitelty recommended.  photo is without the wheels i added them shortly after. I love this cage, it\u2019s color, and it\u2019s attributes like the button unlock cage, easy access bowls, and the pull out drawers for quick cleaning. I\u2019m glad I decided with the bigger size too. Easy to assemble but it is heavy and is definitely faster and safer with two or more people assembling. I was a bit nervous because I bought it used but it was very clean and had all it\u2019s parts along with extra screws. Some pieces were a little warped but nothing too serious or unworkable. I couldn\u2019t seem to make the ladder straight on the top though and there were some dents on the bottom pan, which was a bit annoying, but as said, not serious. The package came with paint to clean up scratches or spots on the cage which was very nice, although I hope the paint is safe just in case my bird decides to chip some of it off. The smell of it was really strong. All in all, beautiful cage and I hope my soon-to-come cockatiel will like it too. Will update review if there are any changes. ", "Saw same brand bird cage at our local pet store but sizes were  too small or too big.  We found the perfect size here and took a chance and purchased. It's exactly what we wanted.  It is plenty big for my 3 cockatiels and one parakeet.  They get along so we were looking to move them all in to one cage.  It arrived well packaged.  One leg was a little bent, and one bar was bent. Still the quality of this is excellent, it is made well, sturdy.  The latch is spring loaded and works fine...I am concerned that perhaps sometime in the future it could wear out but for now it works.  Highly recommend despit a few bends.  The instructions that come with this are not that great, but you can defintilty figure it out!  We used the Amazon picture to help guide us a bit. It is perfect for the baby cockatiel that my granddaughter has. I love easy access to the water and food bowls through small doors on the sides. I also live the seed catcher as well as the drawers that allow for easy clean up. In addition to the perches inside, this cage also has a perch on the top(outside) as well as a ladder, seed and water dishes and another drawer for easy cleaning! I almost forgot to mention that it's also on casters for ease of movement. The only negative was that assembly was difficult with 1 person but doable with 2. In fairness to the manufacturers,  they did recommend that the assembly be by two... I have 3 Greencheek Conures and they all had different sized cages plus I couldn't fit them all in the space I have them in together. I thought I'd go ahead and get 3 matching cages. I had worked at a pet store previously and had to assemble cages daily usually by myself so I already knew who to turn to! I bought all 3 in the black hammertone and they arrived together. Took about 1.5 hours to build ALL 3 with my husband. Easy to assemble minus the playtop part that attaches to the cage itself. On 2 of the cages the pieces you fit into each other wouldn't fit but we just hammered it a bit flat which is no big deal. We already put the one in the smallest cage in her new cage and she loves loves loves it. The other 2 will go in theirs later. I received this cage on 10/29/18. Delivery was fast.The Cage was damaged as much as possibe.Most of the cage bars were crooked.Please look at pics of the tray.  The cage lock was damaged as well.Besides that ,the bottom of the tray does not stay secure.Whenever I want to clean it falls down on the floor.My bird likes to eat while he is sitting on the tray.I put some of  his favorite food on the tray so he could it the tray fall down with my bird. It arrived damaged - with one of the large panels significantly bent.  Given the heavy weight and hassle of packing it all up again for return, we hammered the bend out as best we could with a rubber mallet.  As others have mentioned, the instructions included were for some other cage.  This left us to figure it out on our own.  It took much longer than expected to put it together due to a lot of screw holes not matching up, lack of proper instructions, missing pieces, etc.  This was especially true of the top, outer assembly, where none of the screw holes matched up at all and the required screws were not included. We found we needed to use pliers in certain areas.  Overall, assembly was a hassle perhaps equal to packing the cage up for return! I love this cage! I already had an older model but wanted to upgrade to a shiny new model as the older one was finally rusting after 10 years and some hard scrubbing. It was super easy and quick to assemble; but I had 2 other people helping me. I would not want to try it alone but it would be possible. It is very sturdy and I love the door lock and added security that the door lock stop at the top of door adds. Now I do not have to worry about my dogs accidently letting my bird out. Overall a great purchase and very spacious!. I don't use the bottom grate as my green cheeked conure loves to walk and play on the bottom. Purchased cage for our African Grey. Very sturdy and well built. Easy to put together once you are able to decipher the instructions. They need a bit more information. Although there are a few illustrations it is not clear which screws to use. Instructions call for nuts, not screws. And there are no instructions at all for seed catcher. Luckily my husband is experienced with assembling the cage for our Blue Front Amazon so he was able to put the seed catcher on. This would have been a bit of a chore for an inexperienced person I am sure. Beautiful Cage for a spoiled Cockatiel. The contents were extremely well packaged, protected and arrived in pristine condition. All contents were listed and accounted for per the SO SO instructions. Included along with the screws and nuts was a brush and touch up paint which were not needed thanks to the perfect condition of the pieces. Anticipating a big assembly project, I enlisted my favorite handyman and we proceeded to tackle the task at hand. Meh... It went together so quickly that I was almost embarrassed at having asked for help. UNTIL we began to assemble the seed guard. This was the single worst part of the entire assembly. The parts were poorly designed and required bending to line up the screw holes. WE MADE IT WORK. It took longer to finish this part of the cage than it did to unpack, sort and assemble the main component. The play structure on top of the cage is awesome and provides the perfect place for my feathered friend to perch, and includes two metal food /water bowls. The interior includes two additional metal food/water cups and one wooden perch.The end result is BEAUTIFUL. Worth every penny and the  energy spent to complete this cage. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I have added two additional food containers, a swing,  four types of perches (one is a heated gravel type), three toys, and STILL have tons of room to roam for my happy birdie. The color is not as light and minty as the picture shoes. It's much prettier, a bit deeper in color but the shade is true to the photo. Let me say that this cage is big, bigger than I thought it would be. I'm okay with that though because as a bird lover I know that there is no such thing as \"too big\" when talking a birds home. I purchased this for my Sun Conure that will soon be here to stay with me. I will update my rating after he gets here. I have one very spoiled cockatiel who LOVES his castle! He has so much room to explore and tons of toys/mirrors to keep him busy while we are working. We keep the cage door open for him when we are home, he sits on it like it's his front porch. It is very easy to clean and move around. It has been about a year now since we've had this cage, I am still very happy with my purchase! ", "After reading all the reviews, the only concern seemed to be bent bars and difficult assembly. I went ahead and ordered the cage anyways. The cage arrived on time. all the pieces were in the box and in perfect shape. everything fits perfectly. It took less than an hour to put the entire cage together using no tools at all except the hex key that comes with it. there are extra screws and nuts provided. If you are looking for a cage this is perfect. I have a Green Cheek Conure and he loves it. this cage is the smallest in the series but it is big enough for any conure or small parrot. I love this cage for my Green Cheek Conure. I bought the black hammertone color. It's very sturdy & looks nice. We actually got compliments on this cage when it was still totally empty! I can't live without the swing out feeder doors. I love the smooth rolling casters that don't damage my linoleum floors and I love the dual lock system. We usually just use the swing latch above the door, but will use the actual lock if kids come over. Releasing the lock on the door is fairly loud and could be \"jarring\" for your bird, but you can easily cushion the blow by placing your finger at the other end of the lock before pressing the release. We attempted for about 2 minutes to assemble the seed guard \"just 'cause\" but gave up pretty quickly as we didn't feel they were necessary and I had read they were a beast to assemble. The instructions require a little common sense as the literature is vague, but it's definitely doable in 30-60 minutes with another person. One of the side panels was a little bent, but once slid into place it straightened out just fine. We had very little, if any, damage to our cage upon delivery. I will actually be sizing up to the Prevue 3154, which is the same cage design, but considerably larger. This one will still be in use as a sleep cage, sun cage, and/or for visiting the in-laws. I looked at all sorts of other flight cage brands when I decided to size up, but I just LOVE this one so much that I couldn't break away. None Great cage!! My blue quaker loves it. Arived on time, box was a little banged up, but no damage to cage. First, this is the second cage, the first one never came!  Next, the instructions were less than sufficient, pictures were difficult to make out also.  When we were putting it together, neither one of the perches fit the cage or the top perch.  We had to cut one of them to fit, the other one was way too short to use ANYWHERE!  The design of the cage isn't very good either.  The dishes that are inside the cage are attached to their doors which I like but there's no way to put a perch in front of those dishes for the bird to get to them!!  Luckily, I had one of those screw in perches that only needs one side screwed in so I was able to get around that problem.  I had to dig up old perches THAT FIT to put in the cage.  I didn't want OLD anything in her new cage but............anyway, REALLY, for over $150 you'd think, at least, you'd get what the picture shows! So. I would not suggest this cage to anyone, unless you want to go out and buy one of those single sided, screw in perches and be prepared to do some cutting to give your little friend a perch on top. Our Quaker loves it. We bought this cage to upgrade from the wire cage given to us when we adopted our rescue quaker parrot. We are so very pleased with this cage. The quality is excellent. We shopped for cages for months now. We went to pet stores and looked and read reviews of dozens of cage models and makers. We went with this since the overall reviews were good, there was a youtube video that showed us exactly what we were purchasing, and it was a great price overall. We are so glad we made this choice. Our baby took a bit to warm up but today his first full day in it and he is doing just fine. The instructions are a bit undetailed but if you are savvy and handy, it really is not a problem. If you are like me (the hubby is the savvy and handy one) you can view a youtube video on the assembly. Just type the cage model in search and you will see a man who walks you through it step by step. We noticed that in shipping one side of the frame was slightly bent and made the latch a bit difficult. But we made it work just fine and I called Amazon and they were the best at customer service and gave us a discount for the issue. We also saw a review that stated something about sharp parts on the bars, we didn't find a thing. We checked every inch and the only thing we saw was where the paint drip and dried and it was a bit sharp. And this was just 1 tiny tiny tiny spot. If you just scrap it off and use the touch up paint, you wont have a issue. You will not be sorry with this purchase!!! I purchased this about a month ago for my Quaker parrot when it was on sale with free shipping.  She loves it. It is a bigger cage than we probably needed, but toys do take up internal space and there's still plenty of room for her to move around and stretch her wings. I am partial to playtop cages as my birds are only caged for sleep and when no one is home. It gives them personal space while allowing them to interact with eachother and me. The play area has an easy to clean tray and offers a lot of room for toys as well.  I do line trays with newspaper to keep the poop and food off the metal and empty the tray daily. When I first received the cage I took stock of the damaged items...one of the huge treys had a nasty dent, and some of the wiring was a little out of whack. I hammered out what I could and then proceded to try and assemble the cage....THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG. In my manual it says to secure the frame together using steel nuts. Don't do this, the holes are all designed only to be screwed in, and if you use the nut...you'll get the worst fitting cage ever. Got this cage for an African Grey we adopted.  We had a large cage outside but with years of sun and wind, paint is all powdery. ", "I bought the 30\"x22\"x63\" cage and I must say it's impressive. Plenty of room for my Sun Conure and fits a lot of toys to keep him busy. The cage did come a little bit damaged from shipping however I was able to bend the pieces back to how they needed to be with a hammer or pliers. I can't say enough good things about this cage, it rolls anywhere you need it to go and is heavy enough to not be moved by my dogs and cat. The bird feels very safe in it and can fly within the cage if he desires. The birds happiness was my top priority and even though this cage is pricey it was definitely worth it. This has been an awesome upgrade for our conure. His last cage was significantly bigger, but he seems much happier in this one. I especially like that the playstand above has food and water dishes and it's own tray to collect debris. We have a much more content bird since purchasing this cage! The poop guards on the sides are also especially helpful because that was always an issue before. Overall, a great value for the money. I have had other Prevue cages and never had a problem.  This size was big enough to put my two conures in since they were always in each others cages anyway and they seem to enjoy being together.  I am a senior female and I put it together myself it took me about two hours tops, would have been less if I had help, but it wasn't difficult. Instructions were terrible. If you are not mechanically inclined you may have some difficulty assembling the unit. Seed guard was dented and unusable. I expected a better quality product for the price tag. This is an amazing cage for the price.  I have spent much more on my other cages and they are smaller and not as good.  First, this cage is a great size.  Plenty of room for my Goffin's Cockatoo to play.  Then, the door locks are perfect for a smart and curious birdie.  There are two different mechanisms to keep the main door closed and the main one is spring loaded and cannot be reached with a beak.  The food door latches also cannot be reached from inside.  The wire gauge and spacing is wonderfully safe for a medium sized bird. Finally, it was very easy to assemble and is very sturdy.  I love this cage so much I bought another from the same brand for my other birdie. After reading other reviews I was a little worried. The cage came with all parts, nothing bent or broken. I found it pretty simple to put together. One of the panels was a little confusing where the food bowls go. (Make sure your lock faces down) my cinnamon cheek conure loves it and I would put it together a million times again before I paid the prices they want for the same cage at the pet store. I hesitated buying this cage because of the 1-star and 2-stars comments.  It arrived yesterday,and today my daughter and I followed the instructions with out a mishap nor frustration.  the cage is very sturdy and the the parts were all there.  no damaged parts.  I am delighted with my investment.  I would recommend this cage for a small parrot. I guess it depends on what you're used to. I'm trying to get a new cage for my Cockatiel (he's been in his for 10 years, and it's starting to show its age), and this seemed like a good bet. Not only was it much smaller than I expected (I did measure it out before purchase), but it arrived damaged. The top bar on one side was badly dented, and the pieces that I did put together didn't fit well; the screws didn't line up with the holes, which was very frustrating. Also, they include a thing of touch up paint, and mine exploded in transit which was something of a mess. Overall, the quality of the cage is disappointing, but that may also be partly because my current cage is very sturdy. I'm just grateful for Amazon's return policy! I read all the reviews before purchasing. I was a little skeptical but purchased anyway,(24x20) it came with the box roughed up by UPS but it survived thanks to good packaging. I put it together by myself (a 2nd person would have been easier) it took about an hour. I purchased it as replacement cage for my green cheek (petey) it is a great cage for the money and Petey took to it right away. I'm going to buy the next size larger (30x22) for my double yellow head (ringo). the only con that I found is I wish it had storage underneath. THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE Packages arrived looking like they had been through the Delta baggage handlers at the airport and several parts inside were damaged. Per the enclosed material, I contacted Prevue Pet Products for assistance. Customer service there really stepped up to the plate and replaced all the damaged items. Replacement parts arrived in good condition. Cage is well made with the exception of some minor issues fitting the components together. ", "I've purchased a number of cages over the past 15 years and this is one of the nicest of them all.  It was a little expensive so I got the hammered black which cost less, but I had just recently gotten the Preview Parrot perch that only came in this color so they ended up making a nice color coordinated area for my bird.  This is probably the first cage I ever had shipped to me that was not damaged, in fact, it was in perfect condition and also easy to assemble.  Whatever color you choose, this particular cage is a very good investment, and I believe you won't regret buying it.  Oh, I would give it 5 stars except for the color, but you may prefer it. It took me forever to decide on a cage for my cockatiel, though I can say I'm definitely pleased with my purchase. It wasn't too bad to assemble (I did it by myself) and it looks great.  The cage arrived in great condition with no damage. You may have to finesse some of the screws, though with patience, I assure you the cage will fit together nicely. This is definitely a nice cage for the price. I  first got one for my Indian Ringneck Parakeet; I liked it so much that I got a second one for my Sun Conure! Honestly, assembly can be a pain in the rear as sometimes the metal arrives bent and the instructions enclosed seem to be meant for another cage with different parts. Common sense, patience, and a lot of swearing eventually paid off. Once it's finally assembled, it's a great cage, very spacious and sturdy. Overall, I am quite happy with this cage, in fact I've ordered a second one to replace an old cage. I have the black Hammertone color and it is solid and looks great (doesn't look cheap). It comes together pretty well, but the one-sided sheet of instructions was bush! Seriously, take a few deep breaths before you get started and take your time. In all it took 20-30 min to erect the cage. That and the fact that the seed catcher is not perfect are the only drawbacks for me. Things I really like about it include the fact that it doesn't need a table or stand, it has wheels to move it for cleaning, it has a seed catcher-its not perfect, but its much better than having nothing, its a nice size for 2 cockatiels with enough room for our 3rd to spend the day with her buddies, and go to her own cage at night. Very easy put together and keep clean. Perfect size for my needs. I have an umbrella cockatoo who is out most of the day. I love that I can easily move the cage around. Cleans perfectly with a hose. I wouldn't recommend this size for birds larger than conures or cockatiels, though, if they are in their cage most of the day. Came without adequate packaging and was damaged, one of the tabs that hold side wall was crushed flat had to use channel locks and a hammer/block to straighten. The seed barrier is warped/ bent corners don't align to well. Very happy with the cage overall. It was fairly easy to assemble and has been easy to clean. There were some dents in the metal tray and bent bars possibly from shipping. It\u2019s a sturdy and secure cage, fits great on a weather tech all purpose mat! The cage catches about 50% of debris (seeds, etc.). I like the play station on top and the individual doors for the food and water bowls so you don\u2019t always have to reach through the cage. Our Quaker loves her new cage! I wasn\u2019t if it would be big enough based on some of the photos but it is the perfect size. I included some photos to show her size in comparison to the cage. It was a two person job to assemble. I appreciate that they include a small jar of touch up paint. Only issue I have is the seed barriers don\u2019t seal all the way and sometimes seed or dried bird droppings fall on the floor while I clean instead of into the tray. But that would not prevent me from recommending this. This cage is bigger than I had anticipated. I have a quaker & parakeet inside, but it would be ideal for African Grey/Amazon size as well. My quaker is spoiled and I am gone during the day, so I wanted this size. Assembly was surprisingly easy and the wheels are a nice addition. The guardrails do help a little bit with throwing seeds. Large bowl sizes and they lock in, which is nice if your bird is an instigator like mine. The trays are easy to clean and the upper play portion is great when you're home but don't want your bird on you. I would definitely recommend this cage. I did have an issue with shipping, and the sending called to correct it right away. My only complaint is they didn't have the color I really wanted in stock and they didn't do much to provide me with other options. Our cage arrived quickly considering we live in Hawaii and good size for our conure so that was some pluses.  Took 2 stars off for the multiple damaged/bent parts in the iron (This was very disappointing to see) and the latches on the door of the dishes are very easy to open that I expect our bird to be able to get them open so we will have to apply additional fasteners to the dish doors.  Other than that cage seems very sturdy and its tall. ", "Do NOT wash this cage thinking you\u2019re having a good spring cleaning day! We purchased this cage a few years back. Within a year, the latching piece for the food dishes fell off. For the past few years, we\u2019ve been using bent paper clips to keep it closed. Finally, I said enough is enough and I ordered a new one. I absolutely love this cage ! I am so happy I bought this for my bird.  He deserved an upgrade and he is loving it.  It\u2019s such a gorgeous and sturdy cage and not  flimsy at all.  The box it came in was very heavy and I actually had my cousin and her husband come over and he put it together for me.  It\u2019s a great size for my lovebird.  And he has plenty of room.  The grate slides out easily and so confit when it comes to cleaning it For the price, it is well worth it. With the video you can find online, it was pretty easy to assemble, minus a few slip ups of my own. Mine was not bent at all and slid into place pretty well. It is exactly what I was expecting, solid and good quality product. The only issue is that the perch bar that goes on top of the play top was built wrong for me. I could only put one of the perch food bowls in because my bar had one hole drilled in the wrong place (i checked multiple times and it was not because i set up the top wrong!.) But it was not the biggest deal to me as the play top food bowls did not matter too much to me. But it is possible to have defects! Some bent parts but didn't cause a problem with assembly, which didn't take much time.  Top wouldn't attach since holes didn't match up but it's heavy so no problem. Biggest problem was it needed a lot of touch up paint. Multiple areas were not fully sprayed and the metal showed thru. Very disappointing paint job. I guess quality control wasn't working the day this one was painted. Would have given 4 stars if not for the sub par paint job. It is nice and roomy for the birds though, they are very happy. Bought this cage for a black capped conure. Got the small sage green cage for a great price. Came with a few bent pieces, but we were able to get it together in under an hour. It was missing one rubber thing that goes on the bottom of the leg and attaches the castor wheel, making it impossible to attach the 4th wheel. Too difficult To remove other wheels after putting them in, so we had a wobbly cage (cue rage, followed by \u201cmeh\u201d). We\u2019ll  look into a replacement part or some sort of diy solution. Til then, the leg is supported by a cigar box, ha. This is a really top notch cage that is well worth the price, in fact, best I've seen in this price range.  My 19 year old Red Spectacled Amazon has just gotten so excited with the play area and nice size.  The seed trap is a bit of a pain to clean, as it turns out ole Harpo likes to hang over the edge to poop.  Harpy is wheeled into the sunroom daily, the rollers work very well traversing the carpet from wood floors. My parrots likes this upgrade.. it is a sturdy case and was easy to assemble however the paint seems to be peeling off at a few spots.  The seed catcher is not very efficient,  so I took it off. Overall a great buy, i saw it was almost 25 bucks cheaper on wayfair. I would like if the seller can match the price. 24x20x60---  After a long time searching i settled on this cage. I think its a solid cage overall, some pieces come a little bent and some of the holes were not punched all the way through.  But not a huge deal, i was able to get everything back in order.... It doesnt take long to put together, certainly would be helpful if you had a second person holding things in place.  I ran into a few confusing things with the playtop and the seed catchers but eventually figured it out with pictures and videos.  I ultimately left off the seed catchers because it didnt fit in the space i needed it to, it really bulked up the cage.  My cockatiels seem to love it. Very happy with how strong the cage is, high quality stainless bowls, and sturdy litter shelves.  Large front door makes cleaning and hanging toys very simple for a large cage (I'm reviewing the largest option in White).  Don't underestimate the depth of the largest one -- a full 32\" away from the wall is more than you might expect. That distance is with the optional debris catchers installed (recommended but they do add a lot to how far from the wall the cage sticks out). ", "I bought this cage for my GCC and was very pleased with it at first. Then the paint started chipping on the grate after maybe 6 months. I do sometimes use a scrubby sided sponge when cleaning, so I assumed it was my own fault. However, after about 8 months, the door where her water dish is has gotten really rusty! I have still not quite had it a year so the fact that I already have 2 issues, one of which is a serious safety hazard for my bird, is unacceptable! I don't want to have to buy another new cage after only a year with this one so hopefully the company responds soon and will do something to compensate me. I bought this birdcage for my African Grey Timneh. He is quite a talkative birdie who needs to be properly spoiled. It was quite easy for me to assemble myself even though the directions suggest 2 people. (The less coordinated of us may want to have a helper.) This cage gives ample room for little twerp to do his birdie business. It came with one wooden perch to go inside of the cage. I then tricked out the cage with a couple more perches and a bunch of birdie toys. Love this cage I got it for my Quaker and he has lots of room and he is enjoying the rooftop play area. He seems happy and for that it makes me happy. I recommend this bird cage. Easy to assemble easy instructions to follow and everything was there no missing pieces. This cage was scheduled for Sunday delivery and came within 24 hrs. After reading so many reviews it looks like there is a mix up between a cheaper version of the cage sold by Super Deal Pro and Prevue Pet Products. I'm extremely satisfied with my Prevue cage. We bought a $500+ acrylic bird cage - thinking it would be less messy (birds tend to fling their food). Big mistake!  The acrylic cage also traps in the moisture and SMELL!  And we still had a big mess to clean up every time we changed the bottom papers. THIS cage is great!  A few things land on the floor still-but it is SO MUCH EASIER to keep clean. And our Black Headed Caique LOVES IT! Great cage. Easy to assemble if you've built your fair share of IKEA furniture. Only bad thing was a small oil bottle inside had exploded and stunk so bad. The fumes burned my eyes so I took the box outside. One of the bowls is covered in it and I can't get it clean. But apart from that, whole cage was in great condition and assembled without trouble. Bird loves it. The medium one is HUGE! :) I looked at all kinds of bird cages and their prices.  This one turned out to be perfect for my area. It's made really well and didn't break the bank in buying it.  The only con is that the  perch does not fit in front of the feed dish and water.  It is ok because my cockatiel  sits on the edges of the dishes. She likes her playground at the top of the cage. Putting the cage together was a little confusing at first but my boyfriend came to the rescue and did the job in a couple of hours. I absolutely love this. It looks stunning on my hardwood floor in front of the front window. I got this for my messing Cockatiels (even though vacuuming is needed once every one to two days) but the tray does help hold in a lot of the seeds from the messy eaters and some feathers from their preening. Great cage overall but not easy to clean. I have to take it outside and literally hose it off from time to time.  Its actually way too large for my conure. I should have purchased the smaller one. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon open box one to save some money. It wasn\u2019t complete and had to be sent back. You can always tell it isn\u2019t all there until you\u2019ve partly assembled and then have to take it back apart and re-package. Total pain. The platinum is a silver color. Think this cage is a quality one though! Seed skirts are rounded corner and many aren\u2019t. ", "It arrived with some minor dings and chips in the paint, hence the 4 stars, but we were able to assemble it just fine after a little wiggling. The slight damage hasn't ruined the overall integrity of the cage. I bought this for my adult son who has an African Gray parrot. I was with him when he put it together and it is such a huge improvement over the homemade wood-and-screen cage the bird came to him in. It is SO WELL MADE. A few connections needed to be bent back into the proper shape. But a needle nose pliers worked great to do that. Whoever designed this thing was really thinking! So many destructive things that parrots can do with their cages are foiled by the design. I agree with other reviewers that it's better to have 2 people help put it together. Peeps took to the cage immediately. I Googled the cage before purchase. Only Walmart.com had it for the same price but delivering it to my son's home would have cost extra. Of course, Amazon has \"Super Saver Shipping\" and it arrived 4 days after I ordered it!! My son tells me this is THE BEST gift I've ever given him! That makes mom happy!!! Great product! Love the sage green. Cage is solid but came not just bent but with breaks at wire connection points in two places. A welded corner wedge necessary for proper assembly of components was completely broken off, requiring a workaround. With workarounds it serves its purpose. So wire is generally strong and cage looks good, but there are important design flaws Lovely big cage! I have a conure and he walks around it just fine! There were some parts that came in a little bent but we quickly fixed them with some pliers. Metal is sturdy! Very convenient slots to take out all the bird droppings and the perch on top is awesome! Love it! Greta price too! Try finding one of these at a store for less then 300$. You would have to have coupons for days! This is a very nice, sturdy cage at a very affordable price.  My husband had it put together in less than an hour and the only problem with it was the touch up paint had opened and leaked into one of the dishes.  It was easily cleaned up with a brillo pad however so all is well.  They should think about putting the paint into a sealed plastic bag in case it opens.  But overall we are very happy with this purchase and our parrot loves it.  Whoever designed it clearly knew their parrots, from the push button/slide handle on the door that he will never be able to open, to the pull out grate for easy cleaning that clips so it can't be pushed out and the bars over the food dishes to keep them from being tipped. Best of all the seed catchers that keep all the mess inside the cage!  If you are thinking about buying this cage don't hesitate, it is a lot of cage for a reasonable price. Great cage for my Jenday Conure! He stays in here durin the night to sleep or rainy day! I am glad I got this good size for my baby and it is easy for me to change the food & water and clean the cage! All the food drop are catched on the tray atatch to tge cage outside, slide all go into the bottom of the cage! Love this very much! Yes,  I can recommend this! I ordered this cage for way less here than any other sites. Some Bird sites are selling it for over $400 and I paid $172. I love that it comes in different colors, so got one to match our kitchen. Nice quality cage for the price.  As other reviewers have noted, parts were a little bent from shipping. Side panels were slightly bent, a tab was bent. My strong husband had to muscle these parts to get everything to fit. Got it together, took about half an hour - didn't want to put the seed catchers on. Minimal touch up. The cage smells slightly toxic and so does touch up paint, so we'll let it off gas for a little while before we put our conure in it. I am being picky here but i feel like their quality control is lacking a little bit. had 2 holes which were not fully cleared and had to use a punch tool to unblock so be ready to do some fixing.  If i could i would only remove half a star for this issue. ", "Update: The cage itself, is wonderful, high-quality and easy to clean. However, mine came slightly not ready (one hole for a food dish had not been drilled in a piece) and though I tried to rectify it myself, and then contacted the company about it - replying to numerous requests for additional information about the replacement part needed because I didn't buy it from them, I have never received the part. They were very polite, but in the long-run, did not correct the problem. And I waited a couple months to write a review to see if they would correct it. Silly Senegal fits fine in this cage, he likes to hang out on the play top.  I added manzanita perches so my bird\u2019s feet get some exercise and a sand perch for his nails.  This is my second cage from this company and this one has a better powder coat finish, easier to clean.  Should last a long time, I think. I took advice of other reviews to invest a little extra money for my birdcage. I cannot be happier with this cage for my single cockatiel.  There is plenty of room for toys, bath, etc. She loves the above cage play area. The cage is sturdy, mobile and thoughtfully made. I place my birdcage in different areas of the house with ease for cleaning and activity. It's easy to clean and the side panels catch a lot of debris.  I would buy it again. I purchased the 18 x 18 size, but would get the next size up for two cockatiels. Great buy! Received the item in damaged condition. Noticed after I put it together. Not the best quality. Great color, fits any interior, can put up to 3 cockatiels I believe, I have one for now, but I defiantly believe he can have another two friends easily, easy to clean. Only upsetting thing is it came with a bottle of color to cover future damage and it was broken and leaked all over the bowls and instructions, it was hard to read it, and even harder to clean the bowls from it. Product was okay assembling, did it by myself . Although the cage is beautiful. The only problem I had was the big piece where it\u2019s supposed to catch food is poorly put together. Had a very hard time making the 4 pieces connect and when I did it looked horrible so I just left it off. Yes I did read the prints, I am a bearing inspector at my job so I read prints very carefully.. overall I recommend the cage. Did notice when I opened the package the metal was hot so maybe it bent and that\u2019s what gave me trouble. Fabulous!  Easy to put together.  Took me about an hour by myself.  Bought it in red and it is beautiful.  Looks great with my decor and have gotten lots of compliments on it from visitors.  Our cockatiel loves the space and large feeder bowls.  Well made and easy to clean.  Love the seed catchers that keep my house much cleaner than old cage.  Love the rollers so can move it anywhere, even on my travertine tiles. Both me and my Quaker approve of this cage. I removed a star because of a few chips in paint, but there were many noticable dents and bent parts on this product, even a bent leg on the stand which makes the cage unlevel and I can't bend it into place...  but his toes don't get stuck anywhere (which is why I replaced his other prevue bird cage of a different style) it seems very safe, all doors lock and I am overall pleased with it. Boxed ok, instructions were fine, only minor bends in the metal when it arrived. ", "As other reviewers have said, this cage comes with limited directions and takes a long time to figure out and put together (about two hours). We didn't run into any bent pieces and any paint chipping was easily fixed with the touch up paint that was included. Although there was a flaw on the ladder of the play top. Its hard to describe and if you order this, you will understand what I'm talking about better. The ladder on the play top is two pieces, each attaches to the metal piece with the perch by two screws on each side, then the ladder comes down to attach to the cage on each side by one screw. Well one side the ladder had two screw holes instead of one where it attaches, so we ended up just screwing one hole into the cage. So it's a tad crooked, but isn't noticeable unless looked for. This is a second large cage for our African Grey parrot. He's really not good at having new things (toys, cages, etc.) so he's just now starting to like being in the living room in the new cage. Cage was nice quality; we ordered for our cinnamon cockatiel. We put it together easily but realized afterwards that it's pretty low to the ground and we have two greyhounds and a cat that would be eye level with our bird so it's not acceptable, unfortunately we have to return. If it had taller legs or if the cage portion was higher it would be perfect. Just after writing my review, I looked up and noticed sitting on the couch in it's protective wrapping were the seed guards we forgot to put back in the box when we returned it yesterday. Can someone let us know how to get the seed guards back to you (amazon). Thanks!! Sturdy well made and easy to assemble. This is the smallest cage fit for only a single cockatiel. Not much room to really flap wings. Two birds would probably be miserable unless they small maybe a few budgies could live happily in here but u would have to buy smaller (narrower?) perches. I love the trays and the play area on top. My bird spends most of her day outside the cage but she seems to be very comfortable inside. VERY quick and easy to put together! I'm a small, petite 26 year old girl and I was able to put it together myself! These are amazing cages. These cages will last a very long time. I did order at Christmas time amd the shipping company used a couple of the boxes for kicking practice or something. Both Prevue AND Amazon were amazing with customer service. i purchased this cage for my green cheek conure, it's perfect, it's nice and long for her her to climb around in, which she loves, and the play top is where she hangs out supervised. when i received it i couldn't wait till the evening for help in putting it together, so i did it all on my own, very easy. i think it's an excellent cage and the pewter color is very pretty. This bird cage far exceeds my expectations. I have been searching for the perfect beautiful spacious cage for my Green Cheek Pinnapple Conure and we couldn't be more pleased. We purchased the medium size and it's perfect. It's super easy to clean and includes an extra safety latch for the door. Love the play area on top. Looks beautiful in the house. Very very pleased! No complaints! Toys are no problem to hang! Easy to put together. My sun conure likes his new cage. The only down side is that there are no small doors like a smaller traditional cage where you can add a bird bath on the outside of the cage. And the bird can enter/exit the bath without the need to exit the cage. I recently bought the Prevue \"Penthouse\" which is Prevue's model # 3153 cage. It was shipped in two very large cartons and there was a delay of a few days between their delivery. That said, I have no other complaints with this cage - It is well built, heavy duty, has a nice finish (I chose the Sage color) and my Congo African Grey parrot LOVES it. It is situated in my living room and I can happily report that it looks quite attractive there. My bird inspected it very carefully - being the sort of bird who inspects EVERYthing carefully, and after he had made his full rounds and peered at every joint and corner, rewarded me with many songs and bird call imitations to let me know I had done a good thing by giving him this wonderful new \"bedroom\". ", "We have two of these and both work out very well.  There is some simple assembly required.  The base helps keep those fly away seed casings off the floor.  The food and water bowls are easy to access, use, and clean.  The doors all function properly.  The stand and bowls on top are great for those who let their birds out to fly.  Cleaning is simple and fast.  The cage is sturdy.  For an improvement, it would be nice if all four wall panels had parallel bars (two side have parallel bars and the other two have vertical bars).  The birds seem to prefer the parallel bars for climbing. We loved the design and the fact that it's wrought iron, but their were some problems with installing it. There was a small ball of metal (that wasn't supposed to be there) that prevented a male part from connecting to a female part. Another section there was a design issue that prevented the connection. One star off because we weren't able to install item. One star off because we had to return it. Why not give it a one star? Because this item (if assembled) would look great in your house! It's a little on the small side. Not big enough to put in the recommended 7 toys a bird needs. My cockatiel has more room! I do feel that the seed catchers don't really do anything. My cockatiel loves to throw her pellets and it doesn't do much to catch seeds when she's eating. Also, it takes up a lot of space with the catchers on. But overall a great cage if you have multiple birds! An excellent product that has been thoughtfully designed and our Indian Ring Neck is very happy with it. Construction is good with only one small flaw, a main door hinge that was welded on slightly crooked but still functions fine with minor binding. I don't expect it to cause long term issues.  The cage is a great value and a must have for medium sized (and up) birds. It hold our two conures comfortably. I wish it came with more sticks or accessories. I have made things to hang on top and in their cage. Maybe more perch sticks other than the 2 ( one for top and one for inside). The doors that swing to put food and water makes daily maintance simple. It helps me not having to stick my hand in the cage because my 2 year old is a biter. The wheels make it easy to move so I can sweep under it. The guard and tray make picking up seedlings a breeze. Just the right cage to start off with my birdies. We have 2 cockatiels they love this unit. We bought the larger version of this unit (or very similar to this unit) first. The other unit was so large it wouldn't fit through standard sized door ways. This unit is great - easily moves through the house. We stuck with the other unit for nearly a year. I recently removed the tray around the base of the cage, as it didn\u2019t do a great job of containing the mess. My birds love the sky deck but the interior dimensions are not conducive to flying up or down inside the cage. In my opinion, a better design would be to have more width & less height. This cage would be pretty nice, if I didn't have to get creative trying to assemble the darn seed guard/perches! Most of the cage is great and I love the color, but the seed guard arrived *so bent* that it is completely unusable. The angles just don't match up, even if you carefully follow the instructions (which are not very helpful). Additionally, I had to sand down the ends of the top perch to make it usable with this cage, since it was a full inch too long. I usually don\u2019t write reviews, but I feel I need to on this product. It was shipped and received when they said (I got this in 2 days). The packing was great. It is in excellent condition. It was also easy to put together. My 13 year old daughter and I put it together while my husband was still at work. Very nice cage. Thank you. I am looking to replace a cage for my cockatoo. This one looks great and the reviews are good. But twice I have received damaged cages and have had to send them back. The last time a cage was delivered it was the same box with a damaged cage I had sent back. Not sure what I am going to do now. ", "I bought this cage as an upgrade for my moustache parakeet, and he LOVES it! He warmed up to it very quickly and it looks really nice in my living room. My bird loves to climb around the bars that hold the perch up at the top! Nice well made cage, I was worried after ordering it that the bars may be too wide apart for a Lovebird, But it works fine. Purchased this and it arrived today.  Packaged appeared to be sturdy however I found some pieces inside had been bent.  It was ok though as I was able to bend them back and were fine.  Hubby ended up working late so I put this together myself (sort of).  I am unable to get the u part together for the top play area so hubby can tackle that. The only problem with this cage is that the initial smell from the packaging? and/or paint on the cage? was extremely bad.  We had to air it out on our patio overnight. Even though the instruction sheet requires a magnifying glass, this birdcage gets five stars. It went together without a problem. Our Jenday Conure loves it. It's easy to clean and very attractive. Well designed with birds in mind. This is a small cage, and isn't for large parrots, but if you have a small bird, this is a wonderful cage. It assembles easily, has an easy access top play area, and is very secure. The front latch uses a push button to open, and there is a 2nd backup lock installed above the front door which must be slid up. It's virtually escape proof. The casters are large ball shaped, and roll easily. This is very stable going from room to room. The splatter catch is higher than usual (it's about 6\" above the bottom), but works very well. The design is well thought out both for bird and owner. Read the reviews and had NONE of the problems others reported. Took me 45 mins to put together minus the seed catcher. I am a middle aged woman and didn't need any assistance. My Goffin cockatoo loves it. After a research, I bought Prevue Pet Products cage for my Cockatiel in Chalk white MODEL N 3152. It is very nice pet home-cage, here is why: Cage is very solid and well built.  I ended up selling this cage 3 months after I purchased it because I don't like the how tall it is.  My tiel was clipped before he learned how to fly and when he'd fall he'd end up breaking some tail feathers.  Height is not as important as length when it comes to bird cages and yet most manufactures make tall rather than long cages.  For around the same price I'd recommend the prevue F070 divided cage, you can remove the divider and have one very large cage for a small to medium bird.  While I think this is a well made, great quality cage, I can't recommend it due to its odd dimensions. it comes in pieces that you have to assemble (duh), but it's not hard to put together.  A single person can do it, although two would make it a lot easier.  My problem w/a shipped cage is that the seed guards are usually always pretty beat up.  & in the case w/this cage, one of the places for a screw was messed up (couldn't get the screw in - the screw seemed fine though).  I don't know how to fix it, & shipping the defective part back & waiting for a replacement would have taken forever.  I just made do. ", "Was easy to put together but im very handy. I looked at all the negitive reviews before I bought this an it seemed like cages would show up damaged from delivery. I took a chance an mind was not damage easy to put together an my yellow nape amazon loves it. Bought the 2nd to large one. I could have done with the smaller one because the cage is quite large. Think the smaller one would have been enough cage and space for my parrot. He seems to like it. It came in what looked like a nice safe package but it was uneven and took a very long time to assemble. The top did not fit correctly, and the seed trays were damaged. The screws would not even remotely thread for the seed trays. I managed to bend the top part's final peg to make it fit. So all in all I have a somewhat assembled bird cage for my 3 month old bird. Very unhappy with this purchase. Really a good buy, the product was free from defects other than a tiny dent that isn't visible and doesn't affect functionality of the product. Thank goodness for Prime because the box is a little heavy, would hate to have lugged this thing from a store. It was easy to put together and very roomy for my conure. The idea of this cage was just what we wanted and would have been perfect if the holes lined up, the crews fit the holes and if everything thing wasn\u2019t bent all to hell. We were very disappointed in this cage. This was a birthday present for my daughter. We didn\u2019t open it and put it together till now so it\u2019s too late to return. Just what I was looking for. I came home and  my husband had already assembled it, he said it was easy. Looks good, good size for my caique. I wanted him to have more space without taking over my living room. I am thinking I might take the seed guard back off though, so it will sit flush on the wall. The last cage he figured out how to open, even with clips on it, this one he cant get out. He enjoys his house a lot more now though that it is bigger and filled with things to do to The only thing I wish it had was a spot to hang toys on the play area. And the lock on the door was a bit tweeked, but works perfectly. Easy to assemble, I wasn't sure which size to get but the 18x18 was perfect for my Senegal parrot. The play area ontop is great and very secure. The food and water bowls are a a great size, and are easy to take out and clean. Overall I am very impressed with the quality of this cage and the price. It comfortably keeps my Senegal parrot. The 18x18 is appropriate for 1 parrot, in the senegal/cocketeil/meyers parrot size range. Easily would hold 2 small parrots with room to spare. If you have an African grey or a parrot comparible in size I would get the next size cage up. I hesitated to buy the cage because of the feedback about bad shipping., i.e.,  damaged parts.  Returning something as heavy duty as this cage would have been awful.  I believe the company took the feedback seriously.  The box came with reinforcements on every corner of the box.  Also everything was zipped tied tightly so nothing moved around.  So there was no damage.  Instructions are basically a bunch of pictures, with very little description, but the setup wasn't too bad.  The best news is that my Cockatiel is very happy.  He's 22 so I was afraid he wouldn't.  You'll need to by extra 18\" perches because the cage only has one. Very nice cage. Package came with everything, nothing damaged, and even though it says it might take two people to assemble, I was able to assemble it with no problems myself. It took a couple of tries to get my bird to go into it (since it was new), but since getting her into it she seems at home. The whole thing can be assembled with a single allen wrench (included) and comes with a bottle of touch up paint and brush in case of any scratches during shipping. I didn't have any at all. The wires were all straight, everything fit perfectly. I highly recommend this cage. The color (I chose a brown color to match my apartment) is just a little bit darker than in the photos, but that makes it even better for me. It is a pretty good value. This is an attractive cage. I am always leery of foreign made products because of lack of hazardous materials. So, a bit paranoid about the paint/finish of the cage, I say this because it came with touch up paint and a brush.  Casters aren't the best, seed catcher is OK. Perches and ladder are minimal quality. With that, I have updated the perches, and covered the ladder with material for climbing comfort. The food and water bowl access and placement is extremely awkward. You may want to upgrade these although I haven't yet. Again, good value, attractive and bird transitioned well to it. ", "I got this for my parrot about a year and a half ago and it has been wonderful! It\u2019s nice and big so she has lots of space to play in. The side doors for food and water are great too! I found it really easy to clean with the two removable trays and the removable bottom. Olive (my parrot) loves it and so do I! I purchased this cage to match one I already had and this was perfect. It\u2019s as described, sturdy and looks very nice set up. My green cheek conure loves this cage. I love this cage for our pet conure Bibi. It took her some time being in it as she was not used to this type of cage when we got her. She loves to hang around the gym area. She only really spends time in it at night because we leave her out most of the day. It's a great quality cage,  nice, and for the most part easy to assemble. A great cage that is sturdy and easy to put together and I love the seed catcher beyond words. I gave a 4 star because the top part did not fit very well. The holes for the screws did not align (I think the metal may be warped somehow) and I ended up leaving one screw out and using a zip tie instead. It works fine for now. We have been living with our Parrot for over 4o years. It was time to downsize her cage without creating harm.  We are Seniors now, we just could not take care of the cage she was in anymore the way we like. My Amazon seems to have adjusted well to his new home.  I like the bird proof features with the little catch that prevents the door from closing all the way, if desired.  The seed cups are well designed and the bird cannot tip them like he used to do in his old cage.The top platform is great, since it can be lined with paper and gives him an alternative place to keep an eye on everything.His favorite hangout is the top of the opened cage door though. The cage arrived in good condition with very good packaging. The package is heavy and a little awkward to get in the front door.  I did need help from my son to assemble the sides, since it takes more than one person to put it together. The directions were adequate to figure out the assembly, and it took less than an hour to put it together.The coco brown color is really a softer light brown/copper shade. The picture color was accurate. Decent cage good size for the money. The box came smelling strongly of insecticide was nervous to even put a bird in there but realized the smell was on the outside of the box and not on the cage parts themselves. Bowls are decent so far just can't find the same size replacements for the brackets. A few paint chipped spots but they give you a small touch up paint bottle. For the price it was a good deal. I paid over $250 for my first one at a bird store. This one is has a bigger cage area and $100 less. Great quality and easy to put together. Just wish the legs were a bit longer like my other cage cause this one sits kinda low. But overall, a great cage. I'm not quite sure why everyone has had such a hard time putting the cage together, my fianc\u00e9 and I put the cage together in under twenty minutes for our Green Cheek Conure and hardly looked at the directions. Came with no damage despite to fact that the box had multipe baseball size holes from transit! Fit together wonderfully and all of the pieces lined up. We had no trouble with bolts being to short or to long. All together I was a little skeptical to order this cage because of all the reviews, a little common sense and this cage is a breeze to assemble. (We did two day shipping so this was a rushed order) there is an odor from the oil they use to coat the wheels with but if you air it out prior to placing your bird in it you'll be fine. I am very happy with my purchase and would order it again in the future, as well as recommend it to anyone! I bought two of these cages and assembled both over the weekend. This cage is not horrible, but I would not buy it again. If returning them was not such a hassle (they are already assembled), I would have returned them. ", "This is hands down the BEST bird cage we have ever purchased.  The ease of changing the water and adding food ( it swings out on the side of the cage) is brilliant!!  the metal is a nice heavy gage and easy to wipe and keep clean. Our bird enjoys his large cage and like his play area on top.  I also like that they supply you 4 metal containers so you have food and water inside the cage and food and water on their little play area on top.  the wheels make it easy to move around the room if you want to change it up for your feathered friend. lastly, the metal covering around the cage at the bottom is a game changer in keeping the floor clean.  Well worth the money, our cockatiel loves it. This cage is very sturdy, however it took three people, vice grips and a hammer to get the pieces to line up to the holes. Also the small piece in the last photo that is to prevent the tray from going forward does not latch in place. I got this cage for my sun conure. He loves it I love it, very well-made easy to put together.  One panel was damaged needed to be replaced. The lady at preview was very helpful did not require me to send a copy of invoice etc. because I only have an iPhone no computer or printer. I prefer to buy only preview Hendrix birdcages I have two And the quality can\u2019t be beat. The, Prevue Hendryx 3151C  Wrought Iron Select Bird Cage, is an aviary for the pair of birds I have.  I purchased it in their Chalk White color which blends in well with the surroundings.  The birds have been happy, not so with a regular-sized bird cage even though they were out of the smaller one more than they were in (I felt sorry for them not being able to stretch their wings)  With the aviary, I let them out once a day but then they return to it after a couple hours of flitting about. Pain in the arse to put together, but I did it alone so not that bad... took me maybe just under, if not, an hour to do. Read the instructions, as you'll think you are missing pieces and can easily slide the doors in backwards. Otherwise, a great product for the price point! This cage was fairly easy to build by myself but at some point an extra pair of hands is needed. The cage is gorgeous and sturdy and just CLEARLY good quality. The price was worth the product and I am SOLD on this brand. 1 / Awesome price:  Found almost identical cage(s) costing upwards of $125.00 more. I should have looked at the dimensions, but it is a large cage and my conure has enough room for her and plenty of toys. The dishes are big enough so she loves to bathe in the water. She also loves the top and it is roomy enough for her. I love the ease of cleaning the catch trays. The cage is made of metal so perfect for a parrot who likes to chew on everything. If I decide on a bigger cage I will go with this brand. My 2 Green Cheek Conures love the cage they spend most of their time on top playing or looking outside and go inside the cage to sleep on their own. The only complicated thing to put together was the seed guards because they were bent had to fix. Total time to assemble 30 minutes. Some of the holes were not all the way drilled either so had to get a drill but for the price a quality of cage. Ease of cleaning. It's easy to wheel outside so my birds get some sunshine.Same cage at Petmart I almost bought $300. I like I could feed the birds in the play area also I bought the 18x18  This cage was easy to assemble, the wire used on this cage is heavy-duty. Everything about this cage is great, except for the welds, they over grinded all the welds. ", "This is the 4th cage I have bought  All my birds are happy and have more room We bought this for our Conjure Jengo and he loves it! It's large enough for him to play and move around, yet it's safe enough so that he can't bite anyone when he's being a bad boy! He loves loves loves playing on the top and I love that the sides catch all of his poopies! It rolls around, so if I need to move him I can and it looks sooo cool! Everyones like WOW...cool cage! The cage is very high quality,  but we were disappointed in how it was packaged and shipped.  It came in 2 boxes strapped together,  which was awkward and dropped multiple times by UPS.  It is too heavy for any driver to carry.  It should have been shipped in two to three separate packages.  It was bent and scratched.  We were able to repair,  but very disappointed about how it arrived. Very nice size, more than big enough for my quaker. He cannot get out, due to very smart locking mechanisms, and food and water is easily reached from the side. Easy to clean, just roll it outside, remove paper liner and trays and hose off. Came with a small brush and bottle of paint for touch ups, which it did need in 2 places when it arrived. Was very difficult to assemble, need at least 4 hands Some of the parts don't fit together, and we had to use a hammer to shape and force certain parts to link together. Otherwise, decent cage, slightly expensive since it was a little bit smaller than imagined. Should buy if you're on a budget and looking for a decent cage. Color and finish is nice, as pictured. We had to bend the ladder at the top too, otherwise it wouldn't fit into all of the holes. I bought this cage for our Green Cheek Conure. So far, this cage has treated us well. A lot of reviews said that the paint chipped while putting it together, but we were careful and didnt see any chipping (knock on wood). Very affordable cage with useful features. Would recommend! Item arrived with all but two of the tie wraps busted. A number of items were bent but most could be repaired easily. The \"skirts\" were all bent but rather than fool with them I left them off...I mean, the seed is on these or the plastic office mat we placed below the cage so what's the diff. The price of $230 is great for a cage of this size particularly with free shipping. Assembly is straight forward. Do not overly tighten the lower panels until the side panels are popped in. Really a slick design. The whole main cage is held together with about 8 screws! The screw count in the instruction inventory is wrong and I actually had extras. Be careful which way those side panels face and which is the top (instructions are little help here). Rollers make cage movement really easy. Only two perches meant a couple hours in the wood shop making 8 more. From unpacking to completed assembly and clean-up took about two hours with just me on the job. Awesome, pleasant color should go with about any interior decor. The drawer size is perfect for dropping in a \"thrifty nickel\" newspaper sheet. Latches that hold food/water cups are worthless and irritating. Cups hang off level. Main door latch and back-up safety tab is a great design (our parrot is quite adept at opening cage doors....this time he will fail!). An impressive cage that would have netted a 5 star if so many items were not bent or dented. Purchased this in pewter, which looks white-gray in person. Feels sturdy and substantial. The cage did have some chips but it is near impossible not to with painted wrought iron. (And it does come with a little bottle of touch-up paint.) I love this cage! It was fairly easy to assemble, just make sure to carefully read the directions. I was afraid it wouldn't be big enough for my Quaker parrot but it really does have a lot of space! I also really like the play area at top. Overall it is just what I was looking for and I am completely satisfied. I only received parts of the cage.  The box was labeled box 2 of 2.  There was no box 1 of 2!  I\u2019m bummed because it looked great and had a great price.  Amazon gave me the option to order again or return, and I returned it because of timing reasons.  What I did receive looked great and good quality. ", "This cage was a great value for the price! I purchased this item a little hesitant after seeing some reviews stating the cage arrived in poor condition, but I seemed to have lucked out: Everything arrived looking brand-new, and while the side cage pieces were slightly warped, they straightened out as soon as I put the cage together. Will definitely be buying again! We have this cage in white for a few months and recently purchased  a larger brown one.  They are a beautiful addition to our living room.  We found the directions easy to follow and had them up is a short time.  At the start it was different to have the bars horizontal on two sides and vertical on the other.  However, it did not take long for our cockatiel to learn how much fun it is to slide down the vertical bars.  The doors to get to the food are great and the seed guards and finish make them easy to clean.  We did have a problem with the brown cage but the company took care of it easily, quickly,and  above our expectations.  If we ever get another bird, we will be sure to purchase another of these. I had been meaning to get a new cage for a while and this one was one of the cheapest. It arrived in perfect condition and really was not that difficult to set up, it took maybe 45 minutes. I included a picture of the cage directly after setup (before it is stuffed with bird toys). I didn\u2019t put the seed catchers on. For my conure I feel it is the perfect size. If you have a bird larger than a green cheek conure I would recommend maybe getting the next size up. Good cage. Decided not to use the guard around bottom. Husband had no problem putting it together. Bought a used like new cage. It was good enough BUT hated getting suckered on the cost...especially used. No one answers when you call Prevue, there is no where on Amazon to report the problem, you are directed to a link and you fill in your name.  I can't keep a bird in this broken cage that cost me over $400! I love this cage and so does my bird!! My local pet store wanted double the price for this exact model.. I\u2019ve had it for almost a year now and it\u2019s still perfect! Very very sturdy and I love that it has wheels Wasn't the easiest to assemble the terrible directions, but got together in about 45 minutes. Two of the pieces that go in the bottom of the legs to attach wheels were broken. Contacted customer service several days ago and they still have not responded. Conure loves it!  A few pieces were slightly bent from shipping, but we were able to bend them back into place.  Color is exactly as pictured. Quality is good and was easy to assemble. This is a perfect size cage for a small parrot. I was very happy with the bird cage. I wanted the old model with the arched ladder as pictured and got it (wasn't expecting it). Most companies selling Prevue cages are using the old stock photos shown with the cool arched ladder but are fulfilling orders with the lame and ugly new single straight front ladder design. The arched ladder design has been discontinued by Prevue. I imagine as soon as old stock is depleted Amazon will begin shipping the new model without updating images. This probably does not matter to most people but i have several of the same cage and wanted them all to match. I love this cage, and so does my bird.  It was easier to put together than I thought it would be.  It's sturdy and has some nice features like the doors for food and water access and wheels, so I can move it around easily.  It also comes with a little bottle of paint and a brush,  but I didn't see any chipping and there were no missing parts. ", "Great cage. I have two of these. Great value for the money. Don\u2019t buy the cheaper versions even though they look similar. They are not. The quality on this one is the best. Took about 30 mins to assemble. This is the perfect cage for a quaker parrot. I would also use this for a cockatiel size bird. I would not put two birds in this size cage. I love the food and water bowl access from the outside of the cage. My guy does not like my going in his house. The skirt does collect most of the mess. If the bird is on the door and its open at a 90 degree angle the poop will hit the floor. It is easy to clean and maintain. Came with a piece of iron missing from the bottom that I just used a zip tie to connect. A little aggravated about that, but I wanted to get my bird moved over instead of getting this shipped back. The box is heavy. A little smaller than I thought it would be, but I should have looked at the dimensions better. Cage is sturdy, and I don't have to worry about my cats getting at my conure, or better my conure getting at the cats. He seems to really like it. Put it together by myself. Went up fine. Cage is heavy duty and easy to put together. All items came, no issues with delivery, same as the one sold in local pet stores and much cheaper. Bars do not bed easily and is a great size for my conure, and Lory. (I have 2 seperate Cages) I got the cage fairly quickly, but the cage came damaged and bent in multiple places. The edges were terribly welded and shaped, a lot of the screws wouldn't even fit in and the guards along the sides of the cage came broken so they barely fit on. I reiterate, it came broken in multiple places, and was nearly impossible to put together because of that. Spend a little extra cash and get something that was built like it was meant to function. Difficult to put together, didn't come with all of the parts, the seed catching tray doesn't fit onto the cage properly, and my Timneh African Grey almost lost a toe on the top play area. There are gaps in the metal where the wood perch attaches on the top play area. My TAG got his toenail caught and his foot thoroughly twisted before we could get him lose. On top of all of this, the cage is made in CHINA. I couldn't tell that until the box arrived. DON\"T BUY. This is a great cage. Comes with a play area, seed guard and excellent door latches. The bowls they bring for food and water are not optimal of you have a very active mischievous bird like mine. It's very spacious so there is room for toys, ladders and different perches. The only concern I had putting it together was the cage felt slightly off center so every time something has to be inserted it was a little problematic I'm not sure if the cage was like this or if it got like that from shipment. Overall its a good cage for it's value. I love this cage, but some of the bars were bent, paint was rubbed off, and both pans were bent. Sturdy/stable, roomy, clean, and low maintenance if you can keep up with it.. Cleaning out the cracks is a bit of a pain, I get it out of one crack and it just seems to slip into another. I have a Quaker (the renowned escape artists) who hasn't broken out yet. Though I did find one edge slip out. It only came with half of the instructions but my dad helped me figure it out and put it together. You definitely need more than one person to put it together. It looks just like the photo. Arrived packaged well and undamaged . Clear instructions and all pieces including Allen wrench . My teen son and I started the process of construction . It could be done alone but was very easy with two . We set up the first stage then I had to leave to take younger son to soccer . We were back in and hour and my son had put it all together ! Just fantastic . Very sturdy very well made very attractive ! Lots of room inside and great play deck on top ! Our conure loves it . Very happy ! ", "Product is sort of a pain to put together and several pieces were bent. A few screws were stripped but overall it\u2019s a good product. I bought it for my two parakeets and they love the space. I love how the cage is designed to catch seeds so they don\u2019t go all over the floor. The birds live the top play area too. It looks nice, I would buy it again. I'm very pleased with this cage and so is my Yellow Sided Green Cheek Conure. The Amazon price is very impressive and especially when compared to the well known chain @ $354.99 and close to 3xs when compared to our local privately owned pet store. I opened the package as soon as it arrived (1-day shipping @ $3.99 with prime) and immediately put it together which took approximately 20 min.  I prepared myself for major problems after reading some of the reviews, but assembly was a breeze. Instructions were both easy to read and easy to follow, until I got to the cagetop playstand & corner seed guards. It is at this point that you may need to exercise a bit more patience and rely on a little intuition (use the picture as a guide). Once the cage is fully assembled it is beautiful and works very well to my surprise. I half way expected this cage to be inferior to the ones that we've seen in stores, but the inexpensive price does not mean that its cheaper in quality and that was a very nice bonus. Got a great deal on this cage, it's a little expensive but we'll worth it. The cage is huge and my parrot loves it. The playground on top is an added bonus. You can buy a cheaper cage but why risk it? The product shipped with the box in perfect condition, but the parts inside were bent and I had to order a new piece before I could assemble it. The part I received as a replacement was the wrong color, but I didn't want to wait another 5+ days for the correct part to order. The cage was also fairly hard to assemble due to the bent parts. I had an exceptionally hard time assembling the skirting around the cage. I had to bend parts back to get it to fit together and even still it doesn't sit around the cage quite right. Overall it works, but the hard time I had with broken parts and assembly will make me choose a different product in the future. Was really surprised on how fast I received this cage. Packing was very good, only minor scratches. Comes with small bottle of paint and brush for touch ups. Went together very easily. Perfect size for a small parrot. Great value for the price. My 3 month old 'tiel surprised me by loving and exploring it immediately.  He is so happy!  This cage is incredibly sturdy and was packed so well and so carefully...well, I've never ever seen something packed so well.  Not difficult to.put together, just follow directions.  So happy I got it.  Mine is in pewter color, so glad I decided on this instead of black or white or sage. Although box was pretty torn up on delivery, everything was there and in good condition inside. Easy to put together, was pleased to find touch up paint in case it had any scratches. which it didn't. Definitely recommend Dimensions are a bit misleading online I thought, measurements include the playpen to the top from the bottom so consider this when deciding your size. I seen this exact cage in a pet store for $249.00 and saved $125.00 thru Amazon.  Great deal!  It is perfect for our Meyers parrot Casey, her old cage was from 1999 and was due for a new one so I decided to downsize.  It was pretty easy to put together and will go up in a snap with a second person.  My grand daughter assisted me and she read directions and directed the whole process.  Sturdy cage and easy to clean. I added stone perches and some toys, Casey adjusted well! Very well packaged, arrived on time, but the instructions could have been better. My son and I ordered this while out of town so it would be at the house when we returned. It was shipped and arrived on time; however, it was the wrong color.  Unfortunately, my son's dad had put it together (not knowing it was the wrong color) by the time we arrived home so we are stuck with a weird green cage and not the black cage ordered. ", "Came on time as described. You can't beat the convenience of having things delivered to your door wishing 2 days. I was able to have the cage set up and ready for my Goffins cockatoo. This cage is the perfect size for him. He's had larger cages before and prefers a cage of this size. Always a good isles to give your bird the biggest cage you can afford and space will allow. Very easy to assemble. I have a larger version of basically the same cage from a different manufacturer and this was much easier to assemble. The cage itself is a good size (I purchased mine for a CAG).  The directions for putting the cage together are horrendous, and lack any detail at all, it's mostly a \"lets see if this is going to work, ooops, ok, lets try it this way). My cage arrived on time, but when I finally got around to putting it together, I noticed that the sides were bent, the seed skirt had bent places, and there were several areas that had paint chipped off. When the cage arrived the bottle of touch up paint had leaked on one of the food bowls. The odor was very strong so I didn't feel comfortable having the bowl near my bird. I contacted the manufacturer and they replaced the bowl that had paint on it and also sent a new bottle of touch up paint. This is the most awesome birdcage ever!  It is very well made and has plenty of room for my green cheek conure.  Rio spends a lot of time in her cage due to her excessive biting so I wanted something large in case she had to stay in it 24/7.  She sleeps in it in the kitchen at night and then we wheel her into the living room during the day so she can watch TV and the dog. I received this today and almost left it for my husband to put together, but my curiosity got the best of me. I unpacked it and with all the pieces scattered on my living room, I wondered, \"what in the heck did I get myself into?\" to my surprise (and my husband's) I put this cage together by myself, in a matter of about 40 minutes. it's surprisingly simple and self explanatory. idk what all the fuss was about with unclear instructions, etc... if I can do it, anybody can! the only con I have is the U bar on the top playground part that holds the food and water bowls and the perch did not fit together well and when screwed down, was lopsided. being a perfectionist, my husband did some bending and twisting of the U bar and straightened it out for me. overall, simple to put together, nice size for small to possibly medium bird. i will be picking my indian ringneck up in a couple of days so i can't give an opionion of how well it fits my bird until i bring him home. I'm writing a review a couple years later. I got it for my green cheek conure and he still loves it. Even the cockatiels love his cage. missing half of the cage! only box 1 of 2 arrived. and box was damaged so bent and missing paint in places. the top, bottom, nut and bolts as well as bowls perch (accessories) missing! pretty frustrated by this! We have both the smaller white cage and recently purchased brown one.  They are a beautiful addition to our living room.  We found the directions easy to follow and had them up is a short time.  At the start it was different to have the bars horizontal on two sides and vertical on the other.  However, it did not take long for our cockatiel to learn how much fun it is to slide down the vertical bars.  The doors to get to the food are great and the seed guards and finish make them easy to clean.  We did have a problem with the brown cage but the company took care of it easily, quickly,and  above our expectations.  If we ever get another bird, we will be sure to purchase another of these. This cage went together very easily (though I have had other cages so I had an idea of how to assemble it).  I got it as a second cage for my Congo African Grey ... one where he could perch and eat when we are home. I don't think I'd recommend it as an ONLY cage for a CAG due to its smaller size, but it works great as a second cage that I can wheel outside onto the deck or from room to room in the house. ", "I bought the 18 x 18 x 57 size. It will be fine with one bird, but I should have bought the bigger cage for my Pineapple Conure. It was easy to put together, but some of the parts were somewhat bent, which didn\u2019t hinder putting it together. I had it put together in less than an hour with the help of another person. So I read all the bad reviews and though on no what did I buy! I was very happy one bar was bent alittle bent back no problem! Study! I got the 30 inch perfect for my African grey Timneh! This cage is perfect for my Matilda! She's very confortable in it, with plenty of room for all her stuff. Came in with a few minor bends, that's why the 4 stars intead of 5. Nothing the right tools, and a handy hubby, can't fix. ;) Nice cage. On the initial set-up, it's difficult to get toys in because there's not much access. I did not put on the seed catchers, even with round corners it hurts when bumping into it. I really like the cover over the door. If the latch comes open, the door stays closed. I really like this cage!! So much better than the last one I had for my bird- because of the design and it just looks so much nicer than a lot of white plastic like cages out there. The size is perfect for my Senegal parrot. The only reason I am taking one star off is because of the time it took for me to build it but I am not savvy in that area. If you are then you will love this cage. Really happy with my purchase though! Absolutely amazing!!! It was easy to put together took me about 30 mins which isn\u2019t bad being that I did it alone. The guards on the sides do work which was something I questioned when purchasing. My Blue Crown Conure is really enjoying this cage!!!  She looks like she is in a hotel now!!!  It is a very nice cage and the price is great.  Only complaint I may have is that in some places like the seed guard is bent some and one of the back bars, but not bad.  One thing I really like about it is that the poop comes off easily with the type of finish this cage has on it.  I also like the fact it has wheels to be able to move it and also love the playtop. I have had these cages before and love them--I am so pleased Amazon has them at this wonderful price.  They are well-designed for security and cleaning, the powder coating is bird-safe, and they are really easy to assemble.  I assembled it alone (senior woman) in 45 minutes without the shields which I don't use. Packing is great. I wouldn't buy anything else for conures or similar-sized birds. Excellent cage! Very happy with it. We received it much sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise. My son wanted this for his new cockatiel we will be bringing him in a couple days. The quality is great and the cage is so easy to build. My 13 yr ols son build it by himself. I highly recommend this cage. We love this cage for our Caique Parrot.  It's a great size for her to be active, & it has plenty of room for multiple toys and her cozy bedtime hut. ", "wrong colour was sent have no use for it look very dark Very nice cage for my conure. The grey is a pretty color. I bought the coco color before, both colors are lovely.  Fast shipping. As usual, Prevue has an awesome cage to suit any need.  I bought this for my quaker parrot, and he loves it as much as I do.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I definitely recommend Prevue's cages.  Some may think that this cage is a little small for a quaker, but she hardly spends any time inside of it.  Only night time, for sleeping, and for when I have to leave the house to run an errand.  The rest of the time, she's out on top, playing. The color is beautiful and we saved so much assembling ourselves instead of buying a cage from the pet store. The size and durability is just what we wanted and we can see this lasting for many years. It even came with a small bottle of touch up paint I will be keeping for later. Very happy with this purchase! Love this cage. Second one I purchased. Easy to assemble with the exception of one of the screws would not go in because it was not aligned properly but other than that no issues. I bought this cage for black headed caique it really takes two to put together but put that aside because it is a very high quality cage. It\u2019s thoughtfully made I saw this cage at Petsmart and thought about getting it. Then I found out that I could get it shipped from Amazon. I had it for a few days before deciding to put it together. I had read a previous review that gave it 4 starts minus 1 because the instructions on putting it together was not that great. I agree they were not the best instructions but, only took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I just finished putting it together and am impressed with the quality of the cage (I'm sorry HOME). I have it next to the old cage so Mango (The bird will be used to it). This is such a high quality cage.  We have a 30 yr old African grey and she loves this as one of her many houses.  It is small but she's only in there to eat and sleep.  She has other cages and play stations scattered around inside and out.  Yes, she's demanding\ud83d\ude03.  This cage is first class.  Extremely sturdy and very good looking.  It took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together.  Highly recommend. DO NOT OPEN the little STYROFOAM BOX enclosed with the tools!  It will EXPLODE PERMANENT PAINT STAINS all over your carpet!  There is no label on the box to let you know what is inside, so hopefully you read this review before you are stuck with blue stains all over your white carpet with no hopes of removal despite trying carpet cleaner and trick in the book.  It didn't help that the paint bottle inside the little box was already broken too, so opening the tape off the styrofoam just ruined any former enthusiasm for the product. easy to assemble, product as described. fair size for my conure although I would buy a bigger size but I can't complain. beautiful design it has everything that my sun conure needs. overall happy but I would advise if you have a sun conure buy the next bigger size thats all. this size its not bad ", "Solid cage, but came damaged.  Still able to use.  contacted manufacturer and they were quick to respond, but overall did not offer any workable solutions. The cage is a good size and arrived quickly. I was exceptionally pleased with the sturdiness of the cage in general. It was exactly what I needed and I was fortunate to find it at a great cost. It even comes with touch-up paint should it ever be needed. My Pineapple Conure is a king in this cage it is huge and he will thrive in it and the playtop, how fun too! Great cage! I purchased this cage for two cockatiels and have since added a 3rd 'tiel.  They all live happily in it.  I'm a petite single woman and was able to put it together just fine.  We haven't really used the play top much; maybe in time we will.  You definitely get what you see.  Also love the coco brown color!  Very pretty!  No regrets! Perfect home for our Conure. Easy to assemble and not too large. More perches are needed. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that the latch broke after about 2 weeks. However, Prevue support was great as a new latch assembly arrived after a week no questions asked. Good job. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a classy home for their conure without breaking the bank. We like the rollers and how sturdy the cage is.  We had to buy two extra perches. Love it, & so does my parrot. I\u2019ve had this cage for coming up on a year now and I can tell you it have been wonderful for my Quaker parrot. It\u2019s strong, sturdy and secure, and very high quality. Like the title says, I absolutely love love love this cage!  It\u02bbs a very sturdy cage.  It\u02bbs a very well built, great quality product.  For the price you really can\u02bbt go wrong.  I bought it for my cockatiel and he absolutely loves it!  I did find that the seed guard does take up a lot more space when trying to find a good place to set it up so I ended up taking them off.  Luckily, they were easy to remove.  A+ for making it easy! ", "I purchased this Prevue 3154 large parrot cage, and also a Prevue 5152 small parrot cage, both from Amazon itself. The manufacturer should be embarrassed by the lack of proper directions as to how to put this cage together.  Thankfully, if you go to YouTube and put in the model number there's a video of how to put it together.  Without the video, I wouldn't have been able to figure it out.  It's a nice cage once it's assembled, but there's no excuse for the bad directions that are included with it. has held up well and my african grey loves it This cage is really really well built. Easy to clean. And looks nice. I\u2019m glad I picked this one. And am very happy with it Arrived in great shape. Perfect color and blends into the room without taking it over. Perfect for sun conure. Had to return it due to a manufacturing (welding) defect. Once the production lot that ours was manufactured with is gone I would consider ordering this cage again as a satellite cage for our two cockatiels. Perfect and beautiful for my Bird, Delwyn.  She loves it and she has a lot of room to move around.  The shipping was fast even though I only did standard shipping. The color is a little darker in person than what you see on here but still very cool.  The instructions were odd but my family too from my hands and put it together.  I didn't even get to help because they were more excited about it than I was. Now Delwyn has all the room to be her birdy self. The cage was very poor quality. 1) welded bars that were poorly welded and looked very crooked, 2) paint not evenly coated and lots of drip marks, 3) food cover knobs where too long and I couldn't close the food door so I had to use a twist tie, 4) one of the wooden perches was missing, 5) in shipment the touch-up paint exploded all over the instructions and food bowls 5) paint so uneven, that I could see unpainted places, and seemed uncured in some spots. So easy to clean and perfect in every way for my cockatiels. You just have to be careful when assembling because the paint can chip if you\u2019re not careful. I researched a lot of cages before purchasing this for my African grey that I just adopted. I am very happy with the purchase. Great quality for the price. All the reviews I read we're correct. Instructions did not make sense and small dents on cage upon arrival. Regardless, this cage is exactly what I wanted. It was actually more than what I expected for the price and my bird Jack loves it. I definitely would recommend this cage. Just make sure you have a second person to assist with assembling. ", "I really love this cage and it was just the right size for my Blue Crown Conure, He is happy with it too! Sage Green is Beautiful! The shipment came in two boxes and was easy to open and put together. The only damage was the bottom tray is dented but usable. The rest was in excellent condition This bird cage is awesome! Great price for the size. It took my 14yr old (it's his bird and he purchased with his own money) about 30 min. to assemble it. It's very sturdy and easy to move around. Visitors always ask him how much he paid for it and they always tell him what a good deal he got! Highly recommend 5 Stars***** We got this for our cockatiel, it's a great cage, well made, perfectly thought through as far as doors and locks and food bowls, etc. Yep, as others have stated, the instructions are not the best but I was able to figure it out and get it assembled. Appears to be good quality materials and the finish looks good with no runs or chips. Good size cage at a great price. The only thing if I had to pick something would be the wheels, they could have been a little better but I'm happy with it! peices were bent, the holes on some of them still had the metal cut out where the machine did not get it so i had to pry them out with a screwdriver This birdcage has served my cockatiel extremely well!  He is usually a pretty messy eater and likes to toss the seeds around all over the floor, but with the seed guard, everything gets thrown back into the bottom of the cage. The items were very badly damaged, can't return as box was destroyed as well, the top welds were not only cracked but broken off, very poor craftsmanship, I have been looking for a used cage on Craig's list for a while and they were so expensive. I decided it was worth it to spend a little more to purchase a new one and have it delivered which was free with my Amazon Prime.I did not have to drive around and then figure out how to get a cage home. I love this cage and so does my Blue Front Amazon parrot Ringo!!! He is really happy and loves the play pen on top. It is well made,the perfect size and it looks great! I am glad I picked the Coco Brown. It is neutral and blends in with any decor.  I did not find it difficult to assemble by myself. The only thing I would recommend is to buy a stronger wood branch type perch for the inside. Ringo chewed up the soft wood perch that comes with the cage the first week! Prettiest cage out there. Easy to clean and plenty of space. Nice playtop. One cage panel came damaged and the Prevue Pet Products replaced the panel within 2 weeks. Great quality. Would buy again!!! ", "The cage seems heavy enough and well made in terms of the metalwork, which I like, however the packaging for shipping was done very poorly and caused damage to many parts of the cage.  The seed catchers and the slide out trays have dents in them.  The small panels are very BADLY chipped with a lot of paint coming off of them and it looks like more will continue to chip away.  There are also small scratches, right down to the bare metal, in the paint on other pieces.  Some of the pieces have edging that has gotten bent.  Touchup paint and a small paintbrush have been included in the box, but I don't trust it...I bought a cage with a powdercoated finish for a reason - so my bird won't be able to chip paint away and get poisoned from ingesting it and by being exposed to the metal beneath the paint!  Plus, if you paint your cage, the bird will be exposed to paint fumes unless you just happen to have a spare cage while the other cage dries and off-gases its toxic fumes in a separate area. this cage is perfect for my green-cheek conure and for my small apartment.  She seems so happy every time I put her away, or on top of the cage, and the lock plus door block is perfect for keeping her from pulling a little birdie Houdini. I also appreciate having a cage skirt to catch all her little scraps and to keep the cat from trying to climb the cage. Our birdie got her wing caught between the bars and who know what would have happened to her if we were not there to rescue her. This is not an appropriate cage for Cockatiels even though the description said it was. Average quality. Some holes didn't quite line up. Spots of tan something on my white cage. Seed guards too bent to install. I will probably be looking for a different cage in the near future. Nice size for our second home. May not be the best option for a medium size parrot permanently, unless the parrot gets out to utilize the \"play\" area atop the cage. Easy to clean, nice splash guard. I love this cage! It went to gether easily, it's got a good, sturdy construction and plenty of room for multiple perches for small to mid sized parrots. My Quaker is terrified of it, but I think once he adjusts, he will be very pleased. The double locking door and side access food and water ports are excellent additions as well. Overall a steal for the price. I'd been eying this same cage for three times the price at Petco! I love this cage! It arrived on time with no damage. The material is of high quality and the color is beautiful. I was able to put it together by myself in about an hour. I was able to fit more perches and toys creating great space for a bird to play. It even came with touch up paint. I will be purchasing this cage again when I need a larger one. Easy to assemble. Looks exactly like the picture. No chips or scratches although the packaging was beat up pretty good. Packaging it better would be smart but mine turned out fine. Great Product, easy to assemble. Blue Cheek Conuer loves it! Great item.  The product took a little longer to ship, probably because it came in 2 boxes and weighed over 100 pounds.  A piece was broken, and I had to have it welded.  Amazon did not have another to send in replacement, plus to return ship it would have been too much trouble.  The Prevue company would not send a replacement part as stated in the paperwork that was sent in the box, they wanted amazon to handle the defective part by sending the whole thing back. ", "The cage is well made and stylish.  It definitely needed two people to put it together but once we managed to bang our fingers a few times we finally realized the pain was worth it.  It took a few days for my bird to get used to her new home. It a nice sturdy cage, good size. Birds happy It was fairly easy to assemble, however, the perch that goes across the cage was missing.  I contacted customer service to get a replacement and they made it so difficult to get a replacement that I just gave up and went out and bought one.  I won\u2019t buy another product from them because their customer service sucks. Great cage for my \u2018tiel. She really enjoys being on top to stretch her wings. Easy to assemble and plenty of spots to hang toys, food. I used some of that \u201cstatic cling sports wrap\u201d to cover some of the surfaces she stands . This birdcage is the perfect size for my cocketiel. The instructions were simple for assembly (though I would recommend having a partner). The only downside I can find is that the only feeders the cage will fit are the ones that are provided with the cage. Otherwise, it is perfectly roomy and the playtop is a great addition. I didn't have any problems at all it was packed well and all pieces were there.  Went together easily and is working great for my bird! Wonderful purchase!!! This same cage is just under $400 at pet stores! You also get the bonus of free shipping with Amazon!!!! We have had our Africian Grey for about 25 yrs and she adjusted really well in her new surroundings. We asked each other why we didnt make this purchase a few years back!!!! A great purchase and highly recommend!!!!!! The seed catcher does not fit well. Attachment tabs need to be longer. Otherwise it is a nice cage for our 2 Lobe birds. I'm really impressed with this cage's build quality and design!  Prior to assembly, I washed everything down with a solution of vinegar and warm water (and dried with a towel).  The assembly went smooth and is designed (for the most part) for one person to assemble. Includes is an allen wrench to use with the stainless hardware (nice plus) but I did need another person hold the skirt panels while using a wrench (or needle nose pliers) to hold the nut as threaded the hex head screw into it.  The directions are simple and I found it necessary to reference the picture of the cage to confirm assembly (easy enough to figure out).  Overall it took me 90 minutes to wash, dry, assemble, decorate and introduce my cockatiel to the new cage. Received two cages within a few days. I'm waiting for my Senegal to be weaned. It took me approximately 30 minutes to put first one together. I read some of the reviews and one recommended watching on u tube illustrating the guy put it together which made it so easy to assemble without any instructions. My husband always put things together but wanted to see how I could accomplish it. It did take more time assembling the seed guard by myself but ended putting ends together then slipping the tabs in afterwards. The second cage I put together in less time and will eventually put in a Black Caique. Great for what I need it for. ", "This is a great cage for my sun conure. Easy to clean, easy to feed, and easy to get her out. She loves the perch on top too. It was missing one part when I got the package, but Prevue Pet had it to me in a few days. Great customer service. I actually have two of these cages. I\u2019m very upset because the cage came with many dents and was bent in multiple places. You don\u2019t realize it until you\u2019ve already unboxed it and there\u2019s no way to get it back into the box to return it so you just have to live with the dents. I feel I spent a good amount of money for it to be dented and bent. Nice cage. this is heavy enough for a parrot, or large bird. finish is great, cocoa color. Plenty of room for bird , perches, and toys. Sturdy!  The pans that go around the side are very nice I owned a cage a few years ago that cut you every time you walked by due to the sharp edges!  This cage has rounded them and they are smothe in joining together!  Very nice!  Only 1 downfall that is why  I didn't give it a 5 star is the base is a lot shorter then I expected.  So I you have to bend to clean the lower pan out (not so fun with a bad back.)  But all in all it is a great cage if you don't mind the low rider effect!  LOL I love this cage, it was perfect for my son's sun conure . Was mostly easy to put together, and I'm not good with building anything . Had a couple of things slightly  bent but not enough to cause a problem. It had a couple of spots where the paint was scratched but it wasn't enough to bother me . The birds seem to love it too. Great quality bird cage. I bought one for a sunconure and a second for a quaker. It\u2019s the perfect size. Impossible for parrots to escape when locked and good and water trays are easy to take out to clean food and water. Very good cage!  Our African Grey adjusted to this new cage almost immediately, and he seems to love it!  The crumb catchers on the side are a bit flimsy and the edges of the panels are rather sharp, so we chose not to use them.  We are impressed by the sturdiness of the cage itself, and would recommend it. Fantastic cage for the money.  Great price.  Super easy to put together even for a 75 year old woman.  I have always liked Preview cages in the past.  This time I decided to see if I could save myself a little money by putting it together by myself. The package was expertly wrapped and got here in super condition.  I had the cage together in less than two hours.  Now I have saved a bit of money for some bird toys. Thanks so much. Excellent cage for money. Went to a bird shop and this excact cage was more then double in price and didn\u2019t even have the top ladder and perch. Excellent quality, great size and easy to out together. None ", "Great cages for my conures.  Ordered different cages first for twice the money and half the quality!  They were poorly packed and bent. These cages were very well packaged and easy to assemble with the help of my grandson.  Love them. My only complaint is that they are not as tall as I would have liked but even that is not so bad. If you haven't upgraded your bird cage from the Petsmart variety-BUY THIS NOW!!! It's amazing! I have two cockatiels and they are loving it. It's easy to clean. I don't use the food dishes provided because I have others, but the cages design let's you use a variety of perches and configurations so I can use the dishes I have. It's also great to have the play top I can give them a bath on top and it's so much easier (they can stretch out). I love this cage and I wish I splurged for it earlier. First the good--this cage is perfectly sized for an Amazon or Grey, and was generally easy enough to assemble (although there is zero direction as to which way panels face, likely leading to panels being assembled backwards and having to be redone).  The paper trays slide easily and the play stand is adequate. I would give it 5 stars because our bird absolutely loves the cage, but the build instructions were very vague. Me compr\u00e9 esta jaula la de 18x18x57 para un Cockatiel la verdad me encanto! Muy f\u00e1cil de armar \ud83d\udc4clo \u00fanico que me arrepiento es el tama\u00f1o que eleg\u00ed \ud83d\ude22 se me hace muy chiquita. Pero se que es mi culpa \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f No lo visualice asta que la arm\u00e9 yo recomendar\u00eda el siguiente tama\u00f1o para que despu\u00e9s no se sientan como yo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f None This was very easy to assemble and it is exactly as expected. I had to remove the food and water bowls up top because my bird can lift out the bowls and throw them. But other than that, it\u2019s perfect. Great bird cage, not to hard to put together and all of the pieces were there.  Good quality too :-) I bought this for a pair of Parakeets. It's very nice and well made.  It doesn't take up much room but does sit a little low so you have to stoop over to say good morning.  If I were going to put a Cockatiel or larger however, I would get the next size up that Prevue makes just like this one.  I do like it very much.  It's very attractive in my office. This is an incredible cage, well built, roomy and very easy to assemble. Looks gorgeous in my living room. My indianringneck has plenty of space. Really happy about this purchase. I bought this and had to immediately return it.  The seed catcher was bent beyond use.  The main connector broke, and the cage could not be put together.  It was disappointing, and I cancelled the purchase of my bird since I didn\u2019t have a usable cage. ", "No shipping issues with damage as in some other reviews. The instructions could be better but I built it with little difficulty. FYI, the seed shields looks bent but that is by design. it all assembles rather easily. The birds love the roominess and the seeds no longer scatter on the floor like the smaller cage. They also like the stick on top. Highly recommended if you have the room. This is a great cage. We're using it for our eclectus parrot. It could be a bit bigger, but it is very good quality! Our bird climbs all over the inside and the outside and everything has held up wonderfully! I especially love how easy it is to access the inside food and water bowls. For what the cage is, it works. Once assembled this is a sturdy cage and easy to clean. I ordered 2 of these cages for my 2 green cheek conures that I have. So far they both are enjoying the play top gym quite a bit. My only negative comment about this product was the assembly. Some of the side panels were warped from shipping/packaging. It took a lot of tinkering around with to \"reshape\" parts of the product, though I will say you can't tell the struggle that went on when looking at the finished product! Some pieces were bent! Great cage! My bird loves it. I have a green cheek conure and she loves having her !morning berries up on the top perch ontop of the cage. It's super easy to clean. It was a bit smaller than I originally expected but still plenty of room inside. We had to add a bunch of custom perches because it only comes with 1 but other than that, we love the cage. I am very pleased with the quality of the cage. The assembly directions are sparse, but the process was straightforward, and I was able to put the cage together by myself (though having another set of hands would have sped up the process. Our green-cheek conure loves the cage and stand. I love it, my bird was a little intimidated at first by this big huge thing, but he's warming up to it. It was relatively easy to assemble, I did it myself. I love the seed catcher and it is also a very attractive cage and looks good in the house. What a bargain. Also I love how the bottom tray has bars around it. My bird will some times go to the bottom tray and eat the dropped food. I don't like that because the food is mixed in with the bird poop and can't be healthy. But now he can't get to the discarded food. I love that a lot. I can't believe I got such a great cage at this price. I'm very satisfied. Thank you. It's easy to clean and move a little smaller than I expected but still very happy with this purchase. I had a cage like this a few years ago, for which I paid about $400 at a local store. The bird I had at the time died, and I sold the cage for about $250. Plenty of room and well constructed. Doubles as a play yard on top. ", "nice cage...my african grey has plenty of room.  easy to assemble too. could use two people though but able to do it alone. pretty clor and nice playtop. Prevue has some of the best bird housing on the market. This our second purchase from Prevue and I highly recommend their products.  Yes, it takes a little time to put together, be patient, lay out all the parts first, and then follow the detailed instruction.  This unit, (3152BLK) took me 20 minutes by myself, however a buddy's help is always more fun. Our Quaker loves this cage and so do we!! It\u2019s perfect and well made and adorable as heck! I bought two, one for my Sun Conure and Jenday Conure. It took a couple of weeks for them to get use to it, now the love it. The cages are solid, sturdy and easy to clean. This cage is perfect for my sun conure, easy to put together. Easier with two people but could be done with just one person. Only problem I had was one of the bars for the top was bent a little. The cage trays were slightly bent out of shape upon delivery.  The cage is quite deep which is nice, but there are no doors on the back of the cage.  Affixing perches and toys is somewhat difficult without having access to the back of the cage.  I did not put the playpen on the top of the cage in order to keep more light filtering in from the top.  The food dishes are quite large, this cage is probably best used for a medium sized parrot.  The food dishes are too big for a cocktail or smaller parrot species. Got a whole lot more then I expected. The play yard on top has a tray under it, so you can remove all the litter when they go back in the cage. All of the parts are sturdy and feeding bowls are so easy to fill. has escacpe proof door which is a big plus for me as my african gray is an escape artist. The only thing if you are buying for a gray or larger you will need to purchase larger perches the ones that come with it are small diameter. All in All I would highly recommend this cage. I love the cage, i ordered the 36 x 24 x 66 i love the design and overall cage, the only thing i hate was how bent up some of the parts were. The shipping could have been handled better. its a shame so many parts were bent up. Got this in white and love it. It moves nicely on bumpy tile. I got it for my cockatiel and it\u2019s perfect for him Its a Great Cage! Very easy to put together and didn't need the instructions to do so! The Only Draw back is the Vertical bars with less horizontal bars! My Parrot is trying to get use to hanging on to the bars and gets a little freaked out! As we all know they have super beaks and use them to climb! Love the seed guard My floors stay clean!!!!! ", "This was a great product and came fast. Worked great and exactly how I wanted it. Very Happy :) Pain to put together but good cage Love this cage. Fits perfectly in our living room. The catch-all tray around the base collects everything she attempts to throw out. She loves to sit on top the open door and on top the cage. I love that it has wheels and is light weight so I can move it to vacuum. I have a sun conure who is a messy eater and pooper-  He spends a lot of time on the outside of his cage-  with my old cage there was food all over the floor and I was always cleaning up poop.  This cages seemed enormous when we first put it together but he has gotten used to it.  The seed/poop catcher is a god send and with the play top/tray the food stays on the tray or in the catchers. Disappointed some of the parts were bent. The seed catcher doesn't seem to be able to allow to be tightened at the bottom, however it still does the job. The cage looks nice and the directions for assembly were easy to follow. 3 stars because they could have prepared it for shipment better to avoid damage. Best cage I have purchased. Great for my African Grey. I ordered this in sage green. Really nice. Went together easily. Only problem I had was I assembled it with the feed dish side upside down, The instructions didn't say anything about which side up. Found my mistake when the food dish doors wouldn't lock but easily fixed. Only complaint I have really isn't a complaint. The instructions said to put the two shallow dishes on the top playground but all four of my dishes are the same size. They're fine. I'm happy. Best cage out there. I have 2 conures in this one. The size is perfect. Nice cage, easy assembly.  It's on the small size for an Amazon or other mid-sized parrot, but if they spend a lot of time outside the cage, it's fine.  Otherwise, it's best sized for cockatiels or lovebirds. I was a little concerned (ok, a lot concerned) about having to put this cage together but I figured if worse came to worse, I'd ask my son to come over and help me.  He's much better about doing that kind of stuff, but I don't believe he could have done it any easier or faster than I did. ", "This is a great cage and it\u2019s easy to clean! Everything is very sturdy! My only complaint is that my birds can\u2019t get from inside to the play top on their own. But I\u2019m sure I could figure something out. Easy set up, very hard on your own though i suggest you get someone to help you. The cage is sturdy, my quaker loves it and he especially loves the top where he can eat and play. The doors that open for the food trays are very useful because in the old cage he would fly out as soon as i opened the cage. Great price and size. Love the playpen on top, pull out tray is a a good distance from the bottom grating. All around good cage, only draw back is some of the screws don't fit because not all the holes aren't lined up and the paint is a lil sloppy. Black cap conure loves it. I'm very happy with this cage. I needed something small for my bedroom for him to hangout on when we're upstairs. He took to it right away exploring the playtop. It's well made and nice looking. And my Grey is happy with it as well. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Didn\u2019t think I would be able to put this together as easily as I did.  We haven\u2019t adopted our birds yet but when we do, i\u2019ll post pics with them in it. Love my new birdcage and so does my cockatiel ! I put this cage together by myself while my husband was at work and it was easy but took about 45 min to do alone. Very sturdy frame and I love the large front door and the side doors for the food and water bowls. Also, the wheels make it very handy to move from room to room. I highly recommend this cage to anyone with a cockatiel or smaller bird. I just got my new prevue cage. But screw is not going in on one of the sides. (Leftside panel of the main grill to the entrance). Can u sent a replacement only for that part? I'm a new bird owner and I bought this cage after doing a fair amount of research.  The construction is solid--the color is pleasant (I got the light green) and the extra drawer under the cage top play station is good for keeping things tidy. Only potential problem looks like the seed catcher may need to be removed to clean fully...so far so good. Just love this cage.I bought it for my green cheek conure it is the perfect size.It looks nice in my living room the only problem now is to get my little birdy to sit on the top play area he is frightened of it LOL Was very easy to assemble. Looks very nice and the bird loves it. ", "Niiiiice! Love, love love for my cockatiel! No issues when it got here besides a small bend and a small chip. No biggie though. Great quality cage. Great cage ! Good size I love the pull out trays makes cleaning easier . Good cage! Good quality! Very sturdy!  A little smaller than I would have liked The cage is great! A couple of small issues. Nothing that couldn\u2019t be figured out. For the price, I can\u2019t complain. Four stars because the small imperfections and quality isn't the best. But once assembled it is sturdy. It\u2019s a bird cage, not a Tigers. It will work. Assembly was easy EXCEPT for the roof. The metal was bent so I had to get a rubber mallet to force it into place. very sturdy! Being able to slide out the trays makes cleaning a breeze! Very nice cage.  Not the fault of the cage but I would order one that opened at the top instead of having to get my bird out of the cage to place her on the top.  Still ....really nice cage.  I put  it together in about an hour.  No problem. Great to have new cages for the exotic birds, only wish there was a way to have sealed all the holes in the hollow tubes that make up the corners.  I know the holes are part of the manufacturing process, but now they make great places for bugs to get into....yuk! And it is hard to use bug sprays around exotic birds because they are so sensitive. I\u2019m giving a one star because I could not attach my playstand because the top front was missing a hole. I was speaking to customer service through prevue and after several emails they stopped replying to me. Bad customer service. Don\u2019t recommend. Plus the top grate has a bent part. ", "Easy to put together, I did it myself and it only took about a half an hour.  My eclectus loves it b/c I leave it open and he can go back and forth from the play gym on top all day. Such a great cafe for my cockatiel!  Sturdy, quality design and was easy to assemble. easy to assemble & beautiful cage- I bought 2 - Quaker & a cockatiel This cage is easy to assemble, well made and is a perfect home for a Cockatiel. Great value as well! Just as represented!  Arrived a day earlier than committed (nice)! Lot of other reviewers complained about assembly instructions..... wasn't a big deal.  I completed it by myself in about 45 minutes -- was actually working in the home office, talking on the phone etc....  I did have to redo the side panel -- had the panel with the bowls on upside down initially (lol)!  Guess if I hadn't been doing other things concurrently... would have gone a little quicker.  At any rate, Spanky (Quaker) took to this cage immediately!  Plenty of room for toys, exercising his wings, climbing, exploring, etc.  The play top is a real treat for him as well -- attached a couple of toys there -- and he has a ball!  There was a small blemish in the paint on a seed guard -- does not bother me at all.  Like the color, matches our decor well!  Very satisfied with price, fit and function. Our parrot is really happy in his new cage. We especially love the stand above the cage as this serves as a two in one and is great for our small living room. This is a great cage. I have two parakeets & they are absolutely comfortable in this cage. I leave the door open so they can fly around the house & only keep food inside so they must fly I to the cage when they are hungry. The cage takes about a half hour to put together, but well worth it. It is well made & sturdy. It's alsoeasy to clean. I wipe it down weekly with a warm paper towel It's great purchase; the cage is practical, the right size and good quality, I recommend it Cage arrived in a very timely manner in two boxes and I my oldest son put it together with no problems!  My Goffin Cockatoo absolutely loves it!  She has plenty of room to move around in it and play!  Very high quality cage and highly recommend it! Overall great product. Cage is sturdy. It was very easy to put together. Everything arrived in good condition. Only issue is that the perch for the inside of the cage isn't cut properly and does not stay steady. Everything else is really great. Would buy again. ", "This large & sturdy cockatiel cage is very well made, more than big enough for my 2 tiels, providing them ample room for all their toys, bathing and nesting areas.  They were very happy with their new home and love the play area on top!  The cage was easy for me, a petite woman, to put together, and comes in many colors. I chose a color that matches my decor perfectly!  The seed guard keeps the area as clean as possible around their cage. It rolls easily on the caster wheels, and I like the locking feature to keep them safe when my young grandson is around. This cage has all the features that I have been looking for in a new cage. Anyone looking for a quality and easy to assemble cage, I highly recommend this cage.  It came to me in perfect shape and I put it together quickly with absolutely no problems.  Quality materials and finish. This is a great bird cage. I got it as a replacement. Jax loves it as well. It is easy to clean and is simple to assembly. Fair deal This bird house is a nice size for my cockteil. Nice quality. Easy to clean. My bird is very happy in her home. This cage is very nice, I had one for my Quaker growing up; however, the wire spacing is unsafe for smaller birds like Budgies. If you LOVE this cage and want one suited for smaller (keet) sized birds search for the Prevue Park Plaza, it doesn't have a perch on top, but it has the appropriate 1/2\" spacing to keep smaller birds safe and looks just like this one!! This is a nice bird cage.  I have it set up for my conure.  It was easy to assemble.  Delivery was quick.  I like the teal color as well. This is s very nice cage but definitely the bar spacing is too wide for a cockatiel. And too much hassle for me to return it. Does anyone in SoCal want to buy from me? It's all assembled! Great cage for my Indian Ringneck parrot. The cage was well packaged and easy to put together. I had to have some help with the seed catcher, but overall very easy to assemble. Also, I like how it comes with a bottle of touch up paint and a paintbrush. I usually don't write review but this one I have to write what a good quality this cage is I assembled the entire cage in less then 40 minutes clear instructions. ", "Some parts were a little bent but easily bent back into place. Great cage, and I was able to put it together myself. This is a great cage for my African Grey...she only stays in during the night and when I leave the house for a few hours. We needed to replace the very expensive poorly made cage we got from a pet store. Exactly as expected.  I had no trouble putting it together all by myself.... I'm 5'2, barely 100lbs.... so I'd say it's pretty easy!  Looks much better with my decor, compared to the previous cage.  And Oscar seems to be enjoying it! The cage came bended,  I can even insert some of the parts because it is miss aligned,  Jesus I am disappointed I was looking forward to giving little Wilson his new cage . Now somehow I have to repackage everything and ship it back , I cannot accept this My conure loves his new cage and is quite happy in it. Very sturdy. Love it..didnt use the side catchers yet cause it made it to awkward for my space but it's just what I wanted. The sage green color goes with everything in my sunroom. Great product. It came with no damage. Great, sturdy colorful cage. Only disappointments were part of cage was bent from shipping (was able to bend it back carefully w/pliers) AND coop (food and water) cups rusted near the tops after a few weeks of use (I simply use soap and water to clean them every day). They are stainless steel, but obviously not \"stainless steel.\" Cage comes with another pair (4 in all), and I am currently looking for replacements. For future reference, they hold 12 oz and dimensions are 4 3/8 width and 1 1/2 length. Great cage. Vertical design offers a lot of flexibility. You can pretty much make it a multi level home, sort of like a three story apartment. Make sure to pimp out the the top with modifications, toys, ladders and your birdie will be in birdie heaven My conure loves his new home! He loves hanging out in the second floor. It was easy to built except for the seed guard it was a little bit tricky! ", "Our cage is so damaged. And there is no way I could pack this up and ship it back. My bird cage from Prevue Pet Products is awesome!! I looked at a local pet store and a similar cage was 499.00 instead of the 175.00 I paid. It was heavy and sturdy and easy to put together. I give it five stars. It came quickly and living in Hawaii that doesn't often happen in fact many companies will not ship to us so I was thrilled. Thanks, Adella Quality craftsmanship. Solid and attractive. I've always loved Prevue bird cages! They're wonderful quality, and worth every penny. Also, I love the sage green color! Goes great with my peach front conure. This is a great cage by design. My green cheek settled in to it quickly and loves the play top. It is very easy to clean. Mine came with a piece damaged but after emailing Prevue I received replacement parts fairly quickly. The replacement parts were slightly mismatched to the color of my cage, but no big deal. It was pretty easy to assemble. This cage was easy to put together (I did it by myself which pretty much is an amazing feat in itself)  It looks nice, has held up well for  my Quaker, and does a good job of keeping the mess inside.  It's also super easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it. My 3 Month Year Old Cocatiel Loves Her New Cage!!!! I love the quality of it and the little play area thata attached on top of the cage. I just put on the seed catcher and can say it works well. Easy to put in though it took some time. It arrived a day or 2 Early. These cages are like little bird condos and my Bird Loves it! I Highly Recommend anybody to get this cage! I've had this for a while now years I came back to give a review to let you know that nothing ever chipped bent nothing ever broke on it. Quality is very good. Best bird cage.  Love it. The cage is great. I didn't rate five stars because one screw hole was not tapped to set the screw. I was able to put it together just fine. My featherly friend now has a nice home. ", "My bird sure loves this and it gives her plenty of space. 3 stars because those wing things make it really tough to clean the cage. I took them off and the cage works much better without them and fits better in spaces. I just received my Bird Cage via UPS late this evening and had it totally assembled before 10 PM.  I was quite impressed with the ease of assembly and while the instructions are somewhat vague, they didn't seem to slow down my progress. My Cockatiel, Stormy (a Hurricane Katrina exile from New Orleans)seemed to take to it quite well. His old cage was a bit wider, but not as tall as the new one. The old one had a smaller door, a plastic bottom tray, and I had it sitting in my room atop two tables. Now, with the rollers on the new cage, I can easily roll his cage around to vac under it. I think I paid around $60.00 plus for the old cage at a pet store years ago. I'm looking forward to hearing my old feathered friend whistling to his favorite Celtic songs again.  The best attribute of this cage it no doubt, its price. I have been looking for one along this line for a long time.  For the downside, I have none, but I can see where it would be more beneficial to smaller birds. My only advise would be to take your time putting it together, don't get in a rush, take a coffee break if you have to, and your fowl will be all the better..... I ordered this cage to replace an older, 18x18\" wire cage for my maroon bellied conure. I wanted one on wheels the same size or bigger with more  room for him to play. This was relatively easy to put together with 2 people and, although the plastic anchors for the wheels were broken, Prevue replaced them within 5 days. However, when I wheeled it over to the old cage something didn't look right. In fact, after measuring, the cage proved to be only 16\" x 16\" on the outside - much smaller than advertised. The box, the directions, everything was consistent with this 3151 model. I called Prevue and the man on the phone said that they didn't make anything smaller than 18 x 18 and it must have been Amazon's fault. Give me a break. The box came sealed and clearly labeled by Prevue. It is a real pain to take apart and the boxes are gone so I guess I will give it to a local parrot rescue to use as an isolation cage since it is way to small for even a parakeet's long term home.  And the little girl who was is waiting for her Christmas parakeet will have to wait a little longer until Gordon can be moved to the new cage I just ordered. I think it's great. I don't know how anyone had problems putting this together. There is nothing wrong with the directions and this couldn't have been easier. Easy to assemble and a great addition to my decor This could be a 5 star cage if Prevue had any type of quality control.  I received 2 of these cages and there were issues with each.  The first cage had many issues.  The biggest issue being the door was not welded or aligned correctly (no way to adjust) and takes significant force to open or close it.  Many of the bars were bent on many of the panels (I was able to straighten them to a point where it is usable), the holes are not aligned correctly to attach the top of the cage; the cheap bolts provided easily strip, there are several paint chips (guess that's why they include a touch up kit in box), the playpen perch does not stay in place as the slits cut into the side of the perch are too big and the perch I received was chipped at one end and there was rusty red marks on many cage pieces. This cage is very easy to clean and very spacious This cage is just right for me and my Female Vos Eclectus. Love the lock on the door. There's no way she can raise the bar like the other cage. And cannot reach the paper at bottom of cage, because 6 in. below the grill. Looks better in my tiny apt. too. Easy to put together with 2 people. I am so pleased with this new cage.  It was fairly easy to assemble.  You may need an extra set of hands, but for the most part, easy. It even came with a tiny bottle of touch-up paint and a little paint brush, just in case you scratch it while assembling.  I just love the design of it.  I am so happy to have round bowls instead of rectangular bowls for my parrot.  It's so hard to clean out those corners!  I am thrilled with the color.  We live in a 5th wheel and the color matches our leather furniture perfectly!  So, visually, it doesn't take up as much space as a black cage.  All of the other cages I saw were black, with the exception of a couple that were available in white. I have a Yellow Nape Amazon parrot.  I know that she should have more space, but for our situation right now, this cage is perfect. It's larger than what she had. She LOVES it. She can swing and play from her toy hanging from the \"ceiling\" inside the cage, and come out and play on top. The perches that come with it are too small in diameter for her feet, so my built her new ones.  It is sturdy, the door is very secure, it is very easy to clean and I just love it. My birds loved thier new home. ", "Perfect cage for our Green Cheek Conure. Is great quality. Would recommend! :) I definitely have some issues with this cage, but at the right price, it's worth it. I managed to get mine for $70 with prime free shipping; a few days later it was listed at $170. The manufacturer sells it for $100. Awesome cage,  really well built, easy to assemble -Sun Conure loves it! Great cage. Looks great in our home. Easy to put together. Better than expected! We leave the cage door open all day so that our red bellied parrot can climb up and down from the top. great quality Bought this for senegal parrot. Well built. Perfect size. We bought this cage for our Conure.  The cage has lot of room for Pepito.  I hose it once a week and airdry outside. She loves her big girl cage! Bought it for my miniature macaw and he loved it. Will have to buy another one for my blue crown conures. Cage is great quality. Very nice looking. Didnt come with 2 perches only came with one and only came with 2 bowls and 3 bowl holders. Instructions were not included and one of the plastic pieces to attach the wheels to the cage legs was missing. This is why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. ", "Great cage. Jenday conure loves it. Room for toys and ladders. No bird seed spraying all over. Would buy again Perfect! Was able to put it together myself n my husband helped to put the seed guards, everything fit perfect n had all my supplies! Very well made and sturdy. Easy to assemble. Great cage. Absolutely perfect for my cockatiel. Only took about 30 minutes to set up, and everything was there. The corners were carefully packed and reinforced in the box, and it arrived with no problems. Love it! What a deal! Sturdy, high quality, and well constructed. My bird loves this as a night cage. Bars are strong enough for an African Grey. So easy to assemble and a beautiful cage. My Senegal loves it. Great product. It took muuuuuuch longer than expected to receive though. Beware if you need by a certain date. We were okay because we were just replacing a cage we already had. This product came with all parts, was on time, and easy to assemble.  I will not be getting any other brand of birdcage in the future.  It looks great and is high quality.  I am delighted with my purchase! We priced this cage at several places and this was the best price...but price isn't everything.  It was advertised as a cockatiel cage.  It's not.  It is a cage for a small parrot.  There is a difference. The bar spacing is the absolute maximum so wings and feet don't get caught (3/4\" vs. 1/2\") and they should be the minimum of 24\" wide (vs. 18\") cockatiels like to \"pace\" back and forth.  I didn't check all that until after the fact because it was advertised as a cage for cockatiels. ", "The good, it's a nice looking cage.  Some of the pieces were damaged on arrival, and the box was actually missing a set of screws.  As far as putting it together it's not difficult but not intuitive either.  I'll likely return this and purchase a different cage. This is a fantastic new cage that I got for my green cheek conure.  It took her a bit to get used the height, as she was in a long but low cage, before this.  But she's adapted and climbs easily, like most green cheeks.  As always, Prevue has provided a great product. It\u2019s very simple to assemble, and has ample room for my parrot. Love how solid this cage is. The green look is modern and really sharp. The only draw back was the shipper damaged the box and made some small dents/scratches. I had a previous model it finally rust out. This new one looks better, the new latches are great. Great cage for our Quaker parrot. He loves his new home and I love that he is able to hang out on top from time to time. Also, he is unable to escape like he could his last cage. Beautiful cage poor paint job\ud83d\udc4eLook closely by the light and you can see so for the price of the cage you would think the paint job would had been done alot nicer so other then the door it's a pretty cage. Our cage arrived with several missing parts. Calls to Prevue customer service (which is a voice mail) were ignored. We finally had to go to Home Depot and with the cage to find parts to make it work as our poor new bird was in a box. Don't buy from this company. Even their toys stink! I bought two of these cages....great quality and easy to put together....yes there are cheaper cages from other companies but remember \"you get what you pay for !!!\". I was a little worried by some of the other reviews, but my cage was perfect! My only complaint is that it is a little smaller than I thought it would be and the instructions to put it together SUCK. They are very vague and caused me to spend way more time than necessary getting it assembled. ", "For the price, you can't beat this!  Awesome cage! Quality Build. Assembly Directions are poor but with common sense it is pretty easy to assemble. The most difficult part of assembly are the 4 seed catcher panels-pay attention to the grooves as they are specific to each side. Very good price on Amazon compared to pet stores. I am happy with this purchase. It's pretty much as advertised.  This is a roomy, heavy-duty cage.  My Amazon parrot has a lot of space.  All the parts arrived, only a few were scratched, but not badly.  There was touch-up paint included.  Be sure to use it in a well-ventilated area, because it has a very strong smell.  I rolled the cage outside to paint it. Great bird cage! This has been perfect for my Yellow Naped Amazon. It's big enough for him to stretch out, but not so big that he gets territorial. We've had it for a couple of years now and it's still going strong! Love the look of this cage. It is a very efficient home for my bird. There were only two small problems. One, the top portion of the cage was bent a little, but not noticeable. The second issue was that the holes on the top perch were not completely open and we can't store one of the feeding dishes up there. It was easy to put together. (Update) After finally recieving my bird cage 4 days late I am Happy to say that it was worth the wait this is a excellent bird cage and it was very easy to put together! Thanks so much for a great cage and its from my hometown Chicago which makes it a plus! It looks great on picture but when moving it it\u2019s quite flimsy Cage works great for Indian Ringneck Parrot Easy to put together, beautifully crafted, and intuitive design. There are two locking mechanisms and the cage is incredibly sturdy. I am IN LOVE. The instructions were not that clear but still was able to figure it out after some time.  Took about 45 minutes to build.  Very well packaged and comes with paint brush and matching paint to do touch ups.  Product is amazing my cockatiel loves it very much.  Lots of room to climb and play with her toys and the ladder above can be used to hang toys and such.  Very sturdy cage and very well built.  Easy to clean and catches all the flying food particles and feathers.  Must have aviary for any bird. ", "If your looking for a cage for a conure, this is the one.  Nothing but great things to say and it will last.  Great price for a high quality product.  These guys do it right! I love the bird cage I read how bad instructions were in reviews but found that they weren't bad at all. Anyone with any sense can take their time (20 minutes) and do it! That said I'am really pleased with this and my bird Loves it. Love this cage, easy to clean and a great size. The directions that came with it were the correct directions just very vague. FYI if you don't have the panels right the holes will not line up to screw it together. This cage is the perfect size for my Quaker Parrot, the only issue is the bars around the edges and door is too thick for him to be able to climb in and out and around the cage. He is happy in it, we just have to take him in and out. Was not sure if it was too big for our cockatiel...but perfect! He likes to hang out at the top most of the day when I am home! Good product for the money our 30 year old blue naped parrot is loving his new home. Had it for years! Zero issues. Just bought the travel Prevue cage. Love this cage!!  It is the same one that a national chain has locally, but this one is about 100.00 cheaper.  Very easy to clean. Yes, you still have to clean up after your birds...doesn't stop everything, but I don't believe that there is a cage that would. You won't regret purchasing this cage. Was shipped quickly and arrived on time. When i got it one piece was bend. I easily fixed it so i assume it was bend in travel. Took about an hour to put together. Everything linded up correctly. Aside from the bend piece the perches they send arent for this cage. They do not fit properly. But they are cheap at petco so its not a huge deal. It was $130 for me and i suppose you get what you pay for. But now that the cage is up its beautiful and sturdy. My green check with love it. ", "This bird cage is a nice size and my cockateil loves it.  Easy to clean as well. I am so happy with this cage, I can't say enough about it.  Came safely packed, no shipping damage at all. Easiest cage I've ever put together. Even comes with a small bottle of touch up paint and a brush. My green cheek conure loves it. I purchased this cage for my green cheek conure.  The cage was very easy to put together with the exception of the seed guards, they were a little awkward for one person to manipulate but I finally was successful in assembling them.  The cage is smaller then I hoped for, I would suggest the next size up for a bird the size of a conure or cockatiel. Excellent product!!! Great quality cage!!!! I have one problem about the design of the cage. The apron around the cage is screwed together. It is hard to unscrew the apron to clean the area. Actually it's annoying!!! Perfect cage for my conure. I have had many cages over the years and this is by far the best I have had. The price is right, bar spacing, and material are all great. It is really easy to clean as well. Love this cage. Love the wheels and the door latch. Overall the cage is a good value if you price shop. Great deal! I got it for my cockatiel. ", "well it wasn't overly difficult to put together although I am pretty handy, I had a couple moments of WTF while working, they \"seed / splash\" guard is useless just makes the cage to big, crap still gets all over, guess if you had a tiny bird it would work, I have a Green Cheek Conure in mine and he loves it... Fast service , fair price . Love this cage and have several of them, they hold up to the birds chewing on the bars and the locks work well too, the cage is roomy enough to hang toys in and add perches in several different places .... This is a nice well thought out design and is very sturdy. The birds might love it but we like it! Would purchase again. It was very easy to assemble. One skirt was ever so slightly bent, but i was ably to straighten it quite easily. Lots of room for the cockatiel, probably too much room. The food containers are ok, seem too deep for the bird. Amazing cage! The price point is great and so is the quality. We have a very happy green cheek! My teen put the cage together and she said it was easy. Captain Billy seems to like it, he is a Green Checked Conure and this seems to be a good sized cage for a bird that size. The materials are very nice, sturdy and fit well. Very happy with this purchase. The cage looks good. Very easy to clean and easily movable for it being so big. Nice food bowls and I don't know why others were complaining but, it was pretty easy to assemble. Although, 2 people assembling the cage is recommended. Color looks better in person. This cage is best suited for birds the size of a cockatiel or conure. My bird absolutely loves it. This cage is absolutely amazing. Very well designed and great for small to medium sized parrots. Only small issue was some of the hex screws were hard to screw in because the screw holes had paint in them. Not a big deal and we're extremely happy with the product Great product ", "Excellent cage for my conure!  Sturdy and well made product materials.  Absolutely pleased. This cage is the best! Great quality. It was pack great and I put it together by myself in no time. When my husband came home was surprised that I put it together and said it was a really nice looking bird cage.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Just put it together and my bird is already spending all his time at the top. He seems to love it so I'm giving it 4 stars. I can't give it 5 because the structure is a bit odd on this cage--not everything aligns right and it got a little banged up on its way here. I just purchased this bird cage for my African Grey parrot and I was very pleased. He loves it and it fit perfect where I put it. I\u2019ve used this cage to keep Cockatiels and Conures and they\u2019ve done great in it. Easy to assemble and keep clean. I like this cage overall, but it came with a lot of bent up parts that I had to rig together. Amazon was nice and partially refunded me. Nice cage but can be hard to clean if you bird sits in the top railing (like mine has always insisted on doing) because the seed guard has to be unscrewed to remove it for washing.  Had a damaged lower tray that was replaced with no problem, excellent customer service! Bought this cage for a new Quaker Parrot. The design is pretty solid but the base that catches food around the sides has spotty directions. My girlfriend managed to put the cage together in about an hour so it wasn't an unbearable challenge. Cage comes with extra touch up paint which is nice.  I'd recommend getting better, more natural tree branch perches to prevent sore feet. Overall the cage was just what we needed for the bird we have. Also I've noticed this cage is at least $100 cheaper here than at any pet shop I've been to. It's a nice cage, it wasn't that difficult to put together, you just have to take your time.  My bird seems to really enjoy it, it's nice and roomy and attractive.  I think if I were designing it I would put both dishes near the front of the cage, one on each side, it would make it easier to arrange the toys and perches without worrying about them messing in the dishes. Set it up all by myself with little to no problem! ", "CAGE IS REALLY GREAT. MY PARROT WILL LOVE IT ONCE HE GETS USED TO IT.I BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY CAGE TO LEAVE AT MY DAUGHTERS HOUSE WHEN WE TRAVEL. Great cage for my Green Cheek Conure....my 11 year old granddaughter and me put together easily Love the product. Price is good. Went together nicely. This product came well packaged and was very easy to put together. I was able to assemble the cage by myself in about 45 minutes. The instructions were clear and simple to follow. This cage is exactly what I wanted for my Green Cheek Conure. Mannie is a small bird but he is very active and this cage gives him lots of room to climb and play while not taking up too much space and it looks great. Great The only thing Hawkeye doesn't like about his new home is that he can't reach the new carpet \"cage liner\" and tear it up after it has been changed, other than that he seems perfectly happy with it.  So am I come to think about it. Of course that is the reason we bought it. I've had lots of cages for my pigeon-sized  parrot and hated them all. This cage is just plain incredible. Easiest to clean that I've ever known. Design is genius. Catches most mess too. Cleaning is no longer a chore. Am I in heaven? This is NOT for an African Grey.  It is too high and narrow, with the bird being chest heavy, and could cause seriously injury if she falls that far to the cage floor.  The metal is much thinner than what I would have bought if I had seen it in a store.  It came to the house bent, rusted and damaged.  Most disturbing is that the too DEEP food bowls are placed too close to the perch which is going in the wrong direction for eating, dipping and drinking and there is no room in the front part of the cage to add a perch that does go horizontal to the bowls.  Complete waste of money.  This will be donated to a bird sanctuary. Nice cage. My only complaint is that I had to attach a ladder for my bird to get on top without assistance. We leave the cage open and she likes to go in/out on her own. It was easy to assemble and there was no damage at all. We have two cockatiels and they love this spacious cage.  It has worked out wonderfully and has been easy to clean and keep up. ", "I am impressed by the quality of this cage. It was easy to put together, it looks good and cleanup after the bird is easy. My bird has not yet figured out how to make it to the top when I open the cage but I am sure he will after a few days. He seems to have adjusted quickly to his new \"palace\". This cage is perfect. We have a mini macaw who spends most of the time outside his cage. The play top allows him to hang out on his cage and play and eat. It is perfect for him and he enjoys it. 2nd replacement still damaged but mush less than first! Rusting chipping not even a month old. Very well built sturdy cage. easily put together, everything lined up perfect. My bird loved it right off the bat. Price is also excellent. Very Happy My 14 year old Sun Conure needed more room.  He seems to love it.  He has a little trouble climbing to the top of the cage but has no problem going up the ladder.  It is sturdy, was easy to put together and easy to clean.  the seed guards around the cage work great.  A very nice color- coco brown- for the living room-he likes to be in on all the action-  I would recommend this cage -there is plenty of room. quick delivery- Great Cage Built well and I was able to assemble within an hour. No missing pieces and the handy tool that was provided made it a lot easier I love this cage. It is exactly as described. I wish it was a bit taller where the legs hold the cage up higher off the floor but it works great for my Green Cheek Conure. I bought my last bird cage 12 years ago for over $1000, but the company has since gone out of business so I found this great priced cage and thought I would give it a try.  Well, I got what I paid for!  After using a gift card, the total was $150 - nearly 1/10th of the price of the cage that has lasted me 12 years.  I suspect this cage will not last nearly as long as my last cage.  It is import quality - has numerous defects.  The company claims you can get any part replaced, but I would have to request them all!  Paint chipped in many spots with numerous dents and dings. I love it ! I saw little chipped off, but My bird didn't care the chip off.  My Quaker loves new cage. cleaning easy. A very sturdy cage, purchase this larger size to replace a smaller one of the same brand my bird was growing out of. Did a lot of shopping around and no one could beat the price on Amazon. ", "Very study and nice looking. Nice strong metal! My Cockatiel loves this cage.  I am very happy with it! I have cats and dogs as well as the parrot so I found the cage too low. I put it up on an old stand from another cage and it worked quite well. I have had it for almost a year and it is holding up. Very sturdy strong cage.  My two Indian ring necks love it.  Was easy to put together. This cage is perfect for my African Grey but only because she is on top all day and only stays in the cage at night. A little small for a bird that does not get out :) Bought this for my Yellow Naped Amazon, Paco. She LOVES it!... As in other reviews the instructions were not so great! however, with the picture of it, it was simple to figure out. My adult son put it together with the help of his 12 year old brother! There was one bar that was bent, but nothing to complain about! Very easy to clean, tray slides right out. Great quality and easy to move Great size. Really gives the right amount of space that my Amazon Parrot deserves. She will definitely be enjoying the set up on top. I am very happy with the cage they sent us went together very easy . great my African  grey loves it ", "I love it! Easy to put together and is very clean and sturdy! My Congo African grey has one a little hard to get used to from a smaller cage but it is a very nice cage once assembled the instructions aren't the best and seems flimsey at first but I love it. I also did get a broken part called/emailed and sent out a replacement right away! I love it!!! I bought this cage for my Quaker parrot.  It is fantastic!  Arrived in one day, packaging was excellent, the corners were all reinforced on the box and it was all banded.  Inside everything was bubble wrapped and banded together, it was in perfect condition.  I was a little worried because I had read that it was difficult to put together and the instructions were bad.  I had no problem at all, did it completely alone and the instructions were fine. It took me from removing from the box to finish about an hour.  The cage itself is beautiful!  And so well constructed! My Quaker took right to it, climbing and inspecting it as I was putting it together.  She slept in it the first night.  Don't be shy about purchasing this cage, you will love it.  There is room for birds up to an African grey size.  My little quaker has tons of room!  I have no negatives to say about it. Nice cage, rough edges on seed guard. Very nice cage! Solid, and prevue will help if you have any issues... My perches were a little frayed, no problem, replaced! I would recommend! Well constructed, easy to assemble, and escape proof ! This is a beautiful cage.  I love it It was a last minute decision to get a Quaker Parrot for xmas and I found this cage on Amazon.  It was a better price than any comperable cage I could find - not to mention that I received it the very next day after I ordered it with free prime shipping. The directions were not the best so I take a star away, but it went together very easily and is well designed. No regrets on this one and I recommend it. Absolutely love this cage! My 2 conures are very happy with their new home and play yard! everything came in amazing condition and was really easy to put together! Thank you so much! ", "We have 2 of these for sugar gliders. They are attractive and give them space to climb. Since they are tall vs wide they don't take up space and you don't need a table to set the cage on. Well built, heavy made. This is not a flimsy cage as many others out there are. Very nice for the price. I wish the sides were a little bit stronger for add on toys food bowls ext.  my African gray loves it very easy to keep clean. I would Recommen to a friend. the quality is great - the price is even greater!  love the easy open doors for food and water and the extra lock to make sure that the kitties don't figure it out Awesome product and fast shipping My cockatiel loves his new home. Not big enough for a larger bird. Easy to clean up and like the seed guard. We love it and our cockatiel loves it! So much room and it's beautiful. Will match almost any decor and you'll have a very happy bird. I read almost all the reviews before purchasing this cage.  Most of the negative reviews I read were about the instructions.  I did not find anything wrong with the instructions.  In fact, they were pretty much step-by-step on how to put it together.  I am in my 50's in case anyone thinks I am right out of school and some techie.  It is very sturdy and bird proof.  In case you have a bird that is constantly trying to escape this cage is a minerature Alcatraz.  Cannot say enough good things about this cage! Sturdy and last long seed shields flimsy...& ill fitting...otherwise very nice ", "I love this cage. Easy to assemble the quality is outstanding.  So easy to get my bird in and out of and to move the cage around. I am going to order another for my other bird. The seed catchers around the cage word wonderful. They really do help to keep the seed off the floor. I don't leave reviews but this cage is amazing. I found it in several pet stores for twice the amount I paid. I bought it for my green cheek conure it's as big as a house for her plenty of room. Assembling was very simple and easy would recommend for anyone with a medium size bird My vet approved, my conure loves his cage. Great slur, easy to assemble, easy to clean. The cage was as expected, however the seed guard was very disappointing.  After working with it for several hours, it just didn't come together to form a good fit.  It was bent out of the package so I have to order a new guard. The cage itself is n8ce, but I paid for this cage to help reduce what ends up on my floor.  As an alternative, I will most likely go to a plexiglass cover.  I wish it worked as advertised. I bought this for my cockatiel. My other one has a king cage and it is very comparable. Well made and my bird is happy! Great product, easily put together. Very study! This is a great cage for the price. Went together very easy. I did not even use instructions. Inside bowls lock down so bird cannot dump them out. Easy to clean. Deep trays work great with cracked corn. It is a nice size cage for my cocktail. My one strong criticism is the vertical bars on the front Our parrot will not be able to escape from this thing!  The directions were good, it went together easily.  The food doors are really nice; I don't have to risk losing any blood from reaching my hand in the cage.  The food doors swing open so that you can easily fill them. Love this cage. It was easy to assemble by myself, used the couch to prop against instead of having someone else me. My Conure loves it! ", "was a little hard to put together due some parts were bend Nicely made very sturdy and stylish very easy to put together and beat petsmart &Pets supply plus price by $50 -$100 None This is a great parrot cage. Really solid. Nice looking. Highly practical. Easy to put together. Our parrots love it and we do too. Bought this for my conure. He likes the cage. Only issue is the top porch, that my wife does not like. There were some chipped and rusted areas on the brand new cage, that is why I am giving a 4 star. Great cage with a great color. It was easy enough to put together. The color and design is true to the picture. The cage is well built and easy to keep clean. I have never owned a bette cage in my life. They even sent a tiny canister of paint in case of chips! This is a wonderful cage, well-made and very sturdy.  The instructions are a joke, but I managed to get it together in a reasonable amount of time.  My Quaker Parrot adapted quickly and seems very happy in it.  I like how the feed bowls can be swung out so if someone other than me feeds him they won't get bit!!  It is very easy to clean too. This cage is so nice and easy to put together. My two Parrotlets live in this big house, with no problems. I love the fact it's on wheels. My birds are happy and so am I. I have to agree with several other reviews that mentioned the horrible gas/diesel smell that filled my living room after opening the box. I located the source of the smell on the black caster wheels. Love this cage, not too small and not too bid, has built in play stand, great price... ", "Good size and excellent quality it is perfect for big birds and easy  to clean I just love that part,is not to heavy and is all in metal so your bird is going to be save and happy in this big cage. We really like the cage, nothing bent or broken, but the side panel opposite the food dishes is rusted through in some spots.  It looks like it was painted over the rust because I can scrape off some of the paint and I am finding rust underneath.  I am just going to scrape off the rust and paint over those spots I guess.  It won't be powder coated in those spots though.  Hopefully it won't be too noticeable.  Pretty shoddy workmanship for this manufacturer.  They need to tell their painters to remove the rust before they do the painting. I am thoroughly please with my Prevue Pets  purchase.  The cage was very easy to assemble (with the help of my 9 year old) and my baby cocktail loves his new habitat! Very nice high-quality birdcage! Awesome cage. Easy assembly. I have a GCC living in one now! Bought this cage for my green cheek Very nice, right size, seems very well made...overall very satisfied. Nice sturdy cage , very pretty . My bird loves it. After owning this cage over a half a year.  I can definitely say its a well made cage and enough space to keep my 2 Sun Conures. Great size for a sleeping cage for large bird like cockatoo....?But my bird opened the feeding doors in five minutes and got out and ate a door in my house,so I had to ode lock both feeding doors.. ", "I purchased the 18x18x57 and it's the perfect size for my cockatiel. Byrd loves her cage! The tray works really well. Some feathers and shavings do escape but for the most part they all fall into the tray below with the help of the outer \"wings\". The perch on top is pretty awesome addition to the cage. Very simple to put together and is very very very well made. The Cage is good the bed Think is sicru when assembledet its not exekly majore the holl  enader wise its biuti really nice cage My lucky is love play ride way Great value Came damaged and wonky. Very unclear instructions. Weak bolts with a wrench that was the wrong size so I stripped the first bolt. I thought it was easy to put together. Perfect size for my 1 conure, I'm using this as a play area. Petey loves his home! Does the job but not stylish at all. Great product. But it was too small for my Indian ringneck. Good for smaller birds Well made and a great price! I bought it for a cockatiel, but my GCC loves the ladder and play top more than she does! ", "Purchased this bird cage from amazon and love it.  I have a Macaw and he is on an outdoor perch all day but in the cage when we are gone and at night.  The cage is light in weight for easy movement and the trays come out very easily for cleaning.  The lock on the door is awesome so that no bird can open it...it is a spring lock with an additional tab to hold door closed.  They even sent touch up paint and did not need it. Very well made, but was too small for my Blue Crown, I returned to go with a larger size. Pieces arrived bent. Some of the holes were not fully punched out and had to be forced. Honestly expected a better product. Very well made price is great saw same cage at major Pet store for 279.00. Very easy to assemble. I wish there had been a 3 1/2 star rating.  I've had to improve with some ingenuity to get this cage comfortable for my Quaker Parrot to use.  The top tray of the cage was making it too difficult to step down from or up to.  So if she was on top of the cage she couldn't climb down to the lower cage area on her own.  Quakers love to climb so tall cages are always recommended for them.  I was finally able to fix this situation for her by connecting a rope perch from the top rung of the ladder to the cage just above the door.  She is now happy to use the rope perch to climb back and forth.  I think it is unethical for a company to include only one interior perch for any cage.  I have started using the branch style perches that screw in place for additional perching/climbing.  I also have placed a wooden ladder in the cage to help her explore ect.  She enjoys her cage and that is what is most important.  However a few tweaks here and there would make this cage more user friendly. Purchased the 18x18 for my cockatiel! Put it together myself. Seed catcher isn\u2019t perfect at catching all the seed but that\u2019s my only complaint thus far! Wonderful. Sturdy. Airy. Roomy. Great value on a quality cage It is perfect for my green cheek conure.  Plenty of room for toys, etc.  He loves it.  Great fitting seed guards.  Easy to assemble.  It arrived early. Since I move it each night into a quiet room, I am impressed on how easily to rolls on the casters.  Could easily accommodate two birds.  I love it as much as he does. The seed catcher is useless. This is a top quality product with great customer service ! I highly recommend this product. This is our second cage by Prevue. ", "Last review was removed, I wish I could give less than one star as I found Prevue pets to be a company that takes no pride in their product and would not stand by multiple defects. After extensive communication with prevue there was no compassion or resolve from them. I was sent a tiny bottle of paint for a cage that was unusable and dangerous. This cage had so many faults and posed so much risk to my bird that it went in the trash. For this reason I recommend avoiding a company and their products such as this. If you currently have any product by them, look it over very carefully. Metal fragments ingested in your bird or animal can be fatal. I have had Preview cages before. Needless to say this one does not disappoint. Beautiful cage. Be prepared to spend several hours putting it together. Total bs. There is nothing wrong with this cage or how much my bird loves it. Arrived packaged well.  Easy for me to put it together.  Bird loved it.  Bought another for my other one.  Have two  and the other bird constantly wanted to be in this cage.  Different breeds cannot be kept together. This is very sturdy. Firm can be knocked over while I'm cleaning it. I'm thinking of buying another for a different room. Not heavy to carry. I'm 5'3 135 lbs. and a girl. This is a pretty great cage for my little Green Cheek Conure. It is the perfect size and he loves the little perch on the top. However, while putting it together I found quite a few issues with parts being bent up and some of the holes for bolts not lining up. Not sure if the dents were from shipping or if they happened in factory. Fast shipping -  cage quality very good, highly recommended -  I  use this for my Amazon parrot I like the cage.  It's perfect for my bird Great Price on this birdcage. Very well made and perfect for a small to medium sized bird. ", "Nice cage for the price easy to assemble Love this cage (my GCC loves it too).  I especially love how easy it is to clean. My parrot loved it immediately. It was easy to assemble it. It is nice looking cage. The wheels are great, cage is easy to move around when cleaning under it. Design is very parrot and human user friendly. kinda frustrating to build a few of our parts did not fit quite right, but it is a great cage once it is built we keep a cinni green cheek conure who seems to enjoy it. Is great for a Parrots. Easy to clean. Parlanchin is very happy with your new \"home sweet home\". Is excelent!! very happy with it, perfect for my sun conure! Great bird cage. Well made. Super easy to put together. Only took 20-30min from unboxing to done. It came a little bang up, but is easy to put together, the splashers are wonderful, space is big enough for a caique (more like a caique palace ;-) ) My bird & I are super happy with this cage.  The price I purchased it at was $140 less than similar cages at pet stores.  The quality is great for the price, it is well designed and nicely finished, the included bowls and perches are top quality.  The seller shipped the product very quickly; the cage arrived well before the initially promised delivery date.  It was very well packaged & protected for shipping and arrived undamaged despite UPS beating the heck out of the box.  All parts were included, along with some spares, and there was even a small bottle of touch-up paint in the event any rubbing occurred during shipping.  Assembly was straight forward and easy, although the directions were a little outdated (some screws shown were replaced with hex bolts instead).  The only issue with the cage were the rubber balls on the casters.  They were evidently recently produced and producing VERY strong-smelling fumes - not good for your birdie's delicate respiratory system.  I set them aside to air out for the time being.  A small & easy to fix issue on an overall great purchase.  Highly recommend. When I received this cage there were a few problems, the play top and the tray were both bent and then the food door ring holder was plugged with excess paint/powder coating. Prevue sounds like they are going to replace the pieces... I hope they follow through. ", "It was just what write up said it would be.  Got it for new bird. Muy buen producto None Great product. As described and very well made. Heavy duty. Best of all, my cockatiel very much approves! Love this cage.  Assembly instructions not very detailed.  Found great instructions on YouTube.  Very easy to put together!! Well made cage perfect for our cockatoo.  Easy access food doors and tight locking door. It arrived faster than I expected, was easy to assemble, and is exactly as it is depicted.  My bird is happy in it. My bird loves his new home Well made and easy to assemble. Had to put in a beefier perch, but that was expected. Some of the parts were bent, easy fix. One screw does not want to go in, another easy fix. Great cage for 2 cockatiels. They love it! Door size could have been smaller. And food bowl locations could have been lower. ", "I already had one of these cages for 2 other birds. It's so easy to clean I ordered another! Love this cage and so does my conure. It looks nice in my living room too. Arrived bent in multiple locations and not all the metal was actually punched out of the holes in in multiple locations which made assembling quite fun. I received this product in damaged condition. Bent in about 6 different places making it very hard to assemble. I had to try an re-bend the pieces back in order to be able to make the pieces join. The top perch assembly was so out of square that I can't get the ladder to line up in the holes provided so it sits on an angle. Good quality Perfect for my little guy Great size cage for my cockatiel.  Came as expected with minor bent parts. Less cleanup but the catcher did not solve the complete problem  of seeds on the floor. Great cage so far. This product is just what I expected! I love it! But some of my pieces did come bent I bought this for my daughter, at her request.  She is 16 & put it together by herself in a few hours & says her bird loves it & so does she! Larger than I expected, super easy to put together and great quality! ", "This cage is as expected with the exception of the paint. It arrived marred in several places, touchup paint is provided. It assembles in less than 30 minutes. My bird loves this product. Very easy to clean, even comes with extra paint to touch it up occasionally. Great for my Quaker... Great sturdy cage, everything came in correctly. And none of the bars were bent like the other reviews said. I didn't have to bend one piece but that was probably my fault Really wonderful Saturday cage, just came with a couple dents I had to bend back. the cage itself is ok...the cleaning is a hassle! It's impossible to get the seeds out of the seeds catcher...It takes me an hour to clean the cage! Its a very nice cage but the play ground stick is crack and bent. And its only came with one wooden stick for the interior. Excellent cage - well made, solid. Seed catcher is better than not having one at all, but my Green Cheek Conure manages to throw stuff anyway. He loves this cage. We love this cage , our green cheeck Conure loves it to once he got use to it. This is a fantastic product for the price. It's attractive and functional. ", "My cockatiel loves his cage! This is a heavy and sturdy metal cage that requires two people tackle it, so that one person can hold panels together while another persons fastens them securely. The included long and short hex screws and bolts are sized appropriately. Great cage for our Amazon Grey Parrot.  Good quality and easy to put together.  Our  bird has plenty of wing space for when flapping and exercising. Good quality, all parts there, easy to put together Came in perfect shape. Not too difficult to put together. Very high quality.

Also the demensions stated were not for the actual cage, so it was really not tall enough.  the measurements were for the total height.  We tried to exchange, but were told you cannot exchange with a bank card?  So now other things have come up and our bird is still in his old cage. ", "Works perfect for our cockatiel. Easy to clean. Sturdy. This cage is perfect for my Green Cheek Conure, he loves it and it's super easy to clean! Best cage I could find and great price! Green Cheek conure loves this home! Perfect size! I don't know if I \"love\" this cage as much as I thought. First, the silver bowls that came with it. Cracked. I didn't know a metal bowl could even break? I don't do anything but gently clean it and put it back in their cage. They wouldn't even replace it for free! I had to repurchase all of the ones that broke. Anyways now about the cage. He lock is broken. And one of the spacing bar whatever you call it. Is broken! I wasn't aware and I heard my bird scream the living hell out of his body. So I went to check up on him and to see his head was stuck between the bars. This cage is not even 2 years old and it is already breaking down! Do we even have a warranty? I thought this cage was suppose to be heavy duty????? Great cage for the price. Very sturdy for my Grey. Castors roll easily. Only thing I wish it had  was a door for a breeding box. Very easy to assemble by yourself. 5 stars for this bird cage! I am very satisfied with this product.  My 11 year old daughter could assemble it.  It is strong and durable. I bought this cage for my black capped conure. She loves all the space and I'm very happy with the quality of the cage. Great cage and well built. I recieved the cage and it is missing the top bird portion. Really disappointed. ", "This product far exceeded my expectations; especially for the price base Wonderful quality and built well. Easy assembly. Our Conure loves his new home!  The only thing I wish it had was more perches  I had to run to the pet store that day to buy perches. It was easy to assemble, very sturdy, and looks great.  Some pieces were slightly bent, but they were easily fixed with a pair of pliers.  The seed guard does its job.  With 2 budgies in this cage, they have plenty of room to fly and we have lots of room for their toys.  We couldn't be happier. Beautiful cage as described. Easy to assemble, arrived quickly! easy to clean Finally.  High quality and affordable. my birdies are happy in their boxes This cage is great for my cockatiel.  The instructions are vague at best and don't include how to put in the seed trap that goes around the cage but it's simple enough to figure out on your own.  It took me about 20 minutes to put together and it is beautiful. Easy to put together with two people, awesome price Very nice birdcage. Well packaged..easy to assemble. Sturdy. Satisfied customer with a happy Cockatiel. ", "Love this cage and especially the choices of colors! Saved a lot of money buying from Amazon....the pet store wanted $150 more than what I paid for the same cage!! Excellent he loves it! It is a Gorgeous color and  easy to assemble.  The quality of the cage is outstanding and packed well for shipping! Very easy to keep clean. The removable trays are lovely. My conure duo love the cage as well! Built in play top is a good size even for a larger bird. Exactly what was described. Perfect for my two conures. Shipping was fast and the assembly was easy. Love it!!  Easy to put together!  Only thing is my wife and I are a little bit disappointed on the fact the bird seed still ends up on the floor. Quality cage for a great price! The best cage i ever bought...period. A wonderful bird habitat.  Great buy for the money. Excellent ", "Cheap Chinese product. Is it was fairly easy to put together. The reason for the one star is the front frame to the cage was bent along the entire length which prevented the bottom waste tray to be placed in so I had to awkwardly place it underneath the cage. The seed catching plates don't fit together due to also being bent. The bad part regarding the bent parts is the boxes they were put in were not ripped which meant this company doesn't care or have quality control. Plus I'm not gonna pay the crazy amount to try to get a replacement back from china. My African Grey loves to sleep in my room and now she can in her new sleeping quarters my birds love it Well made and good price. Excellent for the price. My wife was very surprised and happy with this bird cage for Christmas. The wheels are a great feature for bringing the bird around closer to us when we want For my Budgie Rio Great materials & strong , thank you We have 1 parrotlet. We needed something to contain seed mess, something solid to withhold dog/cat curiosity, and something that looks clean and nice in the main room.. I've reviewed many cages and finally decided to settle on this one. We plan on moving into a very small home (300 sq ft or less) so having anything too big (or wide, rather) to start out with would be a bad idea. This cage however just seems perfect so far. Awesome!!! ", "Very well made, reasonable price. Easy set up and shipped free to Puerto Rico nice Nice cage but the pan that catches the food doesn't fit quite right. Nice looking though. great cage my parakeet loves it. Great cage , great price Love the cage. Super easy to put together. Took me 10 minutes to put it all together. My green cheek loves his cage. Sturdy, larger than described. They thought of everything. My Quaker Parrot Loves her new cage. Very nice, high quality and sturdy cage. This cage might seem extravagant for a lovebird, but the better the cage, the better your bird's life will be - and yours, as well. Easy to assemble, easy to clean, and safe for your feathered friend. The door and seed gates close securely, and the seed guard assures that you'll spend more time with your pet than your vacuum cleaner. You won't beat the size or quality for this price. I'm going to get another for my cockatiel. excellent ", "A bit of an IQ test butting it together  but looks great. Am  assumming that the price redu nn Well built, very happy with this Love it! The cage is sturdy and well-designed, it arrived in excellent condition with all the parts plus some extra screws and nuts. It took about 45 minutes to assemble, but half of that was just getting it out of the very protective packaging. I only wish it had slightly taller legs, even just 3\"-4\"would help, so my jenday conure would be a little higher when inside the cage - but it is already much better than most cages that way. Just what I wanted. Great cage My bird loves his Condo! Was shipped out really fast. Was easy to put together. My little bird Mango loves her new home. worth every bit of money. Food doors are easy to get too without our bird getting out. overall, a great cage. Also has wheels to move .. It\u2019s very comfortable for the bird well thought out we call it the mansion Quality, sturdy cage that assembled easily.  Birds love it! ", "I am very impressed with this cage. It took some time to assemble but was not very complicated. Good construction and finish. I expect this to last a long time. When ordering be sure to check \"more buying choices\". I paid much less than the default price initially shown. I like the bird cage, so does my bird. It was easy to assemble. The one complaint I have is the catch all does not catch all. It does help but my conure is a messy bird and it does not attach very well to the cage so alot of his food ends up on the floor anyway. :( Both I and my African Grey love this cage. When I was putting it together, I got worried that it wouldn't be very strong because the side panels \"slide\" down on a track between the back and the front. In all honesty, it hasn't been a problem at all. The cage is very sturdy, and the wheels make it super easy to wheel outside on cleaning day. African Greys can be pretty hard on cages with their powerful beaks, and this cage has held up incredibly well. The bar thickness is great.  All in all, I like this cage and if (when) it finally wears out, I'll definitely purchase another one. my bird love it Purchased for a Quaker parrot.  There is plenty of room in the wrought iron select bird cage.  Good quality cage for a medium size bird and a decent price. Quick delivery. My little bird and I love this cage!!

Some Of The Holes Wouldn't Line Up Correctly And Was a Little Small, Made It Hard To Get Some Of The Bolts In, I Stripped 2 or 3 Bolts, But I Like The Cage Now That It Is Put Together. Instruction Could Be Much Better Also. Great product, a bit pricey though. Cleans up with ease. My Tango and Many love it so that is what it is all about.

This is my second Prevue cage; both cages had some minor damage. was fairly easy to assemble and has met the expectations that I was requiring - very easy to keep clean and good price I have this cage in the silver vein and in the tan. Both are very pretty but the tan color makes it easier to see the birds for some reason. Super easy to clean, seed guard is a must and is awesome.

My green cheek conure loves it!! It came bent.... Instruction were terrible. I had to use the picture on the web site to assemble the cage. The outer guards are badly made. Great cage for my green cheek conure! The cage is very nice and it looks bigger than in the picture. It is more grey than black, but still very attractive. I had mine shipped to me with lots of damages. The cup holders on the play-top were broken off. The cage seed catchers were bent. The poop trays had dents in them. The directions weren't very good; you will need common sense to build this cage. It took me 2 hours to build this cage. Overall, my senegal loves his cage. I just got it today and was easy too put up I love it Very impressed, not hard but does take about an hour to put together. Definitely not complaining!! Very very good construction and absolutely perfect for our spoiled Quaker. Would NOT recommended for a parrot any bigger than a Quaker or multiple Quakers.

The box was packed well with bubble wrap, foam wrap, and corner protectors inside and outside the box. The pack comes with one Allen wrench. The only problem I encountered building the cage was that the paint coating had made some of the screw holes smaller than the screws, making it difficult to screw the screw in. I eventually used a longer Allen wrench to get a greater amount of pressure going to force the screw in. The center divider does not come with a latch to keep it in place so It bounces outwards a bit and must be secured by tieing it in place some how. The biggest fear I have with this cage, is the same as other people have mentioned, the doors! The main doors do not have gaps and little bird toes may get cut off if your bird is attempting to escape while you close the doors. The other issue are the side doors, they are spring loaded and remind me of a mouse trap. I ended up placing a perch on that door so my cleaver boys can't squeeze out the side doors and get clamped. As you can see in my pictures I have a budgie and a cockatiel in one side and an Amazon in the other. The Amazon visits her grandparents on the weekend (this is the cage at her grandparents) and at home she has a MUCH bigger individual cage. That being said, this cage is still a good size for her. She can play and has plenty of room, she mainly just sleeps in this cage and is out all day. For the smaller birds, this cage is a great size and when their sister isn't around the divider can be removed or they can enter the other side through the main doors. WARNING! I bought two of these double cages and had my quakers in them until my bird died because he pushed on the side door of the cage and it closed on his neck. I came home and he was dead.The door has no latch, it just has a spring loaded clip that is not strong enough to stop a small bird from pushing the door open. I was really excited to receive this cage for my two male canaries who resided in two separate cages, one cage with wheels and one Triple Roof Cage that sat on top of our cabinet. It was a pain to clean both cages separately so I thought this one would be a breeze to wheel into the laundry room and clean. Wrong. I just got this assembled today. I bought this with the stand, and the extra cage to stack on top of this set. I didn't buy them for breeding purposes, I just bought them as stackable bird cages. I assembled them myself, both cages and the stand, it took me about 2 and a half hours, and I had no problems with assembly or missing pieces. Everything was there and it went together great! It's very sturdy and it looks really attractive all set up. I don't use the dividers in the cages, I removed the divider and use the full cage. I have a Green Cheek Conure in the bottom one, and a Cockatiel in the top one. There's plenty of space for each bird without the divider. With the divider, the cages are pretty small - I wouldn't feel comfortable keeping anything bigger than a set of Budgies (Parakeets) in the cage with the divider. On the side of each cage there are \"nest box\" access doors on a spring hinge that don't latch (check out the stock pictures) - if you aren't using nest boxes or breeding, you'll want to secure these side doors shut with something (I secured them with screw-on perches inside the cage) because your parrot could push the door open and get stuck when the door snaps shut on him. Anyway, great cages for the price!! The cage itself is very nice. High quality and pleasing to the eye. The assembly on the other hand is horrendous! The very first thing the instructions tell you to do is insert these plastic dow rods into the base to allow for attachment of the cage units on top later. They neglect to tell you that when you insert the dow rods nothing is keeping them from literally sliding all the way down into the base of the leg where it essentially disappears and is of no use. You can shake the leg all you want, poke at it with a screwdriver, and yell obscenities but its not coming back. In addition, the directions are poorly written, and it is difficult to tell which way to turn and attach different panels based on the bare-minimum drawings that were put in as \"aids\". If you attach the panels the wrong way, god help you, because then you have to unscrew probably ~3 pieces to fix the mistake. Some pieces do not fit easily unless the other parts are left loose until the end, however, the instructions do not mention this. So you have to back-track, unscrew pieces, and fight to get new pieces in place. Once it is all assembled it looks great, but the assembly is a nightmare so beware. It was fairly easy to set up. My 13 and 7 year olds and I did it together and I didn\u2019t want to yell at them thru the process of \u2018helping\u2019 me. Directions are pretty clear except that none of the sections are actually labeled. It says attach E to A and you\u2019re there like, ok which one is E? Because there are no stickers on the pieces but the pictures make it easier to work out. I needed a new cage for my two budgies.  One is a rescue and has mobility issues so I wanted a cage with more width than height and the ability to divide the two boys.  This cage is sold by different companies including one I buy their budgie food from but the price was much more than I wanted to spend.  I had looked at cages on Amazon a year ago but this one was not listed so when I checked again I was surprised that the same cage was about $200 less and it included free shipping. I got this cage a month ago. I really like it. I have 2 finches in it without the divider. The cage is very sturdy. It has a support piece across the top (front to back) for added strength. Some measurements:  height with stand, 40 inches. length 37.5 inches. width 18 inches. Height of cage only, 20.5 inches, Front doors (2) are 7 inches (length)  x 9 inches (height). The bar spacing is 0.5 inches. The space above the lower stand shelf to the cage is 12 inches. The nest box side doors are 7 inches (length) x 6 inches (height). They have a tight spring to keep them closed but just in case put a zip tie on them to keep them shut.  I also have zip ties (ones you can open again) on the front doors, since when I take the cage cover off, it tends to flip the latch up. I had to add a small piece of wood to fill in the space along the nest box since the 7 inch length nest door opening was a bit too big. Not a problem.  I put in 2 pieces of cardboard to fill in the small gap at the bottom of the cage since I do not have the divider in. No poo down to my carpet. I can easily slide it out if I put in the divider to clean something with both birds on the other side. The small gap is safe for the birds. I have been using green reptile carpet without the bottom cage grate. I put in a fresh clean piece on each side every day. I have several pieces so I always have a clean and dry one ready to go. The birds can explore at the bottom of the cage without losing things through the grate and it is easier to wash poo off the carpet instead of getting it off the grate. I like that the trays are metal. Also, the seed cups are large for finches, so I put 2 clean and dry sponges at the bottom of the cup with a thin piece of cardboard (from the back of a notebook) over the top sponge. My gouldians finches like the cage too. After being in it for 3 weeks, they laid 6 eggs. We needed another two cages in a hurry to rescue a pair of birds from a bad situation and this was the perfect combination of decent space without being overly bulky. Future expansion possible by adding another pair on top is great for higher density bird lodging. My birds are usually out and about during the day, but these cages are actually fairly roomy, especially if you have the type of birds who don't roam vertically. My rescue quaker and canary-winged parakeet dig their new home- and I'll remove the center divider to let them hang together removes some anxiety for them at times... but it's nice to be able to separate them at times when they get a little squabbly. Been using this cage for a cockatiel for over a year and it is solidly constructed and held up well with no major problems. We use it without the divider for an older cockatiel who doesn't fly much and doesn't need a big cage since he is outside most of the day, but it would be a bit small (height wise) for a younger and more active bird. It is much too small to house two cockatiels for an extended period of time, but it is convenient to stick in the divider and use it as a travel cage for 2. The shorter height is great for fitting the cage into a car without having to disassemble it, which is why we bought it. The front doors hinges are tight, so they don't swing open/closed freely but instead stay open at any angle which is nice and also a good safety feature since our birds like to sit on the top of the door or right in the door frame. ", "We LOVE this cage. We recently and unexpectedly inherited a parakeet upon a loss in the family. Having two parakeets already, we needed a new solution as our current keets are males & the new keet is a female. We wanted them to be able to see each other and interact without worrying about any fights or scuffles. This cage is PERFECT! Great quality and very sturdy. The divider in the middle allows the birds to see and interact with each other very well. It is a great size for parakeets. That being said, I would not be comfortable putting anything any larger than a parakeet or love bird in this cage. But that is my personal preference and experience in owning birds and ensuring they have enough room. Overall, I highly recommend this cage to all small/medium bird owners. Nice quality but Prevue Hendrix has been around for..... I managed a pet store for 12 years and I liked most of their product. This is one I do like. I have two green cheek conures. They should have plenty of room together in this unit. I have removed the divider so they have the entire space. Since they do not normally hang out on the bottom of their current, 3-foot tall cage, this one will be great. It also brings them down from the tree tops to help with their attitudes of dominance. They do seem to enjoy going from side to side and playing with the toys in their tall cage. Again, since the bottom half of the tall cage isn't used, This will be a space saver. The doors are smaller [compared to what they are used too]. But still large enough to allow them to come out as they get outside [the cage] time everyday. I covered the trays with paper - all the way across - so as to cover the space between the trays to help catch seed and debris. The one drawback I realized in putting this cage together - it needs the stand to work the best. It is designed to 'mount' on the stand to use. However, if [my] space allowed, it would work on a table top or a space wide enough to accommodate the design. Well done and worth purchasing again - should I ever need another one! This worked out great for our 2 Sun Conures to sleep in at night or when I have to leave the house. Love this cage(s).  Whether you want one large or two smaller cages, this can work for either using the removable divider that just slides right in or out.  I also purchased this for the storage underneath and the ability to wheel the cage to different areas.  I am not very good as assembling items, but this was so easy and was able to have it together fairly quickly (for me anyway!).  Easy to clean and very easy to get to just about any area of the cage without your birds escaping.  Very sturdy and well made.  Male canaries need to have their own area, so with two males, I needed two cages, but the newest male came with a mated female, so needed to have two cages and the Prevue cage allows two more full cages to be completely attached to the top.  I only needed one for the moment, but this is perfect for my needs and my birds.  They are very happy with this cage and I am happy that it cleans up so quickly and well.  Only wished I would have purchased this a long time ago instead of waiting. Really great cage. It ended up being better than I expected. I'm using it for two small quail and it is a perfect size for them. I love the fact that I can separate the birds when necessary and then allow them to send time together too. Since my quail don't really fly up onto anything I had to stuff the trays with wood chips to keep their feet from falling through the bottom fence part, which thankfully I can take out if it becomes too much of a problem. The food and water dishes are at a perfect height for birds that feed from the bottom of the cage too. The one problem that I can see where a few people have had issues with the trays and the bottom parts of the cage fitting properly. My husband and I both tried to fit the tray and fencing into the track that holds the tray up. What we realized is that both don't fit. The fencing is supposed to go above these tracks while the tray sits in the track. Once we figured that out it made much more sense and fit better than what we were trying to force. I can't say enough good things about this cage. I'm overwhelmingly happy with this purchase and believe it is well worth the price. The cage is pretty sturdy, but poor quality control left a glob of paint in one of the screw holes, so the screw wouldn't fit. I solved the problem, but again, poor quality control. I got this cage for a meyer's parrot, which could open the spring and food doors. I got some small hose clamps and cinched all of the auxiliary doors closed to prevent escape and tragedy--never just assume your bird won't try to escape, prevent your bird from opening the side and food doors by using some closing mechanism. So far so good. I also would suggest buying a couple bowls that bolt on the side, but the bowls that this cage comes with are surprisingly thick and nice. If you plan to use this for a bird slightly bigger than a cockatiel, I would suggest removing the divider and giving him the whole space. I have been wanting to get this cage for a while but didn't have the reasoning to do so. Three cockatiel eggs later, I thought it was about time i seperate my male and female cockatiel. So, I hopped onto amazon and knew exactly which cage I wanted. When taking the product out of the box by myself, I noticed, thankfully, how durable the product was when I accidentally dropped or banged it around during my attempt to pull it out of tightly packaged box, and then while putting it together. It looked like display picture within half hour, though it would take much less time if you have patience to wait for another person to help you.  I had some sibling rivalry going on and was eager to get it put together to separate my growing quail. I bought this to replace the individual bird cages I had before. The quality is very good on this. Assembly was a little confusing, but I figured it out and was able to assemble it by myself. The water/food dishes are perfect. I had such a hard time on my old cages because the dishes would get knocked around/spilled/etc. These stay in place and are so easy to refill. The cage is sturdy and I love the pull out drawers to change the droppings tray. Makes it very easy. The cage itself definitely takes some time to assemble. But its worth the time and money. This cage has a divider in the center that can be removed as needed and allows to effectively turn it in to 2 desperate cages with different pull out floors and separate drop trays. Ive obtained 3 of these cages over time and if i were to get more birds id get another one. The cage comes with a stand if you want it free standing or if you have multiples you can stack the cages on to of one and other. This allows for a great and efficient space usage. I couldn't recommend this cage any more for small birds. It does have a flaw with cleaning. if you leave the divider out for a larger cage for more birds their poop will end up on the rails that the divider usually slides on. Not a huge deal, but its not removable so it makes clearing a touch harder since you must go into the cage to do so. Overall the best cage ive found so far. ", "I bought this cage for a couple \"Special Needs\" Green Cheek Conures, that couldn't be in a tall cage. I needed a sturdy wrought iron one and this fit the bill. Much wider than tall. I can put the divider in, when they get too aggressive with eachother, or take it out if they are getting along well. But I did decide to order a second one, as I feel these are a nice size, with the divider out, for one Conure, but not really sure about two. Very sturdy and actually went together really easy. I did it within an hour and 15 mins. Very nice cage. For the money, this cage should be much more sturdy. It isn't super super flimsy, but I know I could've bought a larger cage that is more sturdy than this one, for less money. This is no \"good deal\" when buying this cage. Solid, well built cage.  Easy assembly.  Good size cage for Conure or smaller birds especially if you take out divider and use it as a single cage.  I bought if for my 2 cockatiels, I like to keep them separate so they still rely on me more, but times when I'm out all day I can easily let them play together in the cage by removing the divider.  Only complaint is the seed cups are way to big for the size birds that would live comfortably in this cage.  My poor little birds looked lost trying to get their heads to the bottom.=)  I ended up using some extra cups from a prevue f050 flight cage I had laying around and they are perfect. They sell them on amazon if you want to switch yours out (Double Plastic Seed Water Feeder Cups by McCage).  This is the 3rd prevue cage I've ordered in 6 months and all have arrived well packaged without damage. The size is great for my two birds (green cheek conure and Cockatiel). They spend most of the day out of the cage, but there is plenty of space for them to eat, play and sleep and they find it to be cozy. The doors are easy to open and lock. The cage is sturdy and easy to clean. The base is also sturdy and provides ample space to store extras. Overall, my birds love their new home, and I love that it doesn\u2019t take up too much space Did not expect such quality for this low price.  It is perfect for my Fife canaries.  Plenty of room which would suit quite a larger bird even.  I definitely made the right choice with this purchase.  My canaries love this cage!  I will be purchasing the same cage without the stand, to stack on top of this one, when my two breed.  I put the cage together by myself & had no problem.  Actually went together fast & was quite easy.  No problem at all with the directions.  Delivery was very fast.  I only delayed to write this so I was sure all functioned well.  I am not experiencing any messy problems either.  Seed hulls mostly remain inside falling to the bottom pull out trays.  Which is very easy to clean. I was given several birds from a person who could no longer keep them.  I ended up with 4 male canaries and 1 female, 1 breeding pair of finches and an offspring.  Long story short, the male canaries began fighting. My parakeets loved this. I found. You Tube where somebody was assembling it. So it was much easier than the instructions. Plenty of room and my two parakeets who fight a lot love it. I pull out the divider so they can play for a little bit and once they start fighting I slip the divider back in and separate them This cage is much smaller than I expected for the price. I can\u2019t fit their baths, or hide out huts through the door. I can\u2019t have both a bath and hide out in there at the same time. I have to take the top off the cage so they can bathe. The divider has no clasps, therefore my two male chinchillas, that don\u2019t get along, slid it open, switched sides and closed it behind them. Yes, it shows they\u2019re smart, but it shows that if you\u2019re wanting to separate a male and female, you need to figure out how to keep the divider in place. For now, I have a screwdriver wedged in it. Very good cage for cockatiels. I was looking for a big cage with a vertical divider that could fit 2 cockatiels and this one is perfect. The pet store charge you per cage when you take your birds to be hosted when you are traveling. This cage is perfect because it can be removed from the stand and it us easy to take to a pet store. It also gives plenty of room for the birds. The customer services is amazing. One of the screws was missing and they sent me a new set of hardware for free. Highly recommended product from a reliable company. I really like this cage. I breed cockatiels and green cheek conures and this cage has the room for a pair. The lock on the doors are great I dont think any bird could open it. I also found out you can buy extra cups from Prevue just call this number 800-243-3624 . It was $6 for the first cup and each additional cup was only $3.82 and that includes shipping. I bought 1 of the Hampton 070 and to of the 075. Was very easy to put together by myself. ", "I got this because I'm contemplating getting a second bird, so I wanted a bigger cage they can (hopefully) share, but it also lets me separate them if not. This arrived on time and my husband put it together pretty quickly. We bought this as a sleeping cage for our gcc, Calypso and Sun, Caoimhe. This is WAY to small for either bird to live in even without the divider. (Which it isn't designed for them anyway.). Anyway, it took them some time to get used to it, but it's perfect for their sleeping habits. I took a star away because a lot of the l hardware was plastic, which we replaced with stainless steel. Bought this for a pair of birds that can't be together in one cage and they seem to really enjoy being right next to each other instead of in different cages. After reading previous reviews, I do think the spring doors could be dangerous if you have a bird that like to explore and is a bit mischievous. I used zip ties to close the spring doors and haven't had any problems. I am so very glad I decided on this cage. The only thing I would change is to have a solid piece for the middle. My birds like to fight a little right now because they are quite hormonal. We fixed this by sliding cardboard in between with the divider. Plus the cardboard gives them something to chew up lol. It was very easy to put this cage together. My 16 yr old did it all by herself. Nice space saving cage. This bird cage is amazing. It\u2019s an awesome color and is very aesthetically pleasing. I love that there is a removable divider to make a big single cage or double. My lovebirds love this thing. It\u2019s just big enough to. They easily removable drawers for cleanup are so great. The storage shelf underneath is a plus as well. It was super easy to install nesting boxes tot he sides as well. The metal is flimsy and even more than I could anticipate. I saw reviews of people using this for medium size birds if you remove the divider. I have conures and ringnecks and I had issues of them bending bars and getting their beaks suck. One of my birds got her beak stuck so badly that I had to cut the wires to get her out. The wires even bend if you try to put simple wood perches in. Not recommended and avoid unless you have really small birds with really light toys. The only reason it got a two star instead of one is because it was easy to put together and clean. UPDATE: DIVIDER WAS PUSHED OPEN BY CREATURES ON ONE SIDE. THAN A FIGHT / BRAWL HAPPENED. MAY HAVE LOST BABIES, sugar gliders injured. I bought two products from Prevue -- a black wrought iron divided flight breeding cage for finches and canneries, as well as a tall white metal flight cage for cockatiels. They arrived in 3 days in exquisitely engineered, perfectly packed boxes with perfectly drawn and precisely written assembly instructions that you barely need because the cages are so fast and easy to assemble, and once you put the last bolt in place, you have one of the strongest, most durable, easiest to clean cages I have ever seen -- and at 71 and being an animal lover the whole time, I have seen a lot of pet and animal care cages. In the global industry of cage making, Preview Products really represents the pinnacle achievement of all mankind, as far as it concerns our responsibility to be a steward of every animal. I thank Prevue, but I'm sure not as much as my birds. You can order from them with perfect confidence. I have three parakeets who used to be housed in the tall blue and white Prevue cage. One is really old, one is \u201cmiddle aged\u201d, and one is only about a year old. The youngest always picked on my elderly bird. I tried separating them but they quickly became depressed from the lack of companionship. This cage is PERFECT! I\u2019m able to let them interact until they start playing too rough, and then I can just slide the little gate in there and they each have their own homes for the night. It\u2019s plenty big enough even when the cage is split. All three seem to be thriving in this cage so far! This is very easy to put together and the direction are clear. Almost everything came in perfect condition except for one part which was really bent and I wasn't able to get the plastic piece in it. Thankfully I was able to bend it back to where it was meant to be and after that it fit perfect. My Parakeets are loving this set up and it makes things look much more organized as well. After putting this together I ended up buying another of these without the stand and they stack up very well. If I keep to Parakeets or the smaller sized birds I will happily buy another of these. ", "The first of the year I finally got both of my Quakers to use one cage after being separate for 11 years.  The one cage was ok but didn't really give them room to move around much.  It is hard to find a cage that is wider than it is tall for birds.  I had looked at this cage a while ago at another site, but went price checking before I made the purchase and I'm glad I did.  I do have Amazon Prime and picked this cage up for $100 less than the other site and free shipping. This cage with the stand is high quality, easy to put together, and the perfect size for having many small birds together in a convenient small space. I'm so glad I bought this because it's way easier to manage and I can keep my parrotlet and budgies in here easily. They have plenty of room. Plus, it just looks very nice. A big bang for you buck! I was truly amazed at the quality and how easy it was to assemble. I didn't buy it for breeding birds, I bought it because I needed to separate my love birds from fighting. I bought other cages but they were too small & flimsy. This product consolidated all my birds in one place. The birds have more space to play and  I have more space to enjoy them! Thank you! It only took my hubby about 30-40mins to put together. Of course, he is used to building and working on things. It is super easy to clean too! I have one budgie. When I want to clean, I just seperate him on one side, while I clean the other, then switch sides. The feeders are really deep, but it decreases the mess because of it. Be careful of the side doors and the feeder doors. A bird could open them and hurt itself or worse. I secured mine with bread ties. It roomy enough for about at max three budgies imo. Love the divider option! We have 2 finches. This cage is great. It's easy to clean with the pull-out pans and we use the divider to clean each half at a time so the birds don't get out. Really happy with this cage. It was more than I wanted to spend but read that finches need to fly horizontally. I think they are really happy in their new home! They actually chirp and sing now. I bit of a pain to put together, my 9 year old son helped me. I kept Baby Quakers in this and it worked perfectly for that. The storage space on the bottom on the cage was also very helpful. This is very much a cage for babies or very very small birds. The opening was tiny and the baby Quakers were able to sneak out the opening for the breeder box once they were able to fly This cage is great for my parakeets! I had no problems with set up. The instructions we easy to follow. I wish the bottom storage shelf was a little stronger, but that's the only reason for a 4 star! I used zip ties to secure the breeder doors & also put some around the divider to make it more secure, as it was a little wobbly on its own. I also added cardboard to help keep the seed inside, i hope. LOL I got this cage from the Amazon warehouse and it is the nicest cage ever. I can even separate them when they need a break from one another. Sturdy as hell too. My budgies can fly around in it instead of being cramped up in their old smaller cage. We love it and so do our feathered friends. I've seen a few posts saying this cage was hard to put together, that the holes did not align for the screws, etc. Fortunately, I bought and assembled 4 and didn't have a problem with any of them. The first took a little time to figure out but after that the other 3 were a breeze. I really like the look and functionality of these cages. I agree with one of the other posts saying that it would be nice to have a solid divider in the case that you don't want birds to see each other, but I found some white wallboard at Home Depot that was easy to cut and serves this purpose nicely. The ONLY reason I am not giving this cage a perfect 5 stars is that the spring on one side of one of my 4 cages was cut just a bit short so that door doesn't close all the way. It is really a very minor detail and easy for me to resolve with a clip tie, but if it's not perfect it's not perfect. Still, pretty close! ", "I have a bird with 1 eye and he cannot be housed with my other bird. Vet says even if they're friends, this weakness could cause my other bird to attack him out of instinct. Not gonna test that theory so I got this cage. This cage works well since they can still communicate. They spend hours a day our of their cage so the size is fine for 2 cockatiels. If they were going to spend most of their time in their cage this would be too small. I have had finches for 15 years & they have always had housing that needed intensive care!  This cage is the answer to my problems.  I now separate my finches (male only & female only) because I don't want more babies.  This cage works really well for me!!!  Thank you Amazon!!!!! After I bought this....I went and got another one.  Love it.  I put my baby chicks in it when they are in the fuzz stage.  I have quails in it now.  Easy to clean, looks really nice and nicely made.  NOT CHEAPLY MADE, thankfully.  Totally worth it. Great cage for the value, size and sturdiness. Only complaint would be the cleaning trays is a big snug with the \u201cdrawers\u201d and the safety/security latches on them. That may just be my opinion or related to how I assembled but it\u2019s a minor note and I would still highly advise purchasing this cage for your bird(s) if this is suitable/fitting your need. This breeding cage is just about right for my Parrotket brothers that cannot be housed in the same cage. The instructions were kind of difficult the pieces are named on the sheet and not on the pieces. The only problem is the bottom wire and pull out drawer do not fit into the slot I know had to force them. My parrotlets are babies so phase the bottom covered and do not need to use the pull out drawer yet. I guess I will be able to force the slide wider so that the wire and drawer fit. And of course these were the last pieces to go in, so I will not be dismantling and returning the item. That is the only reason I knocked off stars. We love this bird cage and was really surprised at the quality. It was fairly easy to assemble and has so much more room than we thought it would. We use it without the divider and it is really roomy for our 2 doves. They do get out of the cage often so aren't completely confined to this cage but when they are in it they have plenty of room and seem happy in it. This cage is overall a great cage. We bought this for our sun Conure and it's a good size for her. I was a bit disappointed in the size, but I'm not docking any stars for that because the description clearly states what the dimensions are. It was very easy to assemble. It took my boyfriend and I about 30 minutes to get it put together. If it were one person, I'd estimate an hour. Good quality for the price. I love the door latches on this cage. The wheels are a huge plus as we move the cage often for cleaning and bed time. Overall, an excellent product with a great price! So far we are loving this cage! It was super easy to assemble and looks like it will be easy to clean from past experiences. Wire age is definitely thin so I would only recommend for small Conures and like birds or smaller. May come back to review if anything changes:) I would not use this cage for and hook billed birds, it is intended for small birds as per the description. I use my cages stacked for parrotlets, I have a pair per cage. I only divide the cage if my males get aggressive to the chicks in the nest boxes. I have conures and would never put them in one of these cages, as far as ringnecks absolutely not in this cage. please understand anyone who is looking to buy this type of cage, use it for Finches, canaries, and Parakeets, and Parrotlets. The bar spacing is 1/2\" but the wire gauge is small so  any hook billed bird bigger than a parrotlet will bend the bars and will only injure its self. I like the cages the go together easily and look good. I do not like the spring loaded nest box door. I use nest boxes on my cages but if you don't be careful and if you put a larger bird in the cage it my injure itself on it.. For me they work well. I hope this helps. great cage for the price. ", "My two canaries love it and I like it too. Good quality and easy to clean, and roomy, with the option to have the birds together or separate. I might buy one more, no stand and install it on top, at a later time. I\u2019ve heard that they can be stacked. Very sturdy and great quality! Pricy but worthwhile. Comes with the stand as well. Wish there were optional cages available to stack! The Canary cage comes in parts, no surprise there.  However, it would be ideal if the parts actually lined up to the holes for the screws.  Two parts involving the tray appear to be transposed.  Therefore the screw holes are not in the right spot.  My husband is a milwright and can fortunately drill holes in the metal.  However, anyone without such resources might want to look at another model. Great quality.  Didn\u2019t like feeders though.  Huge.  I bought it for parrotlets and there is plenty of space.  I wish they would add a solid acrylic or plastic divider.  So birds would not be able to bite each other.  And as far as side doors, I had to cut one off to install a breeding box. And on the other side ziptied it shut. The cage is well built, for the price, and works well for small parrot type birds.  I currently have two Pacific Parrotlets in the cage.  It's higher up than other version they make.  For the ability to keep several birds in a small space this cage has no equal, but should only be used when the birds are let out during the day.  The space is adequate for 24 hour use, but I prefer when to let the birds out during the day and using the cage for their food presentation and sleep. Quality.  All parts fit well. Not difficult to assemble.  Good powder coating. Nice latch. Not too high.  so the cats can't try to knock it over! I really like how space efficient this cage is. It's very sturdy, and the shelf for storage is so handy. Absolutely PERFECT!!!  Great quality and easy instructions -- which made assembly very, very easy for this 71 year old widow !!!  One of the top (middle) stabilizing bars I had to drill the hole for the large screw just a tad bigger,but no problem at all  -- love having the stand, too!  Worth every penny and very fast delivery! Well built!! Moves easily on sturdy stand! Currently using it for flight cage for young canaries\u2014roomy for three birds! Sad to put 2 stars, I love the cage for my breeders, but there's just 1 problem, or 2. The breeding box is just too high! I been breeding for years and this was my first time with this cage. Had 5 healthy babies hatch in it, when they climbed out to the cage part, 3 fell and hurt their legs, I am now working on 2 of babies legs to strengthen as one had passed away from the injury yesterday.  The opening to place the box is way too high so I had to buy a playform for under the hole, just in case. ", "I was not super impressed soon as I put it together and that was not hard at all very easy did it myself ! A bit smaller then intended but mostly to short to the ground could use another ft added on or more but the cage is sturdy It is great , i love it. It seems like its made from good materials. One review mention that a bird could get caught in the side nesting doors. I personal feel like unless you have a bigger bird it definitely cant open in, it takes way to much force. with that being said i did zip tie them down to be sure , just in case. Also you might have issues with your birds pooping into the food/water bowls ( they are located under ever perch) so i cant use to the iner ones , witch is fine idc Cage is well made and functional. It was just way smaller and shorter than expected. Putting it together was a pain, the instructions could have been better. This is defiantly for small birds! I ended up buying a bigger cage not long after buying this one Love it! I dont use it as a breeding cage, just as a \"condo\" for my male birds and they love it. They have both become so happy having each other close by. The cage itself is sturdy and nice. I love it, taking it apart to clean or change toys/perches is super easy! I bought it so that I can divide my lovebirds when needed, but also to give them more room.  I've always thought it was useless to have tall skinny cages when the birds just sit up at the top.  They need space side to side so they can move around and fly a bit. I'm very disappointed I didn't see that the price was $30 cheaper at Walmart online.  I should have bought it there.  It is a very nice cage and fits my needs perfectly so other than the price, I am pleased with the cage.  I breed Green-cheek conures and these are great cages for breeding birds of this size. We originally purchased this for our pet rodent who is fearful of anyone that is not her parents.  She can get territorial if a stranger reaches inside her home.  This is PERFECT, as it makes it\u2019s so easy and safe for our sitter to get into the cage, change food/litter box, clean up, etc. while keeping our pet safely out of reach.  More easy to assemble than our previous Prevue cages, sturdy, lots of room.  I used small clips to keep the food dish windows locked. I use it for my two doves, who do not fly. Not large enough for a flight cage, but good for birds who mainly sit, anyhow. I had the wire stackable cages and they were hard to clean with no removal grill or grate and too flimsy for wood nesting boxes. These are strong, durable, easy to clean with a lock to hold the grate and tray from sliding forward. I love them and my birds are happy. Awesome cage! Easy assembly and clear instructions. Love their assembling tips. Perfect size and seems very sturdy. Love the stackable feature. Loved it so much, will replace all my cages with this one. ", "Love the cage and how easy it was to put together it\u2019s a great space saver and still gives them plenty of room to move around. My only problem was the package was in pretty bad shape and some of the cage parts was sorta bent had to straighten them out but other than that the cage is great. This cage is perfect for my 4 rats! I love that I can separate my males and females and there is lots of room for them to run around and play! The pull out tray is also a great feature for easy cleanup! The quality is excellent! I\u2019m so happy with this purchase! Very easy to put together.  Well built product.  The only thing I didn't like is one door is slightly bent so it doesn't open and close very easy and I'm constantly spilling the water trying to shut the door. This is an excellent home for your birds. I am using it for my diamond doves who have just started breeding. They use the top of the cage as a place to relax and eat treats. The bottom shelf has their food and other supplies on it.  Its a fantastic price compared to other vendors.  I would highly recommend this product. Very nice cages. I have 2 of them. Don\u2019t like the dishes so use small ceramic dishes instead. Well made. I have  a pair of Gouldian Finches in each cage. It took a while for me to put it together and I wish i could find a decent seed card, the sides on the bottom dont help. Arrived well packaged. I put it together myself in about an hour. Replaced two cages for lovebirds that don't always get along. Solid cage for the money! Despite me knowing it wasn't big enough for my conures, I let my mother convince me to get this for them. I ended up returning it. However, it is a great cage that I would highly recommend for smaller birds. It is sturdy and was easy to set up. I would take heed of other's warnings and zip tie those spring doors though. An absolutely wonderful solution for my two pairs of lovebirds! It's so nice to have just one cage taking up space, and my little birds are very content. The two pairs have always been together but in separate cages and they really like being right next to each other! And the cage is sturdy enough to stand up to my three curious cats, who like to lie on it to look out the window. I have these for my parakeets (budgies) and I have no complaints. Neither do the birds. There\u2019s lots of room and they like the wide size. All the moving parts of the cage work perfectly. The casters roll smoothly and it makes it really easy to move the cage for vacuuming. My only complaint would be that if you screw a screw in too hard, it grinds out the middle really easily. I wish they sold spares. ", "We have an eclectus parrot and a rose breasted cockatoo and wanted this cage to be able to take them camping. Unfortunately the delivery was after we left and we had to board them. It's a perfect cage the stand comes off too for traveling.  Now my birds are going to be safe inside and out and taking lots of trailer camping trips. I resently bought 2 Diamond Doves.  I wanted a cage that would keep them safe from my cats, and able to move to different rooms.  This cage is worth every penny.  It's sturdy.  Easy to move around.  I didn't use the divider, it's one open cage.  Knowing my new Doves are safe from my cats makes this cage perfect.  The directions could be better.  I managed to assemble in about an hour. Really nice double cage, sturdy and easy to assemble, but had too return.  It was too small for the two birds I wanted to use it for. If you have small birds...  I gave English Budgies this cage is Excellant!!! Very well made and easy to assemble Perfect. Just what needed for 2 pairs of breeding conures. Love the extra door on the side so that you put the nesting box on the outside. Love the shelf too Pretty sturdy, pretty easy to assemble, came in good condition and the bowls are huge, I used this cage for my 2 lovebirds that were in a small breeding cage and wanted a cage that wasn\u2019t to big. I\u2019m just a little concerned with the nest doors as it\u2019s kind of hard to attach nesting boxes to them, but overall I loved the cage and so did my lovebirds too :) Love product for my parakeets I really wanted to like this cage but it was already rusted a little in a spot and now the rust has spread in cracks I can not reach. Be sure to read and count all parts..  There are some parts that are difficult to assemble.  For example there are some triangle parts that should fit the lower tray.  It would help if there is a 800 number to ask questions. ", "Nice spacious cage for my finches. It was easy to put together. The stand is way too short, but for now I put it on bed risers and it\u2019s much better. I zip tied the  breeder doors closed and feel that it\u2019s otherwise very safe and sturdy. The height of this cage was miss leading, couldn't use it Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  The birds do too!  Have all the amenities that make caring for my birds convenient.  Even a friend who owns a pet shop commented on what a nice cage it is. Very well thought out. Good product but a little expensive I love this stacker cage.  Fellow friend ended up buying 2 with a second tier also for them. Pipp and Squeek love their new cage as do we. Easy to put togeather and beautiful. The bottom pans and floor are easy to remove for cleaning. I have 2 parrots that were not getting along and this cage worked out prefect!!! This cage is absolutely amazing!! It\u2019s super easy to put together. You can use it as one big cage or divide it so it becomes to cages. My birds absolutely love it!! You can choose to use the roller stand or build it without the stand!! I extremely recommend this cage is you\u2019re considering buying it!! 10 \" between bottom storage tray and first row of cages.  2 nd stack can be purchased seperately and easily added .  Few extra quick ties and it stays together nicely. Great cage for small parrots such as lovebirds , tiels but sun conures can bend wire if they consistently fool with it.  Great cage for price.and free shipping! The main door latch is nice. Breeder door off side. Overall decent for price. ", "Amazing bang for your buck..  I\u2019ve House 6 canaries in this cage and they all have plenty of room to fly around in..  great cage, very sturdy and easy to assemble. This cage is hard to put together. Some of the screws didn't fit easily but the instructions were pretty detailed. Finally after it was together it was really nice. Well worth the money. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This cage works very well for my QUAIL. Just received cage today, looks like just what we are looking for.  However it is missing one of the plastic connector pieces, I think we can work around it but would love to have the correct piece. Awful cage holes don't meet up on cage to even fully putt together in four places an I needed the cage fast for my rats an couldn't even use it . Love this cage.  It provides separation for my birds yet is just like being together.  It is also so easy to clean, unlike my previous cage. Sturdy, my birds love it. Great for introducing birds together. Perfect size. Easy assembly. Great quality. This cage is worth every penny! It so easy to put together and the finish product is excellent. It has a storage on the bottom and made very well. This is a great cage. I have 2 handicapped birds and this has enough room for each of them. It is sturdy and very well made. Plus it came with instructions on putting it together and a 90 day warranty. I wish I would have had these when I had my 42 cockatiels. Best EVER! Easy for 2 people to assemble quickly. ", "Good price and quality Great for rabbits too! I bought this and the second story cage to stack my birds. They put together easily and seem well made so far. I pull the partition out to allow my larger birds more room. Great for my birds who prefer to be direct neighbors, but not roommates. Saves me space over other cage options in apartment. Great cage for 4 parakeets Easy assembly, and I so happy that the trays are also made out of metal. Easy to clean. I have a parakeet on one side and a cockatiel on the other. They have plenty of room. The stand on wheels will make my life so much easier, with cleaning and being able to wheel them outside on a nice day, instead of having to carry their cages. Works perfect for my two parrotlets to be side by side and quite happy. Sturdy construction, and the openings have an extra safety measure so I don't have to worry about my cats finding a way to tamper with it. Fast shipping, exactly as described, Love em Beautiful. They enjoy it very much. Easy assembly. Packaged extremely well, corners reinforced to prevent damage during shipping. Highly recommend this item and seller I like it ", "the 2 sides of the cage have 4 screws on each side, 2 on top and 2 on bottom..  the 4 screws for the top I couldn't put them in cuz they forgot to thread the holes so I had to use zip ties to hold both top sides. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  The cage and the stand was easy to put together, the quality is even better than I expected. I have a sun Conur and a green cheek conure And I use this set up as their outdoor cages with good performance This cage provides my birds with a safe and comfortable home while looking nice and being easy to move around as needed. I have two cages with one stacked above the other. Very good product I would buy again Second cage I've bought from them, great quality. Very sturdy and the finish is very nice.  It was pretty easy to put together, rolls well and seems like it will be easy to clean .  The dishes are also nice and big.  I would say it would work really well for conures or smaller.  I have cockatiels and I would say that using it divided it would be to small but without  the divider it works for up to two birds.  I am planning on buying the top section to add on. Sturdy, good size. Ziptie the nest doors! I keep budgies and tiels. Great for our two conjures when fighting. They are let out during day. Only sleep in at night. Fantastic cage.  Houses a pair of Parrotlets - the hen is very aggressive - did add a Plexi glass divider to protect the males toes.  Very easy to assemble.  Arrived with damaged top and front panels but the company replaced them immediately. Very satisfied with this purchase. ", "we use them for our quail and they love their \"friendy cages!\" Very nice cage. Easy to clean. Rolls on wheels. Ordered this cage to house some finches in.  Perfect in every way.  Great quality at a fair price and shipping was super fast.  Thanks for listing this item.  Again, PERFECT! I just bought it and the screws won't fit into this piece. I have to tie them together for it to come together. I may change my review if I get a replacement piece but this is really bothersome. I truly recommend this cage for bird lovers. Great cage and love that I can separate my canaries if they bicker with each other.  Great flight cage. Received product and built the cage in an hour easily!! My two finches, Sonny and Cher are very pleased. They came gifted in a very small cage. I would order this again and again! Sweet cage Product is nice but directions could be a little bit better but is it is a wonderful bird cage large food cups wonderful nice cage for the price Very nice cage. I use it as a flight cage for 2 Ringneck Doves....they love it. The extra large sheer guard cage skirt works well and fits this cage perfectly. I would purchase this cage again. ", "I absolutely love this cage I have three budgie in it and they have so much room I got this because I have a parakeet and a love bird and they do NOT get along together in one cage. Two cages took up way too much room, so, I purchased this cage.  It was delivered on time, was easy to put together and my birds are very happy with their new space. Very pleased and would recommend it to anyone, 2 sets of parakeets Sturdy This is a perfect flight cage. I love how you can make two separate cages or one big cage just by sliding in/out the divider. Great idea for it being on wheels, easy movement! Love this cage. Was a bit harder to put together but I did get it. Instructions were a bit unclear but if you take your time you will get it. Very sturdy and well made. Perfect for what I needed it for. I needed a sturdy cage that my cats couldn't get into and I saw the review from one customer who had the same problem. He was right. They cannot get into this one. I zip tied the easy open doors and only use the door with the latch on it. I do wish it was a little bit taller but I can work with this. My birds seem to be satisfied with the size and shape of the cage and it is way easier to clean than their previous cages. I love the cage. It is sturdy, with enough room for several small birds like finches. Lots of room for a cockatiel size bird to spread its wings but would need to be let out of the cage daily to fly around. Great cage, has divider. Miltiple openings. Strong hinges. Would not buy any other now. Very functional I can finally put my Love Birds together.  They love this cage and if they decide to bicker, I just slide the divider in and they play well by themselves. ", "perfect for combining cages Good quality cages for a great price. Sturdy construction.  Look nice. Your finch bird will enjoy definitely Nicely made. All pieces included. Went together just fine. Great design. Shipping box could have been sturdier. Would recommend.

The cages aren't too small.  Very sturdy, I absolutely love this cage! I ended up buying another. Very sturdy! Had to have this item by a certain time frame. Came with the side peices two large for the cage. I know for a fact they are two large as I ordered two of these cages and compared to the other. Hey dissapointed ", "Added this to combine with previous cage.  Easy addition and wheels make it easy to move ... I like  the cage but shipping is easily get damage...now I'm so lazy take it apart and return it...so buy it with your own risk Love the cage. Great for breeding small birds. Put together by myself in a hour Great cage.  Very heavy duty It's short but I do love This! Cage has potential, but right door latch missing screw and one of the cage screws doesn't tighten. Hole is either too big or stripped. A few holes weren\u2019t fully drilled out I am missing parts c2 -c6 This cage is pretty decent I got it for my two breeding pairs of gouldian finches. This is an awesome cage.  It is well made and the bars are powder coated wrought iron.  It is easy to clean.  The birds seem very happy in this cage.

Nice finish and the pans are metal not plastic. Amazing cage! And super easy to assemble! Perfect for 2 parakeets! At first I thought this was exactly what I was looking for.I wanted to house two pairs of parakeets near each other and this seemed like the perfect space saver. And to be fair, the cage is fairly well constructed and sturdy.It wasn't too hard to assemble and it looks nice enough. Good cage. Solid. Easy to put together. No complaints honestly. Tiene muy buen tama\u00f1ano. Tengo 2 cotorros y el espacio es muy bueno para cada uno. Gracias None Nothing bad to say Like I said, besides the nest doors being too big, they are great! ", "Made well and works well. My parrotlets seem happy in it Great item and easy to use A really nice cage for the money.  Read the assembly instructions carefully; it took me a while, but I did it.It went together nicely. Awesome! Birds very happy in their new home! Spot on The cage is good but seems short. It is kind of uncomfortable to feed the birds in such a low position.  Is the there any way to make it taller? Excellent product very good material perfect for breeding canaries great cage a bit tricky to set up but my birds love it. goo quality. Love it! Easy to assemble, great price and high quality product. My birds are happy! ", "Should be a 5 star review but 3 bolts were missing, very disappointed. Aside from that it's a beautiful cage and canary approved. Thank u. Its perfect I like it and how it looks in my home Great big bird cage... perfect condition At first we thought it wouldn't be tall enough for our two bourkes, but they have no problem.  They spend a lot of time out of their cage, so they use this to eat and sleep in and a place to go an rest.  All in all it was a great pruchase. Excellent 4 canaries Very disappointed, door to small and to many places a bird can catch their toes in Nice product very sturdy... Easy to use large feed bowls, very easy to clean.. I use it as a breeder cage and it works out well! Excellent length for horizontal flight ", "This is really sturdy and well made. Very nice bird cage. Prevue quality. Excellent cage.  Easy to build. We'll constructed.  My birds are siblings.  When they are getting along I open up the center divider and when they are bothering each other I close the divider.  Couldn't be happier. Love it! On time and great!!! This is a very nice cage system. I also got the top cages. I have 4 cages in one system.  Great price great quality. This is a great product! I bought this for my single dove. I have previously bought prevue hendrix bird cages before and been very impressed by the quality for the price, and this was the only cage I could find that was wide and short rather than tall and skinny (a wider cage is better for a dove as they tend to hop around rather than fly). Good cage for price Met our needs perfectly. Great cage and was shipped quickly. My birds like New cage'' ", "Love the cage To me, F070 is completely perfect for what I need. The size of the case is just right for medium parakeet, sturdy, easy assembly. It looks nice. I am happy to choose this product. My birds will be happy for new home too. Good product . I just wander how to make it taller . Fairly easy to assemble and great quality!  It has lots of room for birds and smaller creatures. Can't be beat for the price! This cage is awesome. Our finches can finally fly length ways instead of height ways. I think this cage is a great place for them our finches to live in. Grate item Very well built - lots of ways to get into the cage - easy cleaning. I have cockatiels and this cage is perfect for them. Exactly what I was looking for. Great cage! Good for separating my cockatiel and ringneck! ", "Very well made cage! I am very disappointed in this cage. It is flimsy wire and the grate on the bottom of the cage gets stuck and hard to remove to clean. The divider is where the birds can bite each others toes and I was afraid one would hurt the other one. There needs to be double wire between the two cages where they can see each other, but not be able to reach each other's feet. I hate this cage. Easy to assemble. Exactly what it says they are. nice Love this cage easy to. Assemble love it Great Buy. LOVE this bird cage wish I would have bought it sooner.  Fast shipping It is missing one of the sliding front doors Best cage ever Nice Just what I was looking for. I now have 3 birds consolidated into 1 setup.  I got 2 of them and stacked them. It's so much better then having 3 separate cages. Great idea just wish I seen them before I bought the three separate cages. But now I have travel cages for my birds. ", "Pappa tiel, in double bottom condo with daughter and husband, moved up to single condo with handicapped lady tiel. and other tiel in other condo still likes to stay with him friend, a conure in his house. Other than that, I think all tiels are happy with their new home. Lady Tiel seems to like having company also. This bird cage is great...just as advertised!  Made everyone happy.  The only thing that was unexpected was how fast and easy it was to assemble-despite the reviews we read that it would take 3-4 hours.  Simply not true.  Took about an hour.  It was no sweat to assemble with English instructions. great cage for the price, quite a bit cheaper than other retailers. I received the bird cage with only three wheels, not four. 2 small 4 anything but finches, keets, parrotletts... unless u don't plan on using the divider I bought this to use as a breeding cage for my Green Cheek Conures.  I bought the F075 cage to put on top of this one to make a stack of two.  I have one pair of birds per cage with the dividers removed.  I found the cage to be well constructed and of good quality...much more so than I expected for a cage that costs this little.  All pieces are powder coated and I love the suspended tray design of this cage, which makes it very difficult for the birds to push the trays out. Although like the other reviews I read before the purchase, it was a challenge for my husband to assemble but he agrees, so worth it. It is attractive and very functional. It is HUGE, and the design gives my zebra finches great lengthwise flight that they love.  Since my birds are a small breed, he made some easy modifications. He pulled out the divider in the middle for full flight range. Since this gives a gap, he pulled out the rubber trays under the floor and removed two of the loose racks. He attached the racks to the gap in the middle with black zip ties (not even noticeable) and he replaced the rubber trays. Across the top, he wrapped some PVC pipe with black electrical tape and attached that with zip ties.  I purchased 4 gauze bird seed catchers and sewed them together and attached the two ends with lightweight velcro. I purchased some covered baskets from Ross for all my bird supplies. It truly is and efficient set up. My mated pair had a nest and a clutch of 5 birds. All 7 zebra finches are happy and have plenty of room. I bought one more bird so there was an even number of birds. It is a harmonious group and a joyful hobby. Great breeder cage. We got this for two foster budgies who were in too small a cage and often fight.  We figured we can use the removable divider to put them in separate timeout without traumatizing them by removing them from each other entirely.  It is extremely solid and stable, the configuration is convenient, and we love that it is on wheels which makes moving an awkwardly large heavier cage much easier.  We wish it were just a bit taller - as is the budgies when in the top corner are at about our chest height when we're sitting in the chair by them.  It would also be nice if the access doors were a little larger.  But for the money it is a very durable value and the ability to reconfigure it to separate cages is really nice. I have two parakeets who were in a large Vision brand cage.  The female seemed to bicker with the male quite often. I purchased this cage because it has the ability to easily separate the birds if there is fighting.  For the first few days I kept the birds apart with the divider in the middle. After that, I took the divider out and believe it or not, the female bird didn't fight anymore!  I think this is in part due to the horizontal size of the cage.  There is plenty of room for the birds to move back and forth and even fly. The cage is sturdy and good quality.  I have no real complaints and would recommend this cage to anyone looking for a good sized cage that parakeets can live happily in.  The cage is easy to clean since the bottoms slide right out.  My only complaint is that the food dishes are way too deep.  You have to put quite a bit of seed in them, at least I did for my birds to feel comfortable when eating.  To remedy it, I place a more shallow food dish in between the two the cage comes with.  Also, unlike the Vision brand cages, these don't have a seed catcher built in so I'd recommend La Feber's nutri-berries as the seeds are already hulled and the birds won't make a mess with them.  Again, I love the cage. ", "Love the cage portion. Easy to clean. I bought this cage so I could roll my birds outside onto my deck on nice days. Unfortunately the legs are made of hollow aluminum and break off rendering it useless in 18 months. The threads inside the cage frame were painted and the screws were hard to get in ( about 4 of them ) had to force them in. The trays that have to be emptied & cleaned are very hard to put in and take out , my husband had to force the trays in while assembling & could barely take it out. Other than that I love the design & the sturdiness. I bought this cage for breeding pairs who need to be seperated in the off-season. It worked well for that purpose, until it began rusting. Also, cleaning it is a major chore. There's a bunch of nooks and crannies that are impossible to get. You have to disassemble it in order to really get it clean. Don't use a power-washer because it will lift the powder-coating right off. I bought two of these for stacking with stand and it is great for my Gouldians.  They have enough room and can make good breeder cages also. The quality is very good and move them in and outside daily and they hold up to that routine rolling smoothly without disturbing the birds. Great cage, I have used it for my finches and Parrotlet, it is also very roomy and is easy to clean! Great value. Overall quality is good. Birds love it. great! really easy to assemble only down fall is that the sticks were to small for the cage so i had to go buy some perches for my birds Bought this to introduce my new Conure to my existing Conure. You have to put it together but the instructions were easy to understand. It took me about an hour. Would be easier for two people. Good quality cage though. Great price.

All accessories are well designed and functional. Assembly was straight forward especially with the instructions that were provided. Arrived very well without any broken part.  One negative issue was that a metal bars on the side wire grill was missing. Its the one that attaches to the L-shaped corner (for the M02 model) or to the base of of the cage (if you want to use the M02 as a shorter model). I am afraid that its not stable enough like this.Will contact them. I hope they send me a new side grill. Will update my review after some time. This is a second bird cage that we ordered from Vision. I cannot imagine a better home for my birdies! It's cool looking, easy to clean, mess free, made with good materials. A very well designed and constructed cage! The assembly instruction is good but in general, it was pretty easy to assemble with minimal brain power. This cage is a lot bigger in real life! It is perfect for my 4 parakeets. The clear plastic lower panel really help contains the messes! The two double doors really provide versatility and large access. You can access the perches and feeding bowls with out reaching inside the cage and freaking out your birds! Cleaning is pretty easy but you do have to lift the entire cage off its tray-like base then make sure your bird don't try to make an escape. At less than $70, you can't go wrong! I love this cage! It's really much bigger than I even anticipated. It fits my 2 parakeets just wonderfully. A lot of people complained about the directions on building it but I found no problem. I really hope if you are considering getting a cage, get one of these. I am very happy I bought this birdcage!  I looked at many different kinds and decided to take a chance on this one.  I am so glad!  It has many nice features and it actually does keep the seeds and mess within the cage.  I also love that the doors latch securely, and the way they are made, my birds can not get them open.  With my other cage I had to put alligator clips on any openings because I have a very curious and inventive parakeet.  Now I do not have to do this.  I also never have to clip food and water dishes now because the bird removes the covers.  There simply aren't any and the mess is contained within the bottom of the cage quite nicely.  I was a little worried about the odd plastic perches, but my birds seem to have no problems with them... even my little one that has one leg that was broken in the past. The first time I ordered a Vision cage for my two parakeets I bought a horizontal medium. It arrived damaged...the plastic base was cracked from the bottom up. I returned it and had no problem at all with my return. Our Vision bird cage, model M02 (medium tall) arrived yesterday, the primary retail container nested securely inside a plain brown shipping carton. I happened to get this cage at a great daily deal just after Christmas and thought I'd try it for my parrotlet.  LOVE this cage!  Was a little difficult for me to assemble but it's probably completely user error (I'm terrible at reading directions properly).  It is very large and spacious for my little guy!  Wish I could have gotten the long version since it's a little difficult for my guy to fly inside.  I love the double doors that open in and out and the fact that the bottom feeders keep the mess inside the cage.  The feed dishes come with little shields to put over them and I haven't had to deal with any waste landing in the food/water.  You have to wipe off the shields but that's way better than seed and water scattered everywhere.  It's a little too small for two parrotlets but I was able to stack a small flight cage on top, connect it with a rope to climb and they play in between the two cages when the doors are open. I finally received my Vision Bird Cage Model M02 - Medium very late last night because of a bad snowstorm in our area. Pulled the cage out of the box this morning, and got it set up. It was not an easy setup, there were many clips and fasteners to put it together, and all in all it took about 3 hours to complete it. But when I put my little canary into the cage, he was so happy! His previous cage was small and not nice at all, and he was flying around the new cage in no time, and obviously enjoying himself. One thing I liked about the cage was the flaps that you could hang over the seed and water bowls, to keep other stuff ending up in the bowls. I also liked the double decker design of the front cage entrances. Despite the amount of work it took, it was well worth the money. I've owned many bird cages  and this one is hands down the best.  Easy to assemble (and I'm not adept at assembly, so much appreciated).  I'll add pics later, but what I most want to share is the fact that I bought the kit that lets you stack two cages, and adjoined two tall ones to make a super-tall cage:\u00a0 ", "Pro. Would buy this item again. Quick and easy to assemble with the help of teenage son and twenty-something niece. Some of the pictures in the instructions were confusing, you have to be very visually observant, but working together we got there in the end. The design seemed fragile, but once fully assembled it was fairly sturdy. The design helps reduce the amount of feathers & debris getting outside the cage. Note there is no handle on the top of the cage so you have to lift from the sides. Cage bottom is a little fragile and a bit awkward to clean. You unfasten the side clips and lift the entire top (with the acrylic bottom skirt attached) onto a prepared papered space. Don't lift it too high or the birds may fly out. (Experience talking there.) After that it's pretty easy to clean out the white base pan. The green plastic accessories are very easy to wash clean. With the cage cleaning, just be careful, be gentle, move slowly, and you won't have a problem. This is worth the effort and a very nice habitat for parakeets. If you do break something, I've noticed replacement pieces are available for separate purchase online. Sidenote: The wire doors can swing in or out, the acrylic doors swing out and have to be fully open to remove the green feeder & waterer dishes. The wires are horizontal compared to vertical for most traditional cages, so some accessories (such as my old waterer) won't work, although I did finally get my old waterer to wedge between the vertical edges of two corner panels. So the cage is great. It's big, it is well designed so far as quality, and it looks nice. I just have 3 issues with it. The food and water bowls being on the bottom, though it may sound nice in theory, in reality falls a little short. For this, I would not have taken a star, since it is as advertised and does work as intended. We do not get water or bird food outside of the cage anymore. Though, I do not like that I have to stick my hand inside the cage to remove the bowls either. For most birds this would be alright but ours that we adopted is aggressive towards hands in or near her cage. So our cage arrived in less than a week, much larger than expected, and well made, which was a pleasant surprise!! ...We assembled this beauty in approx 30 minutes, by following the diagrams on the instruction sheet, and of course using some common sense... This birdcage is a nightmare.  First of all, I believe I have the wrong model - the one I got is not nearly as tall as the picture would appear it would be.  Secondly, the instructions say that the cage can be put together in \"5 - 10 minutes\"  - that's a load of hooey.  I worked on this cage for two hours and still couldn't get it together correctly, possibly because the instructions are absolutely horrible.  The graphics are not very informative, and the written instructions are almost nonexistent.  I ended up using zip ties to get the top to stay on the cage!  Ridiculous.  And there is nowhere to grasp the cage from the top to move it easily for cleaning or anything else - like using it for a temporary home when I board my bird.  Zip ties to the rescue again. Also, there was an extremely sharp metal point on one of the door corners that sliced my arm open in two places while I was trying to get this mess put together.  I am not usually so critical of things, but this is one purchase I wish I had NEVER made. It's a beautiful cage. My parrotlet Dim Sum loves all the room. I purchased him with a curled toe on his right foot and the horizontal bars make it easier for him to navigate his space. For a full year we have had this cage with 5 healthy budgerigars in it. It took me longer to put this thing together than it my 5' 110 lb. parrot cage (which would normally require two people.)  Nothing \"snapped\" together.  The wire cage part does not seat well into the bottom.  I had to use my knees and both hands to assemble.  You have to use these stupid clips (which don't stay locked) to hold the sides together and the space left between the sides in the corners is not even, more than 1/2\" in places and tighter in others. A small bird might be tempted to stick its head in there to get out and die trying. The plastic doors on the bottom ends don't fit into the slots, the tabs are too long.  I could probably fix that by filing off some of the plastic, but I'm more concerned with how the cage part just sits shakily on the bottom (and lifts off - nothing holds it down. The plastic perches are throwaways - bad for bird feet!  I raise birds, I'm very disappointed after watching a couple of videos saying how great it was.  I'm going to keep it and see if I can use zip ties and adhesive cable fasteners to keep the sides together and hold down the bottom.  The engineers of this design have nothing to be proud of.  Update:  I filed off the edges of the plastic doors and got them in.  I removed the gadgets that were supposed to hold cage sides together and threw them away, bought some zip ties for the sides, and some adhesive cable clips with zip ties and stuck those along the upper outside edge of the base.  Tied them all tight and now the cage is sturdy, the cage part stays connected while you life off the top of the base to clean. The cage is nice and big, bigger than I expected, but no where near as sturdy as I expected, actually, they are not the right gauge wire for the size. It's perfect for the one story cage. I don't like the seed and water cups being down on the floor. I don't find the doors to be very well made, the latch and the part that it latches to is plastic. For the price I expected a sturdier cage. It will work fine for my two parakeets. I will buy seed cups that hang on the cage wires so they don't have to eat where they poop.  I had to move all the perches down low to get the birds to eat. They've been in the cage a couple days now, apparently it takes some getting used to. A positive is that they get plenty of exercise climbing from perch to perch to get to treat cups, toys, etc. The cage does not hang, I don't think the wires would be sturdy enough to hold the cage if you make your own hanger. It will definitely not be as easy to clean, however the bottom snaps off and you lift the top, it's still awkward for me.  If I saw this in the store before  I probably would not have purchased it, especially for what they are asking for it in the pet shops, it was more than double the price. It will do the job but I can't give it five stars. I have 2 parakeets, and they love this cage!  I love it because it is so easy to clean.  Just pop the top portion off, and it's so easy to wipe.  After awhile I decided to take out the bottom grate (my birds rarely touched it, anyway), and that makes things even easier.  I place paper towels in the bottom of the cage.  One of my birds is a little territorial, so this cage gives them room to live together and yet give them space, too.  They have their own swings on each side.  The doors go down to create like a little grated shelf for them to sit on, which they LOVE.  I put a bowl of water on top of the cage.  They love to sit on those doors when they are down and sometimes fly or climb up to sit on top of the cage, take a bath up there or fly a loop around the room and return to the cage.  I have it sitting on a TV tray table and cover it with a standard black sheet at night.  I would definitely purchase this again, mostly because the shape/size in perfect and because it really is the easiest cage to clean that I have ever owned!! ", "Easy to clean, large enough living for up to 2 parakeets.  Would be great for one small sized parrot, such as a conjure or a set of love birds.  I love to give my pet's plenty of room.  The feed and water bowls are amazingly simple to clean and refill. The pop off feature has two clips on either side and allows for non-intrusive cleaning by lifting the metal up and and off the plastic base and sat on a large puppy pad/newspaper.  Doesn't take long.  The top has bars permitting owner to hang toys.  I wouldn't buy a different brand of cage.  Water and food bowls have a cover restricting bird's ability to defecate in.  The perches have been no problems with my budgie's feet.  Ive owned it since February 2017.  Wanted to own for awhike before reviewing.  Nice set-up and I'm very happy I gave it a try.  Worth it! Excellent and extremely well-priced product. Took about 30 minutes to put together, and fits my 2 parakeets with a lot of extra space, they are super happy! Everything that comes with it is excellent quality, it's aesthetically pleasing, and I have had many compliments on it from my previous cage (not anywhere near this quality). It's not difficult to clean (I lay paper towels on the bottom under the metal grate and just take off the bottom). The food/water bowls are covered so they don't get dirty and are easy to remove, there is a clear plastic lining around the lower portion to control food, poop, and feathers, and the two doors make easy access to the top and lower portions. Thank you for a great and reasonably priced product! The assembly instructions included with this cage are terrible.  Once you figure out how to assemble the cage, it's not too bad.  It's huge, and I think my two parakeets will love it.  I am not sure it's worth the amount it costs, but at $70 with tax, Amazon is cheaper than any other retailer. The main reason for this purchase was that I wanted a larger home for my parrotlet without breaking the bank. This cage was perfect, and works great for us! As others have mentioned, there is no pull-out drawer; you need to unclip two areas on the bottom of the cage (the white tray) and lift the entire upper portion up and place it aside before you can clean. This is no problem for me personally; it is not very heavy and quite easy to do. However, I would imagine for an older individual this could be a problem, especially if the cage is elevated on a table or something; so be aware of this. I have two small parakeets (budgies) and I purchased a cage from Pe*** for $40. It is a nice cage but only half the hight and approximately five inches shorter lengthwise than this new cage. It was fine for my two young birds but they weren't playing with their toys, just didn't seem very lively. So I went to Amazon (my favorite website) and looked up bird cages. I came across this one. I read the reviews and I had to give it a try. Oh my goodness my little feathered friends LOVE THEIR NEW HOME! About 25 minutes to snap together and it was well worth the time. My birds are doing things I've never seen then do before. They have so much room to play with their toys, and the best part is that the bars of the cage run sideways rather than up and down. They can clime without sliding back down! They are very happy and so am I. I would definitely purchase another one if I start breeding and would encourage others about this great cage. The price is amazing for this product. I highly recommend this cage. I love this cage! And I'd buy it again. PROS This is the best birdcage I've ever bought. Easy to assemble, just sort out all parts beforehand and follow the directions carefully. This a pretty cute cage. The point of this cage is not having a pull out drawer, to minimize seed mess, so I won't complain about that because its why I bought it. The directions for assembly are really not difficult, took me about fifteen minutes. The cute and easy to clean perches are great, as are the separate food and water bowls. It's not a sturdy metal cage, so if you have predators in your house like kitty cats, find a way to make sure it can't be knocked over and you'll be fine, otherwise should it hit the floor the chances look good it will come apart. When assembled one thing was weird, the sides don't come together in a flush fashion, you have to clip them with the provided clips, so when you look at the cage it's not straight on the vertical edges as nicely as the photo depicts. But as far as having happy, safe birds, it does the trick for a great price. I will buy another one after I fashion a way to wire it to the wall so my cats can't knock it down. For everyday purposes this is awesome, for a house full of birds and cats like me, you have to be careful and creative but it's doable for sure. As far as being easy to clean, I have no idea why people say it isn't, it really is. No more bird seed mess in my house! Thanks Vision! I would urge anyone that wants to purchase this cage for a parakeet to reconsider. I bought this cage for my two parakeets in hopes of them having a cage that allowed them space to explore, and for the \"mess-free\" assumption. I bought 3 of these. One for a cockatiel, one for a Quaker parrot and one for a parakeet. The parakeet one, we didn\u2019t use all the parts because he\u2019s still a baby and I didn\u2019t want him to go too high yet. Once he gets older I\u2019ll put the top half on. All my birds love their new homes. It\u2019s nice to be able to just open the doors outwards and let them out and they have a perch to chill outside their cages. Easy to clean. I\u2019m no crazy about the food bowls so I am getting heavy crocks to put in there instead but I do like the covers over the food. So I will just my my own covers to go over the crocks. The concept is good and that is what is important. So far I haven\u2019t seen one seed or hull outside their cages. ", "I bought this based on a co-worker's recommendation.  Worth every penny.  Because of the modular design, you have to be careful during assembly but designed to break down so no problems there.  The biggest feature is maintenance.  This design keeps the area 90% cleaner than the old cage we had.  The water and food bowls took some getting used to taking in and out until I realized they are designed so they are locked in place so the little monsters can't throw them around, GENIUS!  I place tough towels over the grate on the bottom.  Every day I pop the two clamps that hold the cage to the base and then lift the cage unit, birds and all, off, roll up the paper towels and put down a new liner.  So much easier and now the cage is kept cleaner.  Birds have great room and the perches are easy to move around to keep them interested.  OH!  There are these shields that go over the food and water bowls.  GENIUS! This cage was MUCH bigger than I thought it would be.  And it's Nice!  So easy to put together.  I made a few mistakes but it was easy to rectify once I realize I made them.  Nothing came broken, nothing broke while putting it together and nothing broke in taking the piece I put on wrong off and putting it back on.  My brand New birds that aren't tamed yet went easily into this new cage, I swear they saw it and were like, \"We Won the Lottery!\"  I'm so please with it.  And for the price...???? Come on, Man! You can't beat it!  I just saw the M01 in a local pet store and they were selling it for TWICE the price of this one.  Buy it.  You won't regret it!  There is absolutely NOTHING I wish was different about this cage.  They really thought this cage through before they made it.  How rare is that? we replaced a smaller cage our lovebird seemed to be afraid of that we had purchased at a local pet store for about the same price as this one. She used to spend all her time in the coconut we purchased for her to sleep in. Now she is moving around the cage, eating more food, bathing in the water dish, just acting like a totally different bird. I purchased the large cage but we decided to only use the lower half for now and keep the additional parts in case we decided to get additional  birds. It was only twelve dollars more so it's well worth it for us to have the option. The instructions are pretty straight forward and easy to follow, I would suggest reading them first, then follow the steps in order while putting the cage together. It is a very good cage at a reasonable price Normally, I think this product would have been a really great cage. I spent a lot of time researching bird cages and Vision seemed to be the brand everyone was raving about. My two parakeets seem to love it. However I had some issues with it. Firstly, it was a pain to assemble. The instructions weren't very clear at all and I had to hunt down youtube videos just to figure out what the heck I was doing and normally I'm very good at putting things together on my own. Secondly, the one I received was defected so the base of my cage doesn't hold together with the top of it. The bars don't pop in place into the holes in the plastic part because when it was made in the factory the bars were chopped off after the last horizontal bar.. For the hefty price I spent on this I expected more quality. Unfortunately it was such a big package I really didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back especially after all the effort of putting it together so my birds are still in it and I use it as is. I just set the top part over the base and it seems to hold. It sits down on it pretty well but that's not the point. However I probably won't ever buy this brand again. This is a good sized cage for at least 2 parakeets but can handle 4. It is really well made and has many ingenious built in features such as the plastic transparent shield that borders the entire bottom of the cage where the feeders are located ... reduces mess to almost none! Lots of nice doors [6 altogether : 4 in the front of the cage, 2 on each side for accessing the feeders].  As the paperwork indicates, this was designed by bird experts and I really believe that! It\u2019s the second one I\u2019ve bought from this company, and the main reason is because of its sturdiness. I have 4 cats and I don\u2019t have to worry about them knocking it over, as they do tend to jump on it when I\u2019m not looking. It\u2019s a little bit of a pain to put together but it\u2019s all worth it in the end, the perches are nice and can be moved wherever you want. The ease of cleaning is a big plus and the seeds and mess are kept inside the cage because of the cool design. All in all this cage works for me and I believe it will for you also. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy one and your bird will be happy too. This is great! The only downfall is I have to have someone else help me when I clean out the tray. This is now home to 15 zebra finches who love it, but they also like to go to the bottom of the cage. The suggestion of others to just lift it off the tray and set the cage down does not work when you have 15 little flying critters. I have to lift the cage up and have someone pull the tray out for me, then quickly put the cage back down. I've been putting wood shavings in the bottom tray which works great! Instead of having to clean the paper lining of my old cage twice a week, I can get away with cleaning this one once every two weeks. The bottom feeding cups keep the seed hulls contained.  Since I have so many little birds, I had to supplement the perches with tree branches so they all have somewhere to perch, but I had to do the same with my old cage also.  It is tall enough that I put all their nests on the right side of the cage to make condo style living. I also added a large white mesh seed protector to the top of the cage. No more poop on the walls! It didn't take long for the birds to adapt to their home and they really seem to enjoy it. This is my second purchase of this brand of cage. I went up in size for my cockatiel and sun conure so they have more room to move around and spread their wings. They love to run up and down and it gives me more room to rotate toys and foraging boxes and has enough room for a corner perch and the price is way more affordable now than when i first purchased it. Definitely easier to clean. Awesome cage! I have two parakeets and they have tons of room! It is WAY bigger, and more sturdy than I expected, and the amount of vacuuming I do around the cage has reduced drastically! The directions were kind of confusing but if you take your time it's not that bad! I would recommend purchasing this item! Got it for my two parakeets and might get two more since it's big size cage. Took me about 10-15 minutes to put together not too hard simple following instructions. I looked at local pet stores and didn't find any thing close to this size and similar price. ", "I love this birdcage and so does my lovebird, Pablo! It took me about three hours to put together, mostly because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to attach the bottom and I did not feel the instructions were clear. However, once I finally figured out what I was doing wrong (the bottom tabs have to be \u201cclicked in\u201d INSIDE the bars, not on top of the metal tabs), it was a winner! I love the size. It\u2019s plenty big for my lovebird, Pablo, to move around and play. It\u2019s also very sturdy. Pablo enjoys the clear plastic bottom, which contains the mess nicely, but also allows him to see out. The perches are nice for his feet and can easily be moved around from outside the cage. My bird is happy, so I\u2019m happy! Thanks for this great product! I can attest the instructions are woeful.  once you get it it is easy but it takes awhile to od it and getting the thing to click in place properly (one wire below, one above) is a pain in the a$$ and they are liable to come out just when you are trying to get the next panel in place, and be careful to use the ones without the plastic clips for the bottom set or you will have to take it all apart and redo it. Very very disappointed in this cage so far.  The box was suspiciously beat up and taped.  It was obviously returned by someone else.  Now I get to sit in traffic for an hour or more to return this mistake.  I am not certain who is to blame here:  the manufacturer, or Amazon. My husband & I did have a tricky time putting it together...but it is not hopeless! I wanted to it solo...and searched for a You Tube video for help...none existed. The directions for the bottom are fine..then it starts getting sketchy. He did have to take it apart & try again a few times. BUT! This cage houses two baby parakeets & I LOVE IT! The bottom clear plastic makes for east cleaning, & keep my dogs noses out of it (it is placed high up). Add a variety of different perches and some toy's and it is really is a nice cage!! I bought this cage because I was looking for a more modern look in a bird cage for our home. The Vision bird cage fits the bill! The cage has clean modern lines and looks beautiful. Innovative design is the MO2. We have 9 parakeets in 2 purchased 2 months ago thru Amazon. Durable and remains clean, capturing all debris.  The custom breeding boxes by Vision are perfect and frequently visited by our currently nesting female in one cage. This is a great value on a quality birdcage. So much attention is given to the features in this cage. From snap together tabs and twist turn openings and secure fastenings. There are even little shields to protect seed and water cups from waste droppings.  I'm very pleased with this purchase. I would give this a 5 star rating but for the shipping packaging- which is basically nothing additional other than the manufacturer's box it comes in. I had to return and replace mine as it was cracked upon delivery. The second one was fine. This is a great price for the quality. The four star rating is because there was a broken piece of plastic on the clear part of the base, on one of the feeding doors, but it isn't so bad that I can't use the cage. Fairly easy to assemble and definitely easier to clean than the previous cage my birds were in. I have 2 parakeets and 2 zebra finches housed together and wasn't sure there was going to be enough room. This is more narrow by 5 inches but 10 inches taller than their previous enclosure but they really seem to like it. I've read from other reviews about how to clean it and yeah, it's not ideal having to take the whole caging piece off the base to clean but I usually just place the caging on a towel on table I have near by and the birds stay with no problem so I can clean the base. I take a wet rag to wipe down the feces off the grate and then dump the empty seed shells in trash, wipe the base down and then put the caging back on. There's too many horizontal bars which encouraged my budgies to hang on the cage walls. Though you cannot avoid some horizontal bars, a better designed cage would have less of these so birds stay away from hanging from the cage walls. Also, it was difficult positioning the perches in such a way as to completely avoid droppings from landing onto the food trays at the bottom of the cage. Eventually, I removed the food trays and installed hanging trays on the side of the cages. Lots of good features but the ones I listed above mainly hurt its score, for me. ", "This was the best cage for the price... (since I have diamond doves I never installed the bottom grate and I put a few inches of sand instead) the clear seed guard is awesome and cleanup is way easier! The area around the cage stays clean as well I like this birdcage. It was fairly easy to assemble, the instructions were clear. My favorite part is how easy it is to clean. The whole top lifts off, so I can keep my bird in the cage while I clean out the bottom part. Another thing I like is it is very easy to change the food and water daily. There are little doors and the trays lift out easily. My only complaint is that I wish the price were not so high. Other than that, my parrotlet is very happy in her new cage. The cage was kind of difficult to put together. The instruction manual is filled with diagrams that kind of fail to describe exactly how to assemble the cage, but me and my mother were able to figure it out together. The cage itself is wonderful. It is very tall and provides my two parakeets with plenty of room to move around in. All the toys I bought them fit in and the base is fairly large. There are two side doors where the food and water bowls are that make refilling them easy without sticking your hand in the cage and disturbing the birds. The cage also looks nice on a table and doesn't make my room look cluttered. My cat cannot fit her paws through the space between the wires, so it might also be an ideal cage if you have a curious feline in the house. All in all, I am very glad I bought this cage and would recommend it to others. It\u2019s a beautiful product. The only issue I have was that it\u2019s missing a piece. I called the company and they are sending me the missing part. Installation was ok following the steps. Excellent service. Other than this the cage is very sturdy. I like the feeding compartment so that seeds stay in place and not fly out. My bird has plenty of room for toys. The cage came with several perch items which my birds loves. Easy to clean. I just love it. I've got this cage for my tiels. I love that it is tall and gives them a lot of space that way, it is also a good width. However from the front to back it is quite narrow. I still like it though, and I love that it is very easy to clean. All you do is unsnap the two plastic snaps at the bottom, lift it up and put the cage somewhere while you clean the bottom. I will say building the cage was VERY difficult for me. The directions did not help. It kept falling apart as I built it and I kept having to start over. I finally got the hang of it but it was so hard! What sold me on the cage, was it's clean look and multiple perches. What turned me off was the lack of well written instructions! Saying this cage could be assembled in 10 -15 minutes is adding insult to injury.  After working endlessly for two hours, I retorted to the picture on the box to guide me through this frustrating experience.  The instructions are worthless, substituting very poor graphics for written instruction made this task extremely frustrating. That being said Fred and Sylvia (my parakeets) love their new home. I cant tell you how excited I was to wait on this to arrive with all the new goodies I bought my new pet budgies. After reading all reviews and doing research on which to choose that would fit their needs best I was broken hearted to see that it was cracked and broken upon arrival. Looks like I will be dealing with a very aggravating return now. Would give this product another try because of the great pics, reviews and videos I've seen on it, sure this is just a accident, it's the largest product box to ever arrive to me from Amazon this cage, the medium m02 is enormous! I love the cage. We have a medium size tall version, and it has more than enough space for our one canary, who has enough space to fly from perch to perch. It is very classy looking and easy to work with. I love it that the food and water bowls have \"umbrellas\" to cover them from droppings, this is the first cage I've ever seen that has this feature - brilliant idea! Another great feature is that you can clean the feeders without having to stick your hand into the cage and bother the bird. Perches are easy to move around, also without having to put your hand into the cage. The only thing I would change to make this product perfect is to have a sliding out tray at the bottom for easier cleaning. The way it is now - you have to unsnap the bottom and remove the cage from the bottom tray to clean. It is no big deal, but if there was a sliding tray, it would make the cleaning easier. The bottom design keeps the seeds from falling outside the cage so there is no or little mess around the cage, and the clear plastic allows you to see the bird even when he is sitting on the bottom of the cage. Really big! Love the perches and keeps my rug clean. My birds love it! This cage is very big and my cockatiel has lots of space in it, so I don't know why people are saying it's too small for a cockatiel, it's not. It's built well and easy to put together. Like other reviews please keep in mind that you have to LIFT the whole cage off the bottom to clean it, it does not have a slide out tray. (i've gotten used to cleaning it by now so it's not a big problem for me) The only issue I have with this cage is that my bird refuses to eat at the bottom where the food is supposed to be; I have to take out the food bowls and put them on top of the cage for him to come out and eat it, because he won't go down there himself and eat, which is a problem if I happen to be gone all day. I'm going to have to buy something separate to put new food bowls in and put them near the top of the cage, which defeats the whole purpose of the bottom area being \"no mess\". I'm not sure why my bird hates it so much, but overall this is still a very nice cage and it was worth it. ", "We just got this cage last night, brought it home and put it together. It was a bit difficult to put together as the instructions have very poor pictures with very little detail in each step. There is literally 1 short line of direction in each step. Once I got it together, it really looked great. I'm very hopeful that the location of the food dish will help to reduce the amount of shells and food that end up everywhere. (And we used to have those sheer seed guards around her other cage! 2 of them!!!) I'm a little concerned that my Cockatiel might have a hard time getting back up from the bottom of the cage where the dishes are as it is solid clear plastic and she can barely reach the wire part of the cage with her beak to pull herself up. Also a little concerned that the access doors on the front panel open both ways. They should just open forward. There isn't a catch to keep them from falling inward, possible on your bird(s). Other than that, the panels are pretty standard. Spacing between the bars is probably about 1/2 inch, so there is no concern with my cockatiel getting stuck there. It's a pretty good quality and once you get everything assembled correctly with all the supports and brackets, it seems pretty stable! My bird was overwhelmed and didn't know what to do with herself. This is my second purchase of this cage. I inherited another bird which needed a much larger cage than he had been kept in. The fact that I bought one a second time says it all. This cage is very well thought out and designed. Easy to put together and take it apart. It comes with 4 plastic perches that have tapering diameter (this is supposedly healthier for the birds), 2 food/water trays and two plastic covers to protect the food/water trays from poop! Also, this cage looks much better to look at. There is zero mess outside the cage and cleaning couldn't have been easier. Love that it is more tall than large at the base... exactly what small birds need... a lot of vertical room. And finally, the horizontal bar design makes it much easier for my parakeets to climb their cage walls. Highly recommended. Loving the horizontal bars on this cage. My budgie is already super happy being able to climb everywhere. I like the snap system and how you can pick up the entire cage and easily clean the bottom and grate. My last cage had the plastic drawers which were a pain. The main rating is not for the cage itself..but the way the seller mailed the cage. They just slapped a shipping label on the box and it was very badly beaten up by the time it was delivered. Which resulted in a missing piece. There is a connector that you snap in to stabilize the two main pieces together and mine is missing one. The cage seems stable enough without it but annoying nonetheless. I Love this cage! It shows smaller birds on the box but I have two cockatiels in it with a lot of room! It is built so well and has amazing features like 4 easy to open doors, side access to food cups, HORIZONTAL WIRES SO BIRDS CAN CLIMB!!, and very sturdy and safe for my sweet birds. They are so happy! It's easy to clean and I expect this will last as long as my birds...20 years! Thank you Vision!! My lovebird managed to turn the latch on the lower door where the food/water goes.  I had sadly put the cage outside as it was a beautiful day.  He somehow managed to manipulate the latch from the inside and open it himself.  I am really sad my bird is gone.  Buyer Beware.  It is a nice cage and does a great job of keeping seed inside, but birds with a lot of beak dexterity and smarts can open it.  I think parakeets or cockatiels will be ok, but lovebirds might be able to figure it out. I have a zebra finch named FeFe who I have kept in the starter cage (like 12\u201dw x16\u201dd x20\u201dh) since I got him a year ago. I am very pleased with this purchase.  I worried that it might be flimsy because of he great price, but I\u2019m happy with how well made the cage is. i can not stress enough, that this is the best bird cage if had for the price, its easy to clean, easy to fill the foot and water, keep the bird from making a mess with their food around the cage, only issue is i wish the top came off easier, for a cage u don't hang u figured it would have a opening top. my birds like to hang out on the top of the cages, 1 of my birds has a bad wing and cant fly, she can get to the top of the cage fine, but has allot of trouble getting back in it even tho i set many braches so she can work her way down. Love this cage!!! When it says no mess they mean no mess. Only a feather or two on my floor. If you are looking for a nice cage and you don't want any seeds on the floor, this is the one. I am disabled and can't clean clean the seeds up, with my OCD I couldn't handle any seeds on my floor. LOL! I have bought two cages, this one and a smaller one. I have a family of finches in this big one and a couple of Parakeets in the smaller size. ", "Very nice and spacious cage for my two parakeets. Could probably house 4 parakeets comfortably if you let them out of the cage a couple hours each day. There is no longer any food falling on the floor, but there is an updraft of little feathers that fly up when the birds fly around the bottom of the cage and then end up on the floor. The feeding doors are a plus, but it is kind of a pain in the butt to put together. Overall, a good cage and a good purchase for my parakeets. Love this cage, we have a house full of animals, dog, cat, fish, and now 2 birds. I agree, wish it had a slide out draw but all the other features make up for it.  We have two parakeets and we only need half the cage, but we have both leaves together . I love that it can be two different sizes. With a cat in the house we also needed a very strong cage. Our cat has not done anything to the birds, but on more than one occasion she has climbed it, loves to rub up against it. It dose not budge not an inch. There are rubber feet that keep it where you put it. 4 doors and lots of space for them to fly in the cage. Love this happy place for our birds. Been using it for a little while to see pros n cons. Like the size, plenty of room for my canary. Keeps food in cage, doesn\u2019t allow food droppings. I like everything except one BIG prob. Difficult to clean. First cage I\u2019ve seen that does NOT have a pull out tray. Took me a while to figure out a way without disturbing, moving, or having my bird fly away. It\u2019s a task. Big con but my bird is happy, he could fit all his toys, tree perch, swing, bathtub, etc. I bought this cage as a cage to use for when we need to travel and cannot move the larger cage. I've never been happier with a bird cage! I originally ordered one but after using for a length of time I was so happy I ordered a second one. It really does contain all the mess! The seed , feathers , etc., stay inside the cage! No mess on the floor. It's a good size for several small birds such as finches. The bottom removes easily for cleaning. The access doors at the bottom allow one to change the food and water easily. It arrived on time with no damaged or missing pieces. I  highly recommend this cage! The box seem little damaged or looked like it was opened. After opening, I found 3 pieces were missing.  Its little hard to figure out but we couldnt put it together all the way without those 3 pieces. I had to find those pieces and order them because I really didnt feel like sending it back and wait for a replacement. I have another bird in a small cage waiting for the new cage to be done. It looks great in size. I plan to get another one for my parakeets so I have matching cages. I will give more stars after its put together and determine the final review. So I've used this cage for about a month now. I've had a Vision M01 for years for my two parakeets. Finally upgraded to the larger of the two medium sized cages. Brids love the cage although I threw out the cheap perches right away the rest of the cage is solid and took 10 minutes to set up. It's the perfect size cage for up to 3 parakeets. Any more than that you need the L series of cages. This cage was very time consuming to put together. But I am sure that is the case with any sturdy cage that needs to be assembled upon purchase. The clips and the food doors took the longest. Cuts down on floor mess by 99%.  Awesome!  pretty easy to assemble.  Did it by myself and took about 30 minutes.  Super fast free shipping through amazon.  I have two finches in it but plan on putting another two in.  Plenty of flight room.  I dont think I would put anything larger than a small conure in this cage.  Did not like the perches, kinda cheesy and cheap looking so I put my own in.  Food and water dishes so easy to change without chancing your birds getting out lol.  You do have to take the entire top off to clean bottom but this is honestly very easy!! cage is not heavy at all.  I would rather deal with this once a day rather than cleaning up the floor mess 10 times a day! ", "Worst cage ever. Birds can escape while cleaning the bottom of the cage...it does not make it an \"easy to clean\" cage as described. It was pretty annoying and not as sturdy to put together but once it is all set, it becomes sturdy. The doors are small and open inward inside the cage which is odd and makes it difficult to put any other toys or bird baths in...why?! Because only your hand fits through. Regret this purchase. Not worth any stars. I bought the medium sized tall cage for 2 parakeets, but, it could fit a total of 4 birds, it is very spacious for my birds. I would not recommend this for a larger bird than 4 parakeets and or 2 love birds sized birds This cage is tall and narrow, the birds will fly from perch to perch and from the top to the bottom, but, it is really to small for long soaring flights. But, over all it is a very well built cage for small birds. They are not cramped at all, and they play wonderfully in their cage and I have the soft longer rope perches, which they love.I have quite a number of things hanging toys in their cage to play with.The nice thing is the clean up, the birds eat on the bottom of their cage and they do not leave a mess. I would highly recommend this cage because it is easy to clean and the birds seem to be very happy. The cage was a lot higher than I expected.  But my three zebra finches love it.  They started making a little nest so they should be comfortable.  Easy to clean, we just put a news paper at the bottom.  The only thing is that both food thingies are open, so they sit in the bird food sometimes when they eat and take little baths in the water bowl.  Also, the white plastic clips for the doors are quite big and obstruct the view a bit.  If you think it is too high, you can actually convert it to a 'M01'!  And this one was even cheaper :-).  As many others have noted, they don't make a mess outside the cage, very different from the old one I had 20+ years ago, where I but sand on the bottom.  So overall, a great cage. This is the best birdcage I have ever owned. In my experience, there is a lot less feathers, seeds and debris around the bird cage in comparison from the old metal bird cage I used to own. I didn't had any problems building it and unlatching the base for clean up is easy, in fact, I used to do the same procedure with my old bird cage, I never liked the old method of sliding base. Granted, it is an expensive bird cage but for what its worth, it is one of the best cages out there. I recommend it. My cage arrived damaged.  Another replacement cage was also damaged.  Rather than replace this one, which had less damage,  I assembled the cage and I am keeping it. I was able to repair the cage with resin. The cage works great but there is one major issue that I was not expecting (and should not happen): After 1.5 years, I'm down to one perch (started with 4). I have two normal sized budgies. Nothing extraordinary about them, but I have seen two perches snap right off (see picture). I didn't see the first perch break but two others broke right before my eyes. The bird was sitting on it's perch minding it's own business when \"SNAP\" out of nowhere the perch snapped off. Scared the poor bird quite a bit too. I'm giving it three stars because of this issue. I'm hoping there is a way to get more perches because one is simply not enough for two male budgies... The cage is nice looking and very roomie for parakeets or smaller parrots. However the fact that you have to take it apart to change the liner is ridiculous. There's no pull out tray or way to replace the liner without taking the entire bottom off. Terrible design for that fact. Otherwise I'd of given it 5 stars for sure ! This cage was everything I expected, it can be used as a single or double occupancy. The only thing I had trouble with was the assembly. The direction are not easy to understand. The manual was more of a picture guide instead of something you can read. I received my 2nd cage of this type. Well the top front panel with the doors on it, had all the parts facing the wrong way When I put it together the correct way, when the manufacturer put it together they did it wrong. I had to pop out all the fixings and turn them around on that panel. That was not a easy task. Love the cage but I was not happy about that. i thought I would never get the pieces out and back in right. Took me awhile but I finally got I accomplished. Nice cage but if I decide to order another I sure hope I dont have to go threw all that trouble. The first one came perfect. My parakeets love the cage though. And the base does help cut down on the mess. I really love this cage. My two birds live very confortable there. They have space even to fly a little) they are parakeets) the ensamble was really easy (my 13 year old did all the job) it doesn\u2019t seem  very sturdy but it stays well. Also is easy to clean, the fact that it has an easy removal of the base helps a lot. ", "Our first set of budgies. They were hand raised and love their new home. It is nice an high for them to move around. I added extra \"toys\" which limited their flight from spot to spot. It is easy to clean the cage. Since the cage is tall and I put the cage on a tall stand, it was hard to reach the top to lift. However, if you have a short stand, the high is not a problem. You can also have smaller sheets in the center to remove daily and change the whole cage bottom sheet once a week. The long perches are ideal since provides a little room so they don't kill each other when sitting together chatting away on the previous day activities. Yes, they are two female budgies. it took me about a year to finally convince myself to buy this dream cage, i was so excited to set it up but when i received the package i noticed that the clear plastic base had broken into about 4 pieces. as disappointed as i was i still managed to fuse the biggest chunks together and viola! it works great. i didn\u2019t want to go through the time and torture of returning this product and waiting for a replacement. my parrotlet on the other hand could care less about the cracks in his cage! he loves his new little home so that\u2019s all that really matters to me (\u2022: After days of research, I decided to give this cage a try for my new Bourke Parakeet. This is a great cage that deserves 5 stars. However, mine came shipped from Monster Pets and arrived with a label just stuck to the outside of the cage box. It was not in a shipping box. So because it's not really a shipping box - it's chipboard, not corrugated - the corners were crushed and thus the corners of the cage were smashed. Now I have to bring it to a UPS Store to be shipped back to them and then supposedly they'll send a new one. This is my second cage like this and it's a great cage (easy to clean, wide openings that allow you to put a bird bath in it), but it needs to be shipped differently so it gets here in one piece! Not having a slideout tray at the bottom is really not a plus for me and makes the cage difficult to clean. The doors are VERY nice though. Two sets of doors that open that become a big door/opening with both opening. Ive had the cage a while now and i can see that it holds up well to how often ive cleaned it. But tbere are discoloration in some areas of the metal at the bottom. Its been a really great size for my suvar gliders though. I have two parents and a baby in there now. And they seem to be very happy with it ^_^. You can tell that the company put some careful thought into the design. It is very simple to set up and maintain. If I were to change something, however, I would just make those four small gates on the front just two, or even one large gate. And maybe make the food dishes a little larger. This cage has many problems. Assembly takes FOREVER! The instructions said it would take 20 minutes, but this took me at least an hour and a half to set up. Two out of the four perches have snapped so far for no reason! This cage is a pain in the butt to clean. While most cages have the very easily accessible slide out tray, this cage has to be completely taken apart to clean! \ud83d\ude20 do NOT buy this cage! It's so stupid. None I have had the shorter version for my singing canary for a while. Really keeps the seed scattering on the floor way down. So I decided I would buy the taller version for my parakeets. They love it and it's ver well made and easy to put together. Best designed bird cage I have ever had. This bird cage is big enough for my cockatiel. Can't say enough about it.  Everything was packaged well so it arrived safe and in perfect condition. Putting it together was very easy. ", "I felt like the clips were a little hard to snap. The cover on the bowls don't stay in place. This is my second vision cage and they are by far the best. I need to get a large cage when went from one Parakeet to three. All three are very happy and have plenty of room. I feel this one just has some defects that was disappointing. Great cage for our Green Cheek Conure. Easy to assemble. While I love the guard around the bottom to keep things from spilling out, it's not the easiest cage to clean. We have to lift the cage to take the whole bottom off which makes it a 2 person job. Overall I'm pretty satisfied though. This is a nice beautiful cage but the wire are very flimsy, can be broken off easy. One of the side panel for the back side one corner and it on the bottom wire got broken loose.  Need to be extra care when install. And yes the directions is very poor writing and pictures too small to see or understand. It is very easy to setup and very easy to clean. The perches are great, there were 4 and they all came in different shapes. But at first my new  Cockatiel didn't eat out of the bowls in the bottom so we had to buy different cups, but now he does. In all I am very glad I bought this cage and not a bigger more expensive kind of vision, because this can probably even fit another bird! I really like this product. Instructions were easy to follow, perfect size for my two parakeets. The only flaw is that one of the wires on a panel was broke. I had already put the entire thing together when I discovered this. My finches love this cage - plenty of room for toys and flight.  Assembly was relatively easy, just a bit time consuming.  Super easy to clean and easy to change water and food.  My cockatiel cage and parakeet cages are harder to clean than this one.  Finches have no problem staying in the top part of the cage while I clean.  We've had this for a year and a half with no issues. I don't know if I would put anything too large in this cage, but it seems like it would hold 4 'keets just fine. I think the tails and wingspan for 'tiels would be too long. I could see conures living in this thing pretty well... This is my first birdcage and I'm super happy with my choice. As I was snapping this together, I was thinking that the company really put some thought into this design. The materials are great quality and everything just makes sense. It's easy to assemble and easy to clean. It's a great size, perfect for my little budgie Bert. I like the doors on the bottom sides that allow you to access the food and water without reaching your hands inside. Good cage! Love this cage, this is the second one I have procured, I added it to the previous one to give more room to my birds. ALso left me with extra parts if needed.  My finches love the added space. My bird loves his new cage... Bought him a smaller cage since we are loving and down sizing and his current cage is pretty large. For the price it is great for my green cheek conure. He has plenty of room to play. Only thing he has to get used to is his bowls at bottom of cage and he has to use ladder to get down.. Bc of the plastic siding at bottom.. ", "This is a great bird cage! I am using it for one small love bird and the size and height is great! Having food trays on the bottom along with the tall/solid plastic base has completely stopped the bird's seed debris from getting everywhere around the cage! I bought this cage for my Quaker Parrot  He hated it!  I think there was something about the plastic wall around the bottom.  I have other cages and I switch off every now and then.  I've tried him in this cage for over a year and he still hates it. This things great' first off its not like any normal bird cage I've ever had. It is more erganomic than standard cages the birds are fascinated with its base they spend more time playing there than before and love to fly around from purch to purch they are a lot more active. It wasant to bad to assemble just have to follow instructions and pictures.nice price looks great, doors open nice and quiet easy to clean undo latches on base set news paper next to slowly lift cage and set on news paper. be carful not to spook birds they could fly out . Go clean base  like normal and replace.  The clear vision area I clean with a soft wet cloth to keep it nice. Overall this cage gives the birds more room without any strange shape suprizes its more a birds bird cage so to speak. I would recommend cage to anyone with small to medium birds they will thank you. Nice design vision had a vision and here it be :-) We had the original vision bird cage, and since that one was so good we decided to try the new model. We have had at least one bird for 12 years, and have tried numerous cages. The Vision ones seem to be the best, and much better than the metal cages. It is really easy to put together. All of the water and food is protected by the plastic both over the bowls and around the outside. Anyone who has ever had birds know they make a mess, and this cage really contains it. I have added a couple of extra perches, but they still seem to prefer the ones that come with the cage. It is easy to clean since the bottom comes right off. You do have to lift the cage and make sure the birds don't fly out, but mine have been fine so far. The only downside is it is awkward to carry. I do like to let them go outside in the cage, and since there is no handle at the top it isn't the easiest to carry around. Overall Vision comes through again with the best product on the market. It was a little confusing to build but after it was done, I can say it was worth it. This cage is so futuristic. Its beautiful. I have an old budgie with foot problems. She loves the cage so I love it too. The clear plastic guard on the bottom was cracked and broken in 3 of the 4 corners. The wire where it snaps into itself was bent so I'm pretty sure I got one that was sent back at some point. Despite the instructions, it was a pain to put together and took me almost an hour due to having to do it twice since the first time I put the top half on the bottom rather than vice versa. Not bad for $70 but still at least expected it to be in good shape. I opened on my porch to first inspect it and got a couple pics of the cracks. It's for my daughters birthday, she wanted parakeets and since we have the birds and they're stuck in a tiny cage, we decided to keep it and hope for the best. We will buy some where else when this one fails. This bird cage is amazing and very easy to put together. Once, correctly put together, the cage is very sturdy. I only had this for one day, but notice a big difference in the amount of mess my bird were putting on the floor, which is nothing. ONLY thing I find kinda weird is that I can seem to find anywhere ONLINE a medium piece of cage floor lining made specific for this model. There's only small and large. I also can't seem to find the medium sized bird cover for this product either. Guess I need to do more digging around for it. I do love this cage but the only reason i gave it 4 stars, is that it is NOT as easy to assemble as it states in the video! The enclosed directions say it should take about 15 minutes? Not at all, it was more like 35 which is still not bad, but be realistic Awesome cage! Nice size and seems sturdy. Instructions are a bit difficult to follow but after the first few its pretty easy to put together. Shipping was fast! Received sooner than expected. Would highly recommend! We weren't sure about this cage at first when we purchased it back in November, but we have come to really love it. There are more plastic pieces than we prefer and our birds did not at all like the green food dishes and refused to eat from them, but once they got used to their new surroundings and we made some changes, they came to love it too. It is very spacious with lots of different places to perch. They also love to climb up and down all of the walls. We only left in two of the green plastic perches and added real wooden ones to replace the others. We use stainless steel bowls for food and water, which they are much happier with. We can also fit a couple of swings and toys and it is a very homey abode for them. It should be noted that our birds do spend most of their day out of the cage, but overnight and on days we are not home, it is a very roomy place for them to hang out and be comfortable. Should we get more birds, we would buy another one of these in a heartbeat. ", "I bought this for my parrotlets. Despite the instructions being rather unclear, once I figured out how to snap it together it went together rather quickly. I like all of the doors it has so I can easily access all parts of the cage. My son likes being able to open the little food door to place a treat in their bowl. I also like that I can attach small toys to the plastic perches that come with it. One thing I would add to improve it if I were the company would be to add a ladder from the bottom to where the bars start. My birds got down to the bottom and then stared through the clear plastic walls trying to figure out how to get back up until i put a ladder in there for them. But overall they are very happy with their new home. This cage was for my 3 parakeets, they absolutely loved it! The cage took a bit to assemble, I did it wrong the first 2 try but I didn't give up and eventually it worked out! it's really sturdy and easy to clean,  just unhook the side hook things and remove the top piece! I would recommend having another cage to put your bird(s) in while the cage is being cleaned. I love how the doors open in and out btw, super nice for when you want your bird(s) to chill with you.. Also I would say to put the birds food in one of the bowls and water in the other because it's just way easier to refill. It's really 4.5 stars.... I love it, although my clear base had a small crack... I just went with it. It is so much less mess but would be great if there was a pull out tray for cleaning... it is very large and awkward for me to unsnap and place on a surface, while keeping the birds in and unstressed. Great value for the money Cage is larger than I envisioned, but it's amazing! I'll probably leave it to one level and not make it so tall since I only have one parakeet for now. But even then, it's plenty of room. For those that say the installation instructions are bad are just whinny little bitches that like to complain. It really couldn't be any simpler. The 3 parakeets love this cage and so do I.  I put a ladder on the lower side of the cage slanted towards the bottom and a cargo net that I purchase from Amazon, because they were having a difficult time getting to the bottom We really like the size of this cage, and it seems to be pretty sturdy. We're just having a difficult time adjusting to the fact that there's no sliding tray in the bottom to change the dirty new paper more easily. This is a great buy~  easy to assemble, very large.  We have 2 parakeets that love this...lots of space for climbing, spreading their wings and exercise. .  So many spots to hang ladders, perches, bells and toys.  Is excellent for keeping the bird seed shells in the cage and not all over the house. Very easy to change the water and the food with the side door access.  We turned 2 of the front doors around to provide a landing for the birds to reenter. Clean up is easy, you just have to be able to lift the entire cage up from the base, but it is relatively light. Sooooo much easier to clean compared to regular wired cages. My birds live this cage. Plus I can use it as a travel cage for long trips. Love the design and the fact that there is less of a seed shell mess makes me super happy. Best cage ever for my two English budgies.  They have so much fun going up and down and climbing around outside of it.  My only complaint would be that you have to take the whole top cage off to clean it. We have two budgies and wanted to upgrade to a cage that kept the debris/feathers in the bottom as much as possible. So far, it has helped great deal. What I wasn't expecting was the actual size of the cage; it was larger than I visualized, in a wonderful way. The budgies have plenty of room to climb and fly without having to always let them out to get the exercise. They are much happier in this cage. I would definitely recommend. ", "Bought for a relative, no pull out tray to clean, but upper part easily separated and reattached. 2 parakeet occupants and owner of them all seem pleased. A short bit to assemble, snaps together really, once together seems sturdy enough. You may need a little finger strength to assemble and pop things into place. Not exactly the best choice for cage looks nice but not real easy to put together as they indicate I believe it\u2019s gonna be very hard to clean because to get to the bottom tray you have to lift the whole cage off at the bottom tray two person job .Think twice before you buy thank God the price wasn\u2019t too bad So far so good for my new parrotlet.  Helps keep feathers and seeds in the cage.  Even though I get frustrated easily when I am putting items together that need assembly this cage was pretty easy to assemble. The medium cage tall, M02 is very large for my one little parrotlet. This cage is very large and my two parakeets absolutely love it! The debris guard works really well and there is plenty of room for ropes and perches! Assembly wasn't terribly difficult but still took me about 45 minutes to build. I would highly recommend this cage to someone who is looking at getting two birds like budgerigars as it gives them plenty of room to move around and play! The cage itself is great, ordered two, both were damaged (one was workable).  Lots of paperwork to prove I bought it through Amazon and finally got replacement part - which also was cracked but not all the way through.  Gave up. My parrotlet had a fit of joy when he saw his new \"palace\". I was slightly hesitant on this cage due to how shallow the depth seemed, but I found it larger than expected. The design is lovely, set up was simple and required no more than an hour, and cleaning his cage is a great deal less vexing. My sole issue with this cage is the roof; the white paneling reduces the amount of space available for hanging toys/rope perches/etc. Also, I'm currently using stainless steel bowls attached to the sides of the cage rather than the plastic feeders at the base. This is an awesome cage. My cockatiel loves it; we rescued him a few months ago and he came in an old, rusted cage but he seems to be loving this new and more modern one. I love how easy it was to put together and the price cant be beat. The only reason it loses a star is because the food and water dishes are located at the bottom of the cage. My cockatiel is clueless about the bowls because every other bird cage has had them located on the upper levels where he tends to sit. This is the best bird cage I have every had. My parakeets were making such a mess with their seed when they were in the regular cage. Since I put them in The Vision Bird Cage I have no mess at all! It has plenty of room & is very neat & clean. This cage exceeded my expectations! However, I am tempted to give the cage 4/5 stars because the instructions/set up were a pain! Don't even try to use the instructions, they'll only confuse you. The base, bottom grate, and clear plastic part are easy, but after that it gets a little nuts. If you're struggling to put this together like I was, here are a few tips. This cage is not the most well made and has some definite design flaws, manufacturer could have done way better and simplified design, however it is a great cage for those on a budget. It is completely sufficient for any bird needing more space. Please don't keep your birds in small cages, it's tremendously cruel. Buy this cage and respect the wild animals you choose to keep as \"pets\". ", "Easy to assemble.  This works well for birds that are tame but is a challenge to clean when you have birds that are not socialized. Additionally, by parakeet would not go down to the bottom of the cage to access his food. I love this new home for my Parakeets, and they Love it Too!  It's spacious and allows them the room they need to enjoy their own space, as well as cuddle up, if they want to.  The perches are perfect for them, and the plastic bottom really does a great job at keeping all their seeds and things, inside the cage, rather on the floor around it. Bought this cage for our two fancy rats (regular size not the jumbo rats).  Took them a few days, but we added some platforms, hammocks, wheels and walkways in the upper area of the cage and they were all over it. They were so much happier in this than the 20 gallon tank they were in.  I was concerned about the plastic pieces but they haven't chewed them too much.  Keep extra things for them to chew in the cage and plenty to do and they should leave the plastic alone. The first one we received had a damaged part. I called and a new cage was sent immediately. Never received any information for return of damaged cage. It was a little confusing to assemble, but once I figured it all out the cage is very nice and sturdy. We can move the cage without worrying about it coming apart. Lots of extra perches that can be placed wherever you want them. This is a great bird cage. I keep 3 young lovebirds in here and they have a ton of room to play while keeping the mess contained. Easy to clean! I want this to be a very comprehensive review. I had reservations about ordering but am so glad that I did. I was impressed by the weight of the materials even before I assembled it. The assembly was fairly easy and took about 15 minutes. The directions are fairly easy. I would recommend you make sure the little clear tabs snap firmly into the wire as I missed a couple I thought I had already snapped into place.  I was also concerned about the interior size and it is very spacious.  I have had rescue birds for years and would estimate that 4 or 5 parakeets would be comfortable in this cage.  I have 3 in mine. I was going to order a larger one for my 2 cockatiels but, after assembling this one, I just ordered a second one of this model.  I am quite pleased with it.  It is lightweight enough to make it manageable but seems to be of good material. My only concern after assembly was a little gap between the walls at each corner but it is not enough of a gap to allow escape and I don't think it will be a hazard.  If I find the cage has any problems after using it for a while, I will definitely update my review to reflect that.  For now, I am really delighted with the cage quality, the capacity and the open and airy feel to it.  My birds are thrilled with it and chattering away in their little happy voices. So I would recommend this cage as I have had numerous other brands that were far less substantial and not nearly as attractive as this one. I ordered this for my younger sister for her new birds and she loved it. It was roomy and not too difficult to put together. She sent me pictures of the cage with the birds in them. It arrived in the mail on time, even a little earlier than expected. Cage is the perfect size for my parakeets. However there were clips missing so I had to improvise. Difficult to make sense of the instruction booklet. Virtually useless and threw the booklet away. Literally had to figure it out for myself. We love this cage!!!  Saves us space as compared to others and the very best of it... the mess my birds made in other cages is somehow contained in this one so, less clean up. Parakeet loves his new home. It does take time to figure out the assembly, just double check before putting it all together. ", "Absolutely love these bird cages and brands.  They literally leave less of a mess all over the floor as well as leaving their food cleaner.  I already purchased one at Christmas for my daughters canary and loved it so much that we purchased this one for my mothers parakeets. This is an awesome cage. I am currently using it for my rat. I just used little ring to hand plastic desktop paper trays as shelves. Put in some tubing and a hanging cot. She uses every level. Think it would be a little crowded for 2 rats. Is so easy to clean... just pop the top cage off the base. Would very much recommend for a rodent or a bird. Absolutely perfect althoughthe botom doesn't have an easy tray to pull out but we improvised by putting newspaper directly on the bottom grates...the bird's (2 love birds) adore the space and room, though the cage wasn't big enough for my cockatiles (i know 3 was pushing it but I honestly thought it be bigger front front to back) bur for love bird's plenty of room Absolutely love this cage. But it was difficult to put together  came in something like  100 pieces and directions for putting it together were not to clear!  Took me 3 hours to put together. Very easy to clean and seeds stay pretty much in the cage!! What a beautiful cage, my birds love it, this cage provides the freedom that they are missing out on in the wild, and I can't ask for anything else as a bird lover. This cage has kept my floor clean also, not one seed to clean up or even feathers. Love the thing. The design of the cage is very pleasing to the eye - it's very modern and sleek. Cleaning up is easy. Assembly is annoying (but what assembly has ever been fun, am I right?) I bought this cage for my cockatiel. She can\u2019t fly whatsoever, so I thought this cage would be perfect. It was! Building the cage took about 20-30 minutes. It wasn\u2019t too long. I love it. It\u2019s huge. Perfect size. I recommend. This cage is huge. I got it for my cockatiel so he had more room to roam around during the day and it's so tall. He loves it, especially the see through bottom because he can keep an eye on our cat better. Definitely a good cage for the price. My only complaint is that I don't think it's as secure as it should be since most of the parts just kind of snap together. Overall, I'm very happy with our cage though. I do not recommend this cage. I have bought this cage twice and it has broken each time. The first time the plastic around the bottom came cracked. The second time I had only had it for a month when, most of the plastic cracked, two doors come off when you open them, and one door wont even open at all. I\u2019m very disappointed because it breaks so easily. Cage is well made. I put it together without much difficulty.It takes two of us to clean the bottom, but that doesn't matter. This cage helps to keep the rest of the area clean as feathers and bird debri stay inside. ", "Great cage, the idea in theory is perfect, but my bird does not want to eat at the bottom of the cage.  I bought some hook on feeders and plan to slowly lower them in hopes she'll eventually eat from the feeding bowls at the bottom of the cage.  One other issue is I don't like the way the side and front walls connect because they bow out a little, but all and all a nice, functional, large cage for my parrotlet. I absolutely love this cage!!! I don't have seeds and feathers all over the floor anymore and its super easy to clean the bottom.  My conure seems to love it too, especially with how tall it is.  The only thing I would change is to make the top open up also. It really is a great cage and i wish i had bought it months ago. I love this cage, its so spacious! its not to wide so I cant easily fit it on a narrow table but its still tall for space for my two parakeets! Not stable even with extra write to stabilize it  I have had to times where the cage collapsed and one time one of my birds got out.  It does kWh seeds inside of cage Absolutely, wonderful cage.  Accommodating for my birds with plenty of room.  Made of high end, quality material.  Easy instructions and about 20min construction time.  Can not beat the process and quality compared to cheap quality at commercial pet store for same price and less space.  I have 2 (2yrs old) parakeets and 1 finch. It was not easy to put together. I had to refer to the picture on the box more than the instructions. If only wanting 1 level then pretty easy to assemble, second level was difficult. I was missing clips to the sides. Well built cage that can easily be adjusted to accommodate a number of small birds.  We have a couple of small budgies and there is plenty of room.  Changing food and water dishes is extremely easy. Would buy from seller again. Birds and I are happy - great design for viewing and for keeping the mess inside the cage. Easy to clean too! Great for parakeets, although they just stay at the top of the cage. I will start off with saying that the cage itself looks nice and is very easy to put together. Sadly our cockatiel's can easily escape now they have gotten used to the cage which makes it massively risky just for a cage that looks nice. The cage is also a pain to clean and our cockatiel's take that chance to escape as well. Very very poor design and very little thought was put into this cage. ", "This cage appeared to solve several problems we were tired of, and it does. Assembly is easy. Just follow instructions. First problem solved: Food and water dishes are sheltered, protected from droppings. There is a small awning over each little dish, and they work brilliantly. And they are super easy to remove, clean, and replace. The dishes themselves, which come with the cage, one at each end, have a notch that matches a tooth so that the placement is guided and therefore consistent. Removal of each dish is simple: Rotate knob of dish door, open door, remove dish, close door if worried about escape, clean dish, replace, close door, turn knob to lock. Nothing to it. Great size. Super easy to keep clean. Only thing that's annoying is there's no handle or anything. You have to pick up the cage from the bottom the cage itself just sits on the base. So I just used zip ties to hold it together. Putting it through the food doors and the cage wire bottom. Easy fix. Easy to put together. Easy to put together and huge! Great cage at a good price. the Lo2 is a good fit for my birds (finchs) it has room for them to fly and in the top corner they have an area that is semi covered on the out side with ivy (fake washed well it's secured on the outside of the cage) they also have natural sticks there is plenty of room in this cage. After doing a lot of searching for a new bird cage we ended up with the Vision M02. It came on time and packaged fairly well. I immediately went about setting it up an it only took a short amount of time. Got our 2 budgies situated in it and they have been very happy. Lots of room for toys and perches. Definitely helped increase the activity level for them! The cage is very clean looking and doesn't \"take over\" the room. Great price compared to other cages this size. Its a great cage, not difficult to assemble but a little patience is required.  Be careful how you move it.  I had to get a replacement because the D piece, the clear plastic collar that surrounds the base cracked in the corners when I picked it up.  My bird really seems to like it. My 3 budgies Love the new cage, took a while to assemble not gonna lie but it\u2019s a sterdy cage and no mess.The reason it\u2019s a 4 star is cause of how hard it was to assemble but I get why. The instructions were poorly thought out.Also if your under 12 years you probably need adult help cause it could be quite difficult to put together. Overall I love the cage and I would buy it again it\u2019s recommended Best bird cage I've ever had. It's solid, great quality. The design it's amazing, great for the bird and super easy to clean. I purchase the small cage for my daughter's parakeet and the tall medium cage for my son's birds. I wasn't expecting such a huge cage, it's better than I expected and the price is unbeatable. Similar size cages run for double the price I paid. Amazing!! I was really unsure about this cage when I was ordering it.. But not that it is here. It is wonderful!! Easy to put together... I purchased the Medium and its HUGE! WAY bigger than I was expecting! You also have virtually NO MESS, your birds cant get seed all over in this cage because of how it is set up!. I love that!! I HIGHLY recommend this cage to anyone who has smaller type birds!!!! Really sturdy and our 2 parakeets love it. I would recommend wooden perches, but that is my only complaint. The best\u200b part is the high splash guard at the base. ", "Really nice cage. It doesn't say cockatiel,  but I got it for a young cockatiel and it is more than enough room for him. Easy to clean and keeps the mess in. It was a little hard to assemble, but worth it! Awesome parakeet cage. Birds are happy the size is huge big enough for 6 parakeets.  I only have 3 but easily could hpuse 3 more Really great for my 2 Indian spice finches.  It is well made and the price was right.  I like that I can remove the bottom to clean it without removing the birds from the cage.  I put the cage on the floor,  unlatch the bottom, then lift cage and set it down on floor also and the birds are still contained.  Great cage! Took a little longer than expected to assemble. I had to resort to YouTube but I am very happy with it This house is easily put together and taken apart.  It's very easy to clean and keep clean without taking the whole cage apart (unless you want to).  The best part is the seed barrier around the bottom.  I have 2 peach-face lovebirds that live in this model, and as messy as parrots are, this cage keeps their seeds off my carpet without the use of a cloth net seed guard.  If you have a bird that doesn't fly well though, I would recommend getting a ladder for him/her until they figure out the seed barrier.  These are great small bird/parrot enclosures that I would highly recommend! The cage is great for small birds like finches but my parakeets are not able to fly from top to bottom (too narrow). It was easy to put together but it does not have a pullout tray for cleaning, you have to take the whole bottom off in order to clean. Cage arrived broken, plus despite being advertised as big enough for a cockatiel, it is far too small to house even one. I was quite disappointed. The plastic bottom was flimsy, and for its price you could probably get something way better for your bird. Got this for two zebra finches. Lots or room for them to bob around. Lots less mess than their old cage (no seeds flying all over the floor). Easy to clean...lift the top off the bottom and boom you are done! Loved it so much got another cage for my parrotlet (different size). Cage was very easy to assemble once I figured out that the bottom Gris just snap onto acrylic base. Instructions not real clear on that. Have 2 parakeets in cage and they have loved it since first being put in. Like it so much that I just ordered the larger one for our conure. Cage looks good and is very roomy and so far keeping mess off my floors. I ordered this cage when I realized I had chosen the wrong size for us. The bars are perfectly sized for the smallest of birds and constructed well enough to hold up to all short of a hookbill capable of shattering plastic parts. I am using only the bottom and my lovebird is happy in the extreme, I'll use the top half if/when I get another bird...follows my other review: ", "It's a nice size and my two birds like it very much. I find it easy to clean and it did minimize the mess. This is hands down the best bird cage I ever seen. The design is perfect, and it keeps the surronding area clean. No more mess around the cage, no matter how much they fly and is very spacious. Great cage. Not hard to put together snaps together in about 15-20 mins. And I was working slow. Very large to allow birds to fly around and spread out a bit. Really a great birdcage. Easy to use and and clean. Though tricky to put together it is well built and the base is non-slip and heavy. Our budgie loves it. The perches and dishes are not cheap, they have substance to them and the holes in the perch let his feet breath. We bought the medium but the small would be fine for one parakeet. My sons two parakeets and two finches love it The cage is huge though easy to maintain. Feed/water stations are gaurded from above \"matter\" and are easy to change/fill. Sturdy cage. Plenty of room for my sons two parakeets. Surprisingly easy to put together (no tools required at all). I was a little sketchy about some of the reviews I saw and the pricing but I received it and it was pretty sturdy and great quality! I didnt really expect it to be as big as it is. Lol but I love it. More space for the birdies. This cage is perfect for our two parakeets - more than enough space, and they like the variety of perches. We added a few of our own, and keep their food in a higher bowl, as some suggested. We've had 2 birds starve to death, and I didn't see them locating the food easily, so I did to want to chance it! Not easy to clean and instructions unclear. ", "We have 2 parakeets in this cage. Plenty of space for them. The design of the cage is incredible. Highly recommend. Was really cheap for some time, Looks really nice and comes with a decent amount of perches. However, when I was assembling it I got confused a few times and the bars would bend easily. Great cage. Easy to clean. It's possible to detach the top and make it smaller....we do it for vet trips..but it's not the easiest thing to do. Would/will buy again once the current one runs it's course. The feeders on the sides are a little tricky to get in and out with those openings above them Very Nice cage for the right size Birds. I bought the vision medium bird cage for my two budgies and they absolutely love their new mansion. A big selling point for me was the horizontal bars so it is easy for them to climb. It is also so easy to clean. My yorkie also loves to watch the birds in this cage. I love it so much I got ANOTHER medium cage for my green cheek conure. He absolutely loves his new palace/jungle gym. I highly recommend. Love this cage for my 2 parakeets! Nice amount of space for them, can put lots of toys and things in there for them. Easy to clean a d keeps the mess inside the cage pretty well. I hated using the cage skirt thing, this being plastic at the bottom is fantastic. Works great for our two new parakeets.  Very easy to clean, just unclick the top and take out the tray. It would have gotten 5 stars if the instructions were more than just a few pictures. It took me about 2 hrs to get it together through trial an error. It is very sturdy and I can appreciate all the extras it has like the purches, and easy access doors for food and water. All in all it is a very nice cage for the price. I've been through a lot of bird cages in my life, and I seen this one and its what I wanted, plenty of room and most of all no mess.  Well all I can say is that, WOW, love this cage, easy to clean and no seeds outside of the cage, makes me a lot happier and my two Green Singer Finches love it, Thanks ", "Did a lot of research before getting my parrotlet his new cage.  Very happy with this cage.  Lots of room for him to flutter all over and food bowls on bottom so no mess outside the cage Love this cage. Easy to change out water and food. The only downside for me is that my green cheek conure climbs up on a perch to eat his food. So there is still a mess outside of the cage. Ill probably have to change the kind of food he eats so he doesnt do that. Fantastic cage. Rescued parakeet is living in it very happily. Incredibly sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. Really enjoy the clear bottom section of the cage - helps keep the bird mess inside the cage rather than out. My bird seems to love having a bigger space, and the cage was easy to put together. The only thing I wish it had was a tray that slid out from the bottom instead of removing the whole cage. But I haven't had a bird escape so it is not that big of a problem since the bottom is easy to remove and replace. None Purchased a few months ago for our new budgie--she LOVES IT!  When all the perches are moved to the sides she has plenty of room to fly.  We were worried she wouldn't know how to get to the food dish with the plastic in the way, but she scales the bars lower until she reaches the plastic and then just hops down.  For the most part, the design keeps half her feathers in the cage, but does prevent her from throwing seeds.  I've read that a wider cage is better, but I like this one.  Perfect for in front of a window! Easy to build and looks great My parakeets love this cage . Very well designed and built and very easy to clean up. Just a great product I actually use this cage for a baby squirrel that is being rehabbed. I had a different squirrel a year ago that ate through every cage we got him and this one has been amazing!! I have not had one issue and I've even had to travel with it several times! - I don't use the plastic perch inserts, but everything else is in use and perfect. - I will say that putting it together left some sore hands and fingers but the time it was done, but it has proven to be soooo worth it. Love love, love it! ", "Easy to put together, large and clean design. More than enough room for 5 parakeets Great birdcage, very roomy for my finches to fly. I found the booklet that came along with the cage the best way to assemble the cage vs. the quick set up, taking my time to check diagrams and text for details. I had no problems assembling it and found all pieces in excellent condition upon arrival. We have 5 finches and had them in a cage my husband's uncle built that, while unique and nice looking, was not very practical. I ordered this cage and was a little concerned because it is a bit smaller than what they were in. But the five of them fit just fine with plenty of space. I love how easy it is to clean and that the clear guard and low feed bowl keeps the mess in the base rather than all over the floor. I also loved that it comes with the food and water dishes and the perches. When we were shopping for a cage, I checked Amazon first and this was the first one I looked at. Out of impatience my husband and I went to Petsmart to see if we could find anything better that we could get that day. A significantly smaller cage with no add ons was nearly twice as much. Needless to say, we ended up ordering this cage and it was well worth the two day wait! Great deal, great cage! this cage was pure amazing!! really sturdy and a lot bigger than i thought. it stayed clean and was really easy to clean. the doors open easily and really easy to get your birds out. i really recommend this product for bird owners works great!! It is huge! We have a love bird and he is happy with his new cage though it took some adjustment; food and water on the bottom and the bottom is wired. He has adjusted and is happy. Very stupid design, not easy to change liner every two days, if you want to keep the cage clean I put this together last night and my four zebra finches love the upgrade! As for assembly, we definitely had to use the instructions, but it was SO satisfying to put together. Seriously extremely cool construction design. Every part makes so much sense. Love that you can take the floor grate out too. I\u2019m a big fan of this cage already! Easy to assemble and take apart for easy cleaning. Bought this as a gift for my mother and she says the birds love it! We have two cockatielsan d they love how spacious it is, even for a medium sized cage. The price works well for the quality of this cage and the sheilds at the bottom keep the area a little bit more clean. Great price for the size of this cage, my birds love it ", "Fits the space we had available perfectly. High Quality and a little unusual. I have three budgies in mine. Lifting the case to clean it is not a problem. Almost zero mess as long as the food and treats are located low in the cage. Had my 15yr old and his little sister put it together and they had fun doing it. Perfect size for my green check and no mess in the floor anymore! Love tb it - trick to put together but easy in the same time. This cage doesn't come with a hanger, but I added heavy duty mirror wire through the sides and looped it over the top.  Works great! Also this cage cuts back on the mess that these three beautiful birds make. Impossible to put together  Very frustrating. Anyone find a web site to help? good design = happy bird. My budgie loves her house. The horizontal bars, special pitches, room to fly, doors go inside or outside .... my list goes on and on.  Hands down the best cage around. Just finished putting the cage together. Found all the clips needed to hold the top of the cage on are missing. If it wasn't for that I would have given a better rating because it seems to be a nice cage. One of, if not the best cage out there. Assembly was easy and fast. Cleaning is very convenient with the bottom unlatching from the rest of the cage for easy access. My 2 lovebirds love it. My parrotlets love this cage. No mess to clean up each day.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  It was a little hard to put together but once we got the hang of it went smoothly.  We are able to put tons of toys in it. My parrotlets figured out within a day what they needed to do to get to food and water.  Great cage! It took a while for them to go to the bottom and eat but after they ran out of the honey stick or millet they figured it out. They seem to like it they're more active and communicate with my neighbors birds. Great cage,  and easy to clean. My gcc and i love it! Parts are easy to replace if you have crazy cats or other assistance in breaking a part. ", "Great cage for birds! What I like about this product is that the bottoms of the cage keeps a lot of the seeds in side while the bird is eating. Cleaning the cage is super easy. Easy to set up my parakeet (LunaBoy) like it. And I got the bigger cage for my cockatiel (Lucy). It's a good cage easy to access to change water and food. It's a really good cage and I recommend it. We bought a new dusky conure. Unlike simply sliding out a tray on the bottom to change the newspaper like other cages, you basically have to take this apart to do it. It's also a little flimsy. Very nice cage! Bigger than the pictures made it out to be.  My birds love it.  Easy to put together.  Only issue I had was one of the plastic doors has a crack it it. These cages are awesome.  I dont understand why folks rate this poorly because it has no pull out draw.  Thats the point!  The design allows you to enjoy your birds with very little mess.  If there was a draw - then it would be just another cage allowing down, millet and seed mess a place to escape.  Cleaning it is a breeze.  I have 3 of them - clean them every Sunday in less than 20 minutes for the three.  So,l if you are NOT considering this unique cage because of negative reviews concerning the \"no pull out draw\" - IGNORE THEM.  The only thing that can be improved upon is the size.  Regardless of the cage S,M or L series - they are designed for smaller birds.  Nothing larger than a Cockatiel.  I use the L02 for 2 pairs of Finches.  The M02 for a single Parrotlet and the L12 (thick bar) for a single tiel.  Id love to see an Aviary flight version.  If you are considering breeding - these are not the cages for you. This cage is not small, This cage is big! I researched every cage and was very pleased with what i received. My bird is one happy bird! The instructions were okay but putting together a cage is not difficult. Very happy and good quality product. We gave our budgies this cage as an upgrade from their smaller cafe. So far so good! Took the budgies a little bit to understand the new perches, but once they did they explored around. I like it a lot. This is my second cage, but this one came with 3 missing parts :(  Other than having to buy the missing parts, I love it! What an amazing cage! Wonderful Cage. Ordering another one. A little hard to put together at first but once you get it down it was well worth the trouble. ", "Our budgie loves her cage. We want to get a second for our new baby, sad to see the huge price difference between then and now. Four stars for the big price difference. Bought this as a travel cage for two caiques. Works well but too high to fit upright in the car. I have to tilt it a little. Also would like a handle on top but I'll figure something out. Otherwise, nice cage. Caiques don't like to eat on the floor so dishes which come with it are not practical. Awesome! Perfect cage . I use it for my canaries. This comes in different sizes. I ordered medium . Beautifuly made and very practical . Enough space for birds. Love it This cage is exactly as it looks! It's very tall & sturdy. Easy to assemble. My cockatiel loves it. There's a lot of room for all kinds of toys & it definitely is less messy than standard cages. Overall, great product and well worth the $. Just got this and it was sooo easy to build! The size is great! I really like this cage. only problem I have is my 2yr old broke 1 of the food tray doors and I'm having trouble finding replacement doors. This is a great cage. I have two parakeets and this cage is so big I could have more. They are very comfortable in it. Best cage and I tried a lot. I love this cage!  It\u2019s perfect for our parakeets.  The only thing I would change is if it opened on the top.  It\u2019s very sturdy and I love the look! Wonderful cage. Easy to clean if a bit annoying when I first put it together. Great for my ratties when paired with a sugar glider set. They can't squeeze out and they love climbing the bars. The food and water dishes lock in so they can't be overturned as well as side doors for easy refill. ", "I finally bought my bird a new cage. It is a huge upgrade for her considering the last cage was probably half the size. I love this cage. It keeps everything so clean because there are no more seeds flying outside the cage. It is also easy to assemble. Great cage .... very roomy. Very nice cage. Works great with our small finches. Nice sturdy. Instructions could be better. The cage is wide and practical, except for the floor; you'll need to remove the cage's base (white) in order to clean it up. I LOVE IT ! It's bigger then what I expected but I'm actually glad since I plan to have 3 parakeets it's super clean and very manageable. I would say it is , kinda complicated to set up but I not that good at putting things together but I still give it 5 stars!! Bird The vet office nor i could put this bird cage together. It seems ita missing parts. I need to return it This item is attractive but not so easy to put together or clean especially bottom as ther is not a tray that slides out. Came with broken dish door hinge the first time, now a replacement came and i see one of the bars is not secured at the corner attachment point.  I think i am going to look into other options.  Also i feel it really is not wide enough back to front for a cockatiel and lifting the whole cage off the base to clean the paper each day is a bit annoying.  I liked the clear part at the bottom for containing seeds and such, but the other drawbacks are leading me to believe this was not the right purchase for us. Perfect size and packaged great. Got here sooner than expected. My bird LOVES it. NO complaints. ", "Nice size cage for the price.  I love the fact that the bottom sides are high enough so that seeds and other food don't get kicked out by my bird.  Makes things much cleaner! The cage arrived exactly as it looks in the image, the birds seem to enjoy it. Used this for my sugar glider while she was younger. She loved it and was easy to move and clean. Plastic will get dirty and foggy quickly. Absolutely love this cage! I\u2019ve had the small one and medium wide in the past and my birds loved it. This one is definitely  worth the price, I got it for $35 since it was \u201cused\u201dand there is nothing wrong with it. The shipping was fast and the product came in good conditions. They took everything into account from healthy perches to overhangs on the food/water bowls so poop doesn't get in them. I love it and the fact it can transform into a smaller cage removes the need for buying a travel size cage. Difficult to clean, heavy and bulky This cage was packaged well, and delivered on time.  When putting together, I thought that a part was missing and they were ready to send out a whole new cage.  It turns out I did not need it, but their customer service was excellent!  Cage was easy to put together (about 15min) easy to clean, and easy access to the bird w/ the double doors that fold inside the cage and act as a perch.  Would definitely recomend Easy to put together and made cage cleaning VERY simple!  Loved this!! This is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, my two parakeets love all the space. It was easy to put together. I am not sure why there are so many reviews about the instructions or difficult scale of this cage setup as I had it together with ease and speed.  There were two sets of instructions though so it is entirely possible they have been revised to address the complaints. ", "Assembly was very easy and took about 20 minutes once everything was removed from the box.  Plenty of space for multiple birds. Love the setup. Instructions could have been a little better but over 1000% satisfied with product Great product, easily put together and No seed mess! Hands down best cage ever. completely thought out design all the way down to shields that protect the food from droppings! ll great item for any bird. mine is for my love bird he loves running around and climbing with all the extra space. Nicest bird cage I've ever seen. I purchased two of these cages, each for a pair of two parakeets. I love how it immediately reduced the amount if debris around the outside of the cage by almost 100%!  On set of birds adapted instantly and found the seed and water trays at the bottom of the cage right away but the other pair had a harder time so I removed the top half of the cage, making it half the height, and then they figured out where the seed and water were located. Both sets of birds seem to love the roominess of their new cages. The cages were literally a snap to put together. The first one took about 20 minutes and the second one took about 10 minutes to set up. Cleaning is easy. On a daily basis I use a dry piece of tissue to knock down any bird dropping from the perches or food covers into the grate below and once a week lift the cage off the bottom to thoroughly clean the grate and bottom tray. This takes a few minutes compared to the half hour per cage I was used to before. I will never go back to regular cages again!  These are so much more sanitary, droppings don't get into the food and water receptacles, and all of my birds love these cages! I noticed that a number of reviewers complain about cleaning this cage, but I went ahead and purchased it. I'm so glad I did. For the money, it's just fabulous. I opted to deal with the cleaning problem right away. So here's the deal, you have to lift the whole assembly from the base in order to get to the very bottom of the cage. Amazing cage! Perfect size for two (2) parakeets.  Thanks for the positive reviews that helped me buy this cage. This cage has helped so much with containing the bird seed. We have 2 parakeets and they like it. This product is amazing! The directions were straight to the point and the cage was essentially easy to assemble. It\u2019s the perfect amount of space for my babies! Nothing cane damaged and all parts and directions were included! It\u2019s a great size for the price tag! I say this cage is worth the investment great product! ", "I ordered this cage and it arrived damaged. The clear bottom plastic was cracked and would not support the metal sides. I ordered a replacement and that one was damaged as well and ended up canceling the order. Best cage. The budgies  love it and it is easy it clean and maintain! I love this cage. I think it is beautiful, and spacious, and a great home for my two lovebirds. The ONLY problem is that the upper part of the cage is not accessible. If my birds are at the highest perch in the cage I can't reach my hand in and up easily so they can jump onto my finger so I can bring them out of the cage. I wish that the top part of the cage had a door so I could reach into the upper part of the cage. love this cage.  It keeps the water and seeds in the cage and there is no mess to clean up.  It is tall enough that the finches can fly around and play. I love this cage and so does my bird. I have wanted a vision cage from the first time I saw one. I just got a cockatiel this Friday and thought that the cage already had would be big enough for him but it was not once saw the danger of having small cage I instantly bought this one. He instantly adjusted to his new home. Flimsy and hard to assemble. Do not recommend I read the directions but still had a little trouble putting it together. The cage is bigger than I expected, but no biggie as it was really light to handle. Good for smaller birds or climbing mammals. best deal.fast shipping, My parrotlet loves this.  It's her very own penthouse. This cage is perfect for my bird. It's light and airy. The top detaches easily from bottom for cleaning.  My favorite part is the clear plastic base below the bars.  My bird likes to take baths in a bowl and the clear bottom is a splash guard for my walls. I also love the 4 access doors! ", "I like the look and design of the cage itself and I think the price is reasonable. Cleaning and filling the food & water bowls are easy too with the wide openings at the bottom and easy snap on/off tray. Beautiful cage very nice you have no mess falling out of the cage plenty of room for birds very nice cage inexpensive$38 Kiwi loves her birdcage and I do as well since it is so easy to clean! Plus we love the four doors she can access to get in and out for playtime I almost did not buy this cage because of the reviews that said it was difficult to put together. I don\u2019t know if something has changed but my 11 year old daughter put it together in 30 minutes with no help and had no issues. This cage is wonderful. My 11 year old put it together with minimal help and no tools. The cage is very large and Perfect size for multiple birds and helps with mess! Really nice product, needed an upgrade for my budgie and now he\u2019s got all the space in the world!!! Also for the size of this cage, the price is amazing! We have two parakeets and they seem to like this cage better than their previous one as this one is larger and more space for them to fly. When you clean the cage, the bottom of the cage is open and the birds can fly out, but I have not had a problem with this happening. I usually lift the cage up and have it sitting on the ground before the bird even realize what is happening. I like how this cage keeps the food and poop inside the cage because the last cage we had, I was vacuuming every day because their food would spill out, even when I used the food container with a cover on it. The only issue I have with the cage is that the hinges that lock the cage together are not that strong and when you move the cage (or when your naughty cats knock the cage down) then the cage can come undone. We fixed this by using tie-wraps to reinforce the locks. This works so much better and I have not had a problem since doing that. The design of this cage is great. It has made a works of a difference when it comes to cleanness surrounding the cage area where as before with the other cages there was constant seeds and feathers on the floor. This cage has resolved this issue I liked the cage except I wish it had a pull out drawer for cleaning. ", "Great large cage! No more seeds and feathers on the ground. Great product product and cheap price. This bad cage can be used in two different sizes/ can be used only with the bottom half. I would really recommend it! Love that mess is to a minimum! Thought that I may not like the fact that there is no draw,  but I think the design is great. Just lift up cage and bottom is all open for cleaning. Has 4 doors 2 sets side by side.  I have 2 parakeets and they seem to like it.. one thing I would ghange is to make it a little deeper, its 25 wide  and 16 inches deep. But overall I really like it. it\u2019s a little difficult to put together the cage instructions are not very clear, overall the cage is sturdy i haven\u2019t had an issue with it after assembling it Item as described, fast shipping, Highly Recommend. A+ Great cage for my conure. Great quality and good size. This cage is beautiful, I love the look of it. The bad part is setup is rough and it is hard to clean since the bottom does not slide out. Cage doesn't secure to the base, difficult to put together as well. Bets cage I have ever had. I have a lovebird who just adores this new cage. It is soooo super easy to clean that I almost want to get more birds. :) I will never use another line for cages and will refer everyone to these. P.S The medium cage Is 3 ft tall, much bigger then it looks in the picture. My little lovey loves to hop from branch to branch for exercise in it and after 2 yrs, now sings! ", "Love that it keeps the mess inside the cage.  Easy to clean too. I love this cage. I have 3 finch females and they were so messy with throwing their seed everywhere. This cage has stopped that 99%.  I suggest this cage to everyone who has messy birds...... Originally bought the S02, but my wife insisted that I order the M02 model instead.  It's just great.  This is actually our 2nd cage from Vision... parts (ie plastic door locks) finally wore out over 3 years so it was finally time to get a new one. This cage is really cool! It's huge and gives my little parakeet so much space! Not too hard to put together and it's very sturdy. Awesome cage for any small bird! I had the Vision Bird Cage in small for my pair of finches, but when I added a canary, I got this double-decker medium. It's an awesome cage and the birds love it. They can really spread their wings. Well designed bird cage. Very modern and practical. Installation video would be useful in the future to make it easier. Other than that I highly recommend. Nice sized cage that's easy to clean. List of room for my two love birds. Best bird cage ever! No seed mess!!! Our canary is spoiled with this tower. Room to flap wings and fly around. Love it no more bird seed ever where! Building the cage was very easy to do. I did receive one of the doors to the feeder that does not close. I took a picture of both sides so you can see how one side is working while the other refuses to close. Is it possible to get one extra door sent out so my cage can be fully secure? ", "Once I got the idea of how it goes together, it was a breeze to assemble. Very nice cage with plenty of room for my 2 parakeets. The instructions weren\u2019t very clear but it was easy to assemble. Just snap everything together. New home new space new flying around techniques man my budgies are sooooooooo happy now, they at first were like at the top of the cage but now go all around and I am so happy they are happy :) definitely buy one of these for your lil birdies :) The best cage for small birds!!!! Great design, clean, modern, functional. I purchased this after reading the reviews.  It was better than I expected. Relatively easy to assemble, seems durable, good quality for the price..... This cage is perfect for our Lovebird and still has plenty of room for toys and for her to spread her wings. I'll look at getting another one if I decide to get another Birdy. Awesome cage, and it is extremely versatile.. an added plus is that my bird wont throw seed out anymore :) Very nice condo for our birds. ", "Me encanta esta jaula, mis pajaritos contentos, muy f\u00e1cil de armar, de limpiar y de mover None Super high quality and very nice looking when constructed. Very well thought out design that makes using the cage very easy and changing food and droppings out easy. I use it for my sugar glider and he loves it. Returned it Awesome cage. Good value, well thought out and happy looking.  We stumbled upon a sparrow that we rescued and soon we needed a cage. This fit the bill perfectly. It took a couple of days for my Parakeet to get use to all the space this cage provides, but now he loves it.  Great for him to get exercise! A bit difficult to put together, but my sugar gliders are happy to have this as a temporary cage when I visit my parents. My birds love this cage. They went from one of those little ones they sell at the pet store to this.they have been very happy in it and no longer show any anxious behavior when they are in their cage. Beautiful. Took little time to assemble but I got it. Birds love it. Easy to clean. Top and bottom double doors make it easy to get to every corner. 100% satisfied. No drawer to pull out to clean bottom of cage I got this for a pair of parakeets, they have room to fly and move around in. It does have a splash proof place where they can eat and drink without making a mess with the food or water! I think this was a good fit for me and my parakeets! ", "Best quality and enough room for 4 birds. \ud83d\ude0a Good size.  I like the 'lift off' design to clean the tray.  no floor mess with this cage.  shape of doors is unusual so it is difficult to use some accessories that attach to the outside of the cage, like birdbath, feeders, itc.  but overall, a good value and a nice cage.  finches have room to fly about a bit.  good for watching your birds. awesome cage This is a great cage my Finch family loves it. The two doors open to create a large opening to allow for ease of changing the water in their birdbath. It would be great if a side door or cutout for the nest box could be mounted on the outside. Also doors on the top would be great. BEST BUY FOR THE MONEY, easy to put together, just love it. Its like it was made for the spot I put it in in my home. The bird is happier and the area is cleaner!  Thank goodness The best! Stylish and comfy my birds love it We looooove this cage. Huge and get space for our bird. Good quality too.

The original cage I had had the pull out drawers that were supposed to be easier to clean - didn't matter, I still had to lift the entire cage off the bottom to clean. This is such a great cage.  It is everything it was advertised to be and more.  It arrived quickly, in perfect condition.  I would highly recommend this cage and vender. My birds love this cage. One of the parakeets learns how to open the door if you don't turn the knob the correct way. It doesn't click and lock Happiest my finches have ever been. I love the fact that they are not as messy with this cage.  It is a little complicated trying to assemble it alone. better with help. Super study and just what finches like.. room to fly! Great cage for our patakeet! But the perches are wrong - need to replace to wooden sticks (Birch Sticks) as I did. I already had the M01 cage and loved it. The M02 is exactly the same just twice as tall. The only downside is that it is a little top heavy when you carry it. Best cage ever! It is so easy to clean and maintains a very clean look. My birds love this cage. ( 2 parakeets) very easy to put together,  I did it all myself. ", "Looks very good, but its very difficult to clean. This is really nicely made - a little bit of a challenge to put together, but worth the effort for sure.  Our bird loves it, too! It is very hard to clean the bottom doesn't  have a tray to slide out We love this cage and so do our birds. It keeps more of the seed conatine and off your furniture and floors. I really do like this cage! Looks so modern and clean which is sort of my taste. Wife wanted to upgrade her two parakeets' cage without spending too much. The birds love it, it's so tall and spacious, enough for them to fly around. Why I didn't get this earlier- awesome cage. Much bigger than I had expected - only 4 stars because the birds broke the smaller version.  Birds are very happy to have more space!  We have two lovebirds in this.  And need room for a nest. I love it!!! It have good space!!! And is well designed!! There is a major piece missing which makes it impossible to assemble! cheap plastic and was broken when I got out of the box, such a shame ", "this cage is HUGE!

Very nice cage This is an awesome cage Phoenix just loves it we will now be able to get another Parakeet  . this cage actually keeps the mess in the cage Mess free! Seriously the best part. very roomy and I put it together myself (not usual for mechanically disinclined self).  it is a luxury for my lil lovebird!  no mess outside of the cage!! AMAZING cage!! My birds love it! Super easy to put together and even easier to clean! Way better than i was expecting, my parrotlet likes it and its just the right size, its easy to clean too. My bird loves it direction could be a little clearer took me longer to put together than expected. But it is a very safe and roomy cage It slightly difficult to understand directions for assembly but once together is a great cage. My two little paraketts has plenty of room to practice flying and exploring. lots of room to hang toys and treats. easy to change out food and the bottom tray wipes off easily. much better price online than in the store. Very satisfied I love the way the plastic guard around the bottom keeps those seed in the cage and not on the floor some who bought this cage didn't like the way u had 2 clean the cage but in my opinion this is not a problem the advantages outweighs the disadvantages. ", "Great cage, but..I wish is had a drawer too.  Now I have to carry this large cage into my kitchen to clean it. This cage is alot bigger then I expected but its okay cause I freaking love it. My 2 parakeets love it and have been bouncing around all morning. But save urself from frustration and dont get the free 3-5 day shipping, the box came opened and almost falling apart. Other then the shipping is a fantastic product!!! best best cage ever!!!! Very easy to clean! Perfect flight cage This cage in the box appeared like it would be too small until I assembled the entire cage and it is huge! I was apprehensive while reading reviews about the size bird that would be comfortable in the cage. I have a Quaker parrot and he has plenty of room to move, spread his wings fully opened, and his tail fits well within the cage without touching the sides. My bird chews on everything and can escape from anything, he has yet to destroy the plastic on the cage and cannot unlock his cage! The bottom is designed to catch majority of the mess and it does but not all the dander that falls from my bird. This is a great product, yes it's expensive but it's worth every penny. 10 minutes assembling My little birds love this thing it's the perfect size Absoulutley love it & so do our 2parskeets. Wonderful well thought out cage.  Our lovebirds are thriving and it has so much room.  We assembled it easily and the clean out process is a breeze! ", "Great cage for my lovebird Nice but assembly is complicated. Good cage, big and spacious. I like the doors which can be opened either inside or outside. It is a little hard to assemble, some plastic is too hard to bend and clip. Wonderful & easy to clean Bear to put together, took an hour:(. But she seems to like it a lot. Awesome Cage, keeps everything nice and clean. Great cage for smaller birds I've tried alot of different cages for my canaries and through alot of trial and error landed on this one.  The medium is only half as high as the double cage pictured, but it works just fine for my small bird.  Food trays are on the ground so there is no seed flying onto the floor.  The cages are really easy to clean, just unsnap the 2 hinges, pull the cage off, clean and replace. Lots of room for my bird Bottom of the cage came broken. I had to use it though because my other bird could open the cage my budgie was in. ", "Works wonders. My birds love it. \u2665\ufe0f Plastic part was broken. Although I have to use it cause it'll take  too much time to get a replacement. I ordered this  from  Korea. great my birds enjoyed all the free room to fly Great cage.  Keeps down the mess.  Birds love all the room. This is a great cage! Easy to put together and much bigger than I planned. Our little budgie LOVES it. Very smart design and easy to assemble. Everything we expected and more at a very fair price. This is a great accessory http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B5A8FK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13 This is a great cage. The parakeet belongs to my son. I hate the thing, but he loves it and I wanted to make sure it had enough space and was comfortable. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I bought the stand to go along with the cage and I must say it too was a great purchase. Bird seems happy and so does my son. Guess that's all that really matters I love that it helps with the mess of the seeds being scattered. Easily to clean! very nice cage roomy Would be nicer if it had a pull out tray for easier cleaning. ", "Keeps the seed inside instead of all over.  This is my second one. Yes...they could have designed it with  a pull out bottom for easy cleaning...but other than that, I love the cage...and my parakeets are way happier with extra room. Amazing my birds love it Very good cage for my cockatiel, and incredibly easy to clean. Very nice and the bird likes it a lot!  I love not having the big mess on the floor! Great cage we put our 2 parakeets in it they love it Awesome cage for the price! Great quality and much bigger then I anticipated. I love the design of this cage... so much less mess! Much larger than I was expecting and well made. I was satisfied with this purchase.  I received it sooner than expected, thanks to Amazon.  Set up was a breeze.  Like the practicality of the product.  Easy to remove the bottom with a one-two click, for easy cleaning.  Portable, so it's easy to move it indoor or outdoors.  Made the perfect choice, and I think my two cockatiels are happy too. ", "Good product.  Noted improvement regarding amount of debris exiting cage.  Could use a carrying handle at top of cage Great product! Well built with lots of room for my 2 parakeets. Perfect, excellent quality, amazing price, easy to assemble I've had the cage for a while. It's an auxiliary cage for our parakeets. I only use it during winter since my birds live in an aviary outdoors during nice weather. I do not like this cage. It is flimsier than I anticipated. One of the bottom doors has been knocked open by my birds twice. I hate that the food containers are at the bottom of the cage. I refuse to use them, even though they have a shield. My birds are accustomed to their food being up high. On a positive note, I like that this cage is larger than I thought it would be and that the mess is contained inside the cage bottom. It will work for us as a cage with limited use and/or as a hospital cage. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who has messy birds. All the seeds stay inside the cage.  Best thing I've bought for my parakeets. They seem to enjoy it. Love the cage , easy to put together . Had 2 missing parts and a broken perch . Or I would have given it 5 stars . Absolutely the ultimate bird cage.  For folks who don't get a bird because of the mess of the seed, etc.  this cage prevents all that and lets you enjoy the pleasure of owning a bird.  Absolutely perfect in every way. I am very satisfied with the product and my lovebirds are happy too. Thanks!! love how my bird have more fun in this cage than their other one ", "Quality cage, very sturdy and easy to clean. It was easy to put together.  The cage didn't work for what we needed which was an outdoor carry case for our African Grey. I found it easy to clean. I had questions sense the pan dosen't silde oout.  I just set it on a card table,  and unlock it much bigger than I expected--perfect size for my cockatiel--I thought I would use it for my little Linnie but the small size was perfect for her. I am very happy I got these cages---love how easy it is to keep them clean, to feed the birds. etc. they seem very happy. they also look very nice in the room--very streamline. I spent a while deciding to change to Vision cages and I will never go back. Very nice cage, Easy to assemble, Easy to clean Great no mess cage, well thought out and put together. My cocktiel absolutely loves this new home!!! All parts revieved in the box are light weight yet super durable - all parts are accompanied with snap/click locking peices.  If you can put Leggo together then this cage will be a cinch.  It took only 30mins to assemble with easy to read and easy to follow diagram instructions.  The mananger at the local pet store highly recommended and I am so satisfied!  I love that the enitre cage is light weight and easy to move arouns and easy to clean the bottom tray which just snaps off for easy rinsing/replacing liner.  I am so glad to have finally switched from a heavy, clumsy, cumbersome metal cage that the paint chipped off and the enitre bottom tray disintergrated outdoors - VISION is the WAY TO GO!!!!!! The directions for assembly  for this product where the worst I have ever seen. I hope the birds like the cage. Worked great.  Just what I was hoping it would be. This product is just what I had hoped for. Really reduced debris scatter and doubled the room my birds live in. They seem to like it very much. Well worth the money. ", "As a first time bird owner, I wanted a cage that would reduce the amount of mess outside the cage.  This cage is wonderful and easy to clean.  For the first month or so, I had to use feeder cups that attach higher up because my bird was afraid to go down to the bottom.  Over time I moved the feeder cups lower & lower until I was able to use the ones that come with the cage.  Now there is practically no mess that escapes the cage.  Not all birds can use this set-up - know your breed.  Hookbills do fine because they can climb down and up if needed. PROS: Perfect cage I will make this short,,,if your looking for a cage,,stop right here.you wont find a better one,,,,my bird loves it,,,,easy to clean,,,no mess on the outside of cage. Easy to keep clean and made in the USA I love my cages!  They are attractive and let very little seed out of the cage. It the right size for the birds Would buy again. Big cage. Absolutely love it. excellent it is ok ", "The box arrived all banged up and cut up.  One of the flaps that is supposed to close to keep the contents contained, was cut almost in half and was wide open with pieces spewing out onto my porch, the other was crushed and hanging open. great cage for our canary, she loves it. Although it is really big, a little wider would be fab, as canaries like to fly horizontally.  But awesome cage otherwise.  Love the easy access and no-mess design of the cage!! This has been the best home for our parakeets! Best bird cage ever! Very spacious and keeps the mess to a minimum. I love that there is so much less of a mess!  And the space for the price is awesome! ! my birds love it. My birds love this cage it's huge & I loved the price our local pet store was more than double the price for this exact same 1! Great bird cage for indoor and outdoor. Great product! Thank you! I love it!! Very nice size for my parakeets!! Bigger in person!!! Great price!! ", "The Bird Cage was better than I expected.  It's incredibly nice and easy to use.  Because of the way it's designed, my bird doesn't make terrible messes like it used to. I did have to have my son help me towards the end of putting it together but overall was a pretty easy set up.  It is really good size, I love everything about it and so do my parakeets. Came broken. Didn\u2019t even bother to box it up, came in box cage was packaged in. Should have had extra layer. Our 2 birds (parakeets) seem to like this much larger cage than they had.  They are much more active.  It is nicely constructed, and easy rto keep clean as it simply snaps apart from the base. Fantastic product for the price. Lots of room.  Easy to assemble.  Mess kept inside the cage!  I have four parakeets that are really enjoying the extra room and the ability to fly and climb about. It was a little tough putting together. It would been with directions Did my birbs a good home yes Beautiful cage.  A lot of assembly required but nothing you can't do in a good hour or less.  Plastic clips hold it all together at teh edges between panels so durability was called to question at first but once complete this thing is SOLID.  Due to the way the bars and doors work a lot of add on feeders and baths don't work too well - these bars run horizontally not vertically and the doors are abnormal sizes.  Once you work around all this it really is a fine cage and we wouldn't go back. ", "Wonderful cage. Keeps seeds inside cage. WOW! I have a small aviary and had originally purchased expensive all metal cages with the standard pullout trays. With four of these metal trays for the smaller birds, it was a twice a day challenge to clean seed and keep food and water dishes free of debris and fresh. I've admired the Vision cages by Hagen for some time now but could not afford them. With the special rates offered by Amazon, I've replaced all of my cages and the difference is like night and day! It is extremely apparent that a lot of study and careful observation went into the design of every aspect of these cages. Getting into the cages to clean is simple. The seed guards truly prevent even my \"messiest\" birds from sending seed and water everywhere. The food and water dishes have little removable covers to keep bird waste from reaching them - they work! My aviary is equipped with full spectrum lighting and these cages absolutely allow a great deal of that light to reach the birds. If you love your birds, take advantage of Amazon's deal on these feathered-friend habitats! They're so worth it! My parakeet love it super fast shipping, item exactly as promised So easy to assemble & the birds love it! Totally eliminates the mess on the floor. Worth every penny paid looks great and houses my 6 finches nicely. Highly recommend. Its a good cage. This cage is big enough for my two prakeets. They seem to like their new house. Excellent product. Not too difficult to put together. I think a happy cage for the bird (Canary) in this case. Splash guard at bottom is a life saver. I rigged the lower wire bottom so that it would stay with the stop in order to more easily facilitate cleaning of the cage. I use shredded paper, which absorbs moisture. Much easier than the sheet-a-day method, which is unnecessary as the tray is quite deep. Visually appealing product, as well. Nice cage for the money ", "Love this cage Love the cage! I have a parrotlet and he enjoys it's very much. Also look a lot better then my old cage. This tall cage is held together by plastic clips that fall off every time you touch them.  The shorter version might be ok but this double tall cage is dangerous for your bird unless you have no other pets or children or anyone who might touch the cage and make it fall apart. A bargain wortheverypenny Very easy to assemble and my two parakeets now live a life of luxury, considering another budgie as this looks  almost empty. The only thing I wish it had was a cleaning tray but isn't a huge deal. Was really excited to get this bird cage for our cockatiel. We just couldn't figure out how to put the cage together. The instructions were super unclear and weren't helpful at all. We tried following the directions and kind of built the cage but it seemed really unstable. Wasted about an hour working on the cage. Couldn't find anything about the cage online so we gave up. It's unfortunate because it seems like a nice cage. But we really felt like we'd have to modify it and use tools to make it more stable. Ended up returning it and going to our local PetSmart and found a much sturdier cage for the same price. I love it. No mess on the floor Love it\ud83d\ude01 Love it 5 stars Cage is good size. We have 2 birds, big enough for them but not too big. ", "Very nice. Just what my wife wanted but not for her birthday. Great size.Easy to feed and water. No mess from birds bathing. My birds love it, and so do I! Great for three to four budgies! Stays really clean, and there is lots of room to play Exelent The best cage for my birds!!!easy to clean,nice design,easy to assamble,perfect fit,so happy with this purchase..my birds are so happy !! very nice and friendly cage. easy to assemble Hagen revolutionized the bird cage.  I have had mine set up for one week with two parakeets in it..  Reduced the debris outside the cage by 90% !!  AND cleaning it was a snap !!  SIMPLE SMART EFFICIENT !!!  QUALITY PERFORMANCE DESIGN !!  My birds feel like they just moved into TRUMP TOWER !!!!  LOL  :) The cage looks fancy that's why I purchased it. Unfortunately it is not user friendly. It's very difficult to clean up because it doesn't has a pull out tray. I need to unlock both clips to take out the tray. THen, my birds will have opportunity to sneak out. Also, the feeding trays are difficult to take out for clean up... We have 2 of these.  The first one is the medium in regular height.  It's a pretty solid little cage, but seemed a bit small for our new little finch.  So we decided to get her this larger medium tall one. Seed stays cotained to cage I can't say enough good about this cage. I have had it for about a year and a half now, and everything is still in perfect working order.  It gives my birds enough room to fly, and it gives me enough room to give them a variety of things to do.  My only complaint would be that it is not easy to clean.  Unless I missed something  in the instructions, you have to take the whole top off to clean the bottom.  This is the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars. Other than that, it's great ! ", "I love this cage, my love birds are so happy, and have begun a family. Best purchase for my babies, and very easy to clean and assemble. Its a pain to clean. You have to take the whole cage off. If I had done my part in actually reading the product description and saw that inconvenience I would not have bought it. Great quality cage though. This is a great,easy to use and clean easy access to water n feed trays. Plus it comes with extra parts to expand/  Love it This cage is perfect for my eight zebra finches Really did meet the needs of my birds. Thank you. I agree with other reviewers who remarked that the dimensions for this product are much too generous.  The cage does seem okay, but not the size I expected for the dimensions given.  Also, the original box was quite beaten up before it was placed into a nice shipping box.  The plastic bottom of the cage is cracked.  Not at all the quality I expected. Pros: Cheap. Easy to assemble  Cons:  Cheaply made, bottom is thin plastic and access doors for the food/water containers broke very easily.  Save your money and buy the metal one. Cleo and Sapphire give it five stars they are very happy with all the room and I am happy not to have to vacuum the floor everyday the guard at the bottom is great. I purchased this cage for my 2 parakeets and they have never been happier.  They have plenty of room to fly around and play and seem alot happier. Not happy with the protection that I don't get from seed mess, I thought this would protect the place from the mess from the seeds \ud83d\ude10 ", "I received this item completely broken in multiple places. NOT happy at all. Had to box back up and return it immediately. I purchased this for my sugar glider. It is very cost effective compared to other habitats of this size and has no spaces that she can climb through. What a freaking nightmare to put together.. Instructions Suck.. Ugh My parakeet are happy.wirh their big home. I love it because it maintains the food inside and not all over the house. suitable for sevral small birds or one lrg. Wish it was easier to clean...cage must be lifted off the base. We researched cages and put a lot of time into it to make the best decision for our family and Parakeets.  We ordered 3 of the medium M02 Vision cages and are very satisfied with them.  They are absolulty a great choice for someone that wants a hight quality cage that looks good and best of all KEEPS your house CLEAN!  We also like the perches that came with the cage as they are ideal in keeping a healthy bird due to the varied widths they have.  (the varied widths aid in keeping the feet of the bird in good health in regards to foot problems associated with same width perches.) The food and water dishes are easy to clean and freshen up daily.  *Our 11 year old son put all 3 cages together and cleaning the cages is a breeze. *  We are so very pleased with our purchase of the medium Vision bird cage and highly recommend it to others looking for a great bird cage!!! Big enough, but expensive. Small, and unstable. Door killed bird. Whoever designed this cage has birds. Excellent! ", "My finches have neve been do happ as in their new home This is a Christmas present for my teenage daughter. Thank you. Abby is finally getting her pet birds for Christmas. THE MOST frustrating thing to set up!! There is no way this is easy cleaning!  No way! This item was received damaged and was returned. Was loving it until we came home one day and found one of the doors open and the birds out and killed by the cat and or dog. I purchased this cage (outside amazon) although I read every review here on Amazon. I was looking for something easy to clean and something that would contain the bird seed.  I read all of the reviews for all of the Vision cages.  Many reviewers complained about how difficult it was to clean.  I was also worried about the size.  I have five little society finches and my previous cage was long over 30\" and they would fly back and forth.  This cage was much narrower and others stated that the dimensions listed were incorrect for the actual cage part.  I saw it in my local pet box store and bought on impulse because I was so sick of cleaning my other cage and just had new floors and was sick of sweeping up seeds and stray bird poop.  On  Amazon I was looking at the LARGE since the dimensions matched my previous cage better.  At the pet store i just couldn't pay the price for the large but I wanted something right that second. I figured if it was really small I could easily return it to the store. I have now had this cage for six months and I would still absolutely recommend it to anyone I knew who was considering a parakeet. So why not five stars? Four reasons none of which are deal breakers. This is a very good cage but only for small birds.  The sizing is misleading as the measurements are of the bottom of the cage, it is several inches smaller width and lengthwise than stated.  I would not put any bird in this that is as large as a cockatiel or larger.  Cockatiels have long tails and this cage would not be wide enough to accommodate that.  However, for finches, parakeets (except larger species with longer tails), lovebirds and parrotlets, I think this cage is fine.  I am using it for parrotlets.  I hate that this cage does not have a tray that pulls out for cleaning, because it doesn't cleaning is much more of a chore than it need be.  That is why I have deducted a star.  I find it is sturdy enough.  The doors are large enough although very oddly designed.  I do wish there was at least another door on each side and one on the back for easier access (although the seed dish and water dish both have a door at the very bottom on each side of the cage).  I have a Prevue cage that is similar to this one except it is a bit larger and I have to say this Vision cage is far superior to the Prevue one in workmanship and sturdiness.  One of the best things about this cage is that the wires are horizontal rather than vertical, which makes it far easier for birds to crawl about the cage, especially if their wings are clipped, a poor flyer or if the bird is elderly. The bottom couple inches on the sides of the cage is plastic with no wires, so if your bird is elderly, a poor flyer or poor jumper, make sure you provide a way for it to get down to the bottom and back up again, such as a ladder or a perch that hangs downward.  Below are my pros and cons: I received the bird cage Thursday ..... Put it together put my cockatiel in it ..... I wake up Saturday morning to find him dead .... Don't know what happened but he was perfectly fine when I put him in cage ..... I am starting to think he couldn't figure out how to get to the bottom of the cage to get to his food and water dish.... I had noticed he had trouble so I put the wooden walk ways from his last cage and had it leading to the bottom of the cage along with a ladder ... I don't know exactly what happened ... I awoke to him making a strange sound and flopping around in the bottom of the cage and by time I got the door to the cage open and my hand in there to help him he was gone.... I had spent a couple hours the other day when I was picking a new cage for my cockatiel and liked this one based on the price and reviews ..... But I figured I would give people my story and hope it doesn't happen to anyone else. It's okay. The wire spacing and the spacing between the corners makes me uneasy. Where the plastic part meets the wire- there is nothing there to secure it if, say, a cat were to jump up on the table it was on, and knock it off, it could easily come popped out, providing space to free the bird. That didn't happen to us, it actually came out while I was cleaning the grime that was collecting on the plastic part. But still, something to consider. I like that the bars are horizontal, allowing our parrotlet to climb around easily. With it in half, he moves around more (since birds gravitate toward the top of the cage) so someone else may want to save their money and buy the shorter version. The bars under the plastic roof also make me uneasy, but Banjo seems to ignore them. Cleaning it is a pain, and upsetting to a bird who is inside- and not all birds enjoy interaction all the time. You also risk spilling bowls or hitting a bird with the movement of a toy if you don't first remove them or aren't very careful. It's a pain compared to normal bird cages with the sliding tray. We've had this cage for over a year, and the cage clean-up and risks just seem ridiculous compared to our other birds' cages. ", "I bought this cage after my kids begged for years for a pet. I got this one because I hate the mess. Years ago I had one with a pull out tray and food was always everywhere. This does contain the food. It doesn't fly out all over the floor. Now if they could just keep their poop in the cage... I've had this cage for about three years now, and while there are some cool things about it, I find it's a bit more trouble than it's worth. The seed catching bottom is nice, but it makes changing the papers on the bottom a giant pain in the ass. Not only so you have to lift up the entire cage and set it aside somewhere to clean, but  you also need to cut your newspaper/magazines/whatever into the right shape because the food cup platforms mean that the floor isn't  just a rectangle. Parts start to break a lot more quickly as well. There are a million plastic clips and pieces that hold this thing together, most of which have popped off for one reason or another over the year, lost to the ages. My boy also hates the plastic perches and refuses to sit on them, so I had to get him other perches, which are better for his feet anyway. Finally, the large plastic pieces on the top of the cage, and some on the sides, prevent hanging or attaching toys/perches, particularly from the dead center of the cage top.  So at the end of the day, I'm left here thinking, \"Why the hell did I buy this thing instead of a cage with simple assembly instructions and a slide-out poop tray?\"  The answer is that I don't know. It seemed new and innovative, but it fixed exactly one problem and created five new ones. Do yourself a favor and go buy a regular cage and a decent seed guard. Assembly isn't the worst, but a little tricky snapping everything into place, while worrying you might break all the plastic tabs. Pro's: This cage is kind of flimsy. Once you figure out how to put it together the assembly isn't so bad. But It's just flimsy! For example if you bump into it, the little fasteners in the corners have a very good chance of popping out. The wires of the cage are also kinda cheap quality and can dent/bend with little effort, ie if you're screwing on a separate perch. The green perches this comes with are awful. They're super slippery and my little conure freaked the heck out a few times trying to sit on them and nearly slipping off. The bird also doesn't really love these food bowls and prefers having his bananas/millet in the middle of the cage. Yes, it's neater because of the guard thing. But It's super annoying to change the newspaper or whatever lining you use! You can't just pull it out like a drawer. You have to pull the wire parts of the cage off the base, put the wire parts aside, and THEN clean the inside of the base. Such a pain in the butt. The positive things about this cage, though, are that my conure seemed to like it in general, it's big, and a great price compared to others. That's it though! I bought this a year ago for my green cheek conure; I have another vision model cage that we used to have him in, a short long one, that we were impressed with but he required a taller cage. So, we put a parakeet we have in the other one and bought him this one. My conure likes how tall this one is, but there isn't a lot of overall room for toys, I wish it had been a little wider. It works, is relatively easy to assemble, keeps the mess in the cage, and is extremely easy to clean; overall a really good purchase. None of the pieces were missing nor have any fallen off or gotten damaged in the past year. Just wish vision would make a model that combines the dimensions of this one with the shorter long model they made. Great cage for budgies! I cant say enough marvelous things about this cage. So well designed!!!  My english budgie loves it too! She loves to run around the bottim of the cage and look through the clear plastic!  She also enjoys the perches.  My husband assembled it in about half an hour. Took him Longer than most bird cages we have had...and he is a seasoned pro! The other great thing about this cage?? I wasnt sure whether to get the medium or medium tall version....and when i saw the medium version cost more than the tall...i figured well i will just get the tall even though im trying to hand train my budgie. (Smaller space easier to get her to cooperate) well...as my husband was putting it together we realized that the medium and medium tall take the exact same pieces there are just extra wlal pieces for the upper tier!! So, in essence...we cna get two versions of the cage for the lower price (which was the taller version m02) So, now after i train her...i can then add the second level and add another bird or two.  FANTASTIC!! I got this cage on clearance at my local pet store, so for the price I paid the value was amazing. I've had it for a few years. Originally, I had 2 zebra finches in it. They loved all the space and would fly back and forth. It's been awhile now that I have a canary in it. He can fly in short bursts. I staggered the perches so he can kind of stair step back and forth. He also likes to hang on the sides of the cage or on a swing I added. I think it's a very good size for him. I like the guards over the food and water bowls, and practically no seed or water escapes the solid plastic section at the bottom (so glad it's clear so you can still see him hopping around!) which I was looking for since the finches always made such a mess. However, after several years of cleaning this cage, I'm looking for something else. Okay this cage would get a 5 star if it was exactly what I needed. So for one, the cage is good at keeping the feathers, food and poop inside and not all over your floor. I love that about this cage. Also, there is plenty of room. I have two budgies and they love flying back and forth and climbing up and down. I don't use the small terra cotta dishes that come with it because it doesn't hold enough food and water for them it needs to be bigger. The BAD thing about this cage is you cannot hang it outside. I thought I was going to be able to hang it out in my patio. The strange thing about this cage is the gadgets that hold the cage together are sort of like snaps. Sometime they fall off even though I think I have them snapped together properly. If you want a secure cage because you have cats or other animals that may try to get your birds, this is not very sturdy if the cage should get knocked over. But, if you have no other pets and want a cage to keep in doors all year long then this cage is perfect.Because like I said, this cage keeps all the dirty seed, poop and feathers in the cage and your floor stays cleaner longer than any bird cage I have ever had. The only reason I don't give it a five star is because it is not a good outdoor cage. If you even try to hang it the snaps will come unsnapped and bye bye birdie. The measurements given are for the base of the cage. The actual cage dimensions are much smaller, roughly 22\" x 12\". This is okay for one maybe two parakeets tops, and only if they are getting out of cage time daily. Canaries or finches, which need horizontally will be miserable and it doesn't seem like a cockatiel could even stretch its wings unless right in the center of the cage. A parrotlet or lovebird might be okay but not a not of room for enrichment either due to common accessories being harder to use in this cage than traditional cages. ", "I love the look of the cage.  I can see my two lovebirds when they play on the bottom.  The lovebirds knew I brought a new cage home for them and they were so excited they jumped right in.  The Senegal also was excited but it's too small for him.  He didn't feel comfortable going in. I love this cage the approx 6 inch space on bottom where it's plastic had me worried but I made climbing ropes and other toys/ladders ( located in my online bird safe store). But after the bird got older he climbed right up like a pro. These bird's are smarter than we give them credit for and learn fast so don't let that space people comment about worry you. The cage in general is AMAZING I will briefly go over what I like and don't and why. This was my least favorite cage. As a new budgie owner, we purchased this one for my son\u2019s new pet - wanting a larger size since most parakeet cages are very small. It\u2019s not that sturdy and we had issues with the clamps attaching the cage to the bottom tray. The included food & water dishes didn\u2019t have covers to keep poop/feather debris out and other dishes wouldn\u2019t work with this cage. Cleaning was the worst, ended up going with a cage that had a slide out tray. Product, though delayed, arrived in wonderful condition. I had asked for the item to be packed in a Amazon box as I've read reviews of cages arriving broken. Set up took around an hour. Though confounded at first, I quickly was able to connect the dots and understand how to build the cage (my 11 year old brother helped me vehemently with it). The size is gargantuan; despite seeing the pictures of the cage here online a myriad of times, I honestly wasn't ready for it in real life. Depending on how well you set up the cage, it'll not be sturdy. I had to go back numerous times and fix the 'locks'. The only thing I so far have a love/hate relationship is how the base and the cage itself are not in any way connected. The purpose of this was to be able to have a swift clean and merely pick up the upper half of the cage and clean the base. Which, as I said before, I have a love/hate relationship with. Overall, fantastic product. this cage has no pull out tray. So cleaning it requires you to take your bird out of the cage. So cleaning it is very difficult unless you have a hand tamed bird that you can let out and get back in fairly easily. Otherwise, I love the cage. great price , great design, and great size. Its just better for a bird that is already hand tamed. This cage is cool. I love the see-thru bottom. And I was concerned about the food and water on the floor. They add a \"hood\" for the food. Awesome sauce! And it's really roomy. Lots of flight space for my feather babies. It's worth the money. I went elsewhere, but it's a great cage. The instructions were a bit weird. I just did it off the pic. Not very heavy and it's big. I was thrown by how big. Wasn't expecting that.\ud83d\ude0a Its a beautiful cage, I thought it was going to be easy to put together it is not be sure you have extra time to put it together, made a big mistake, purchased bird before I put cage together, it's still not really complete, I have to purchase the small cage for a short time for a home for my parakeet so I can make sure it's together correctly one person can do this but two would be better, only thing I would change is not to have to take the cage top off to clean the bottom part. this is horrible... first, the one and only pro - the plastic guard keeps food things from getting everywhere, which helped a lot I got my first Vision cage for my Green cheek conure the Tall L12 and loved it. Though now that he knows the rules of the house hes out more then in it. Its easy to clean, great looking and I've found it to be very sturdy. I move it back and forth every day between the living room and my room. So when i got my new budgies I knew just the cage to spoil them with. With lots of room for toys  perches and a ground feeding system which is perfect for them I cant recommend the cage more. I love that i can take the whole bottom off for a good through washing every couple of days instead of just pulling out the tray where things always find a way to get under and around. My favorite feature has to be the horizontal bars on all sides finally. why cant more cages do this It makes it so much easier for young still clumsy birds to get around with confidence. I do admit the perches that come with it are crap though i would take away half a star for it but amazon will only let me take a full star And their better then the perches that come with a lot of other cages, and you can hang lightweight toys from them. I love the clear plastic bottom it keeps the seeds and feathers in, i dont bang my leg on it when walking arround, and i can watch my birds play with their foot-toys. If i ever get more small birds this will definitely be the brand of cage i use for them. I had this cage not quite 2 years before things started falling apart. The corner clips that hold the perpendicular sides together loosen over time, or maybe it's the wire metal sides, either way, not okay. BOTH seed/water doors broke (I'm an adult. It's not like I beat it up). And finally, one of the cage-to-bottom tray clips broke. That was it, I tossed it and invested in a larger cage. ", "Cage DOES NOT work for finches. They can slide through the openings. Spacing is too far apart. Description says suitable for finches. Very disappointed as it\u2019s a nice cage otherwise. I do not think this cage is suitable for budgies (parakeet).  I brought a new budgie home and placed it in the cage, the bird became distressed in the bottom and began slamming back and forth in the bottom until it was able to get to a perch.  The bird injured both wings and was bleeding.  It needed veterinary attention.  I'm not sure if it was the clear bottom that caused this or if it is too narrow and the bird had trouble flying upward.  I read that parakeets fly horizontally and perhaps it couldn't figure out how to move upward in that space.  I will be contacting the manufacture. i own this cage and decided to ditch it. it is not easy to clean. there is no try to pull out and clean. i scare my budgie every time I try to clean it. my budgie is NOT happy in this cage. Took a long time to assemble. Instructions don't help at all. I spent about 2 hours just to put this together. Other than that, its a good cage for cockatiels. I have 3 of them and there's plenty of room. I bought two M01 cages and the upgrade kit so i have an M02 right now. This one is a perfect fit for a cockatiel. Lots of space and wires for your cockatiel to climb. Great for containing the mess!!! However only suitable for one bird (parakeet). The Tall space is waisted on a canary since they really fly side to side and don't climb.  If you don't care about seed on the floor I'd suggest going with a wider cage for any bird. This one isn't as wide as it claims since the base is where they measure and that part is not accessible to the bird.  Don't put two budgies in here. They will fight!  I bought the prevue breeder cage and took out the divider and even though it doesn't contain the seed as well it's easy to clean and much roomier and a great value for the price.  Plus the birds can actually fly in that one. Overall, this cage is fine for one budgie. I just put my Vision M02 together, and I love it!  I have two budgies, and there is plenty of room for them to freely fly / move around the cage!  I will say that it took me a little while to put the cage together, only because I made a couple of errors at the beginning.  But, once I figured it out, it was a piece of cake!  For the price, I think that it's the best deal around! This cage is large. We have 3 parakeets in it with plenty of room. The clear bottom is nice, it keeps most of the debris inside. This cage is perfect. Well made. The only problem I had was it took me 2 hours to put it together. The instructions were terrible. I am very happy with it once I finally figured it out. It is big. I would strongly recommend this cage. I love this cage! First of all, I am using it for my hamster and not a bird. Hear me out. I built perches and made a two story home for my hammy and she LOVES it. Great, sturdy cage. ", "I have a little budgie who adores this birdie mansion. The horizontal bars are perfect for climbing, his main method of transportation since his wings are clipped. The food trays have their own access doors to make for easy cleaning and refilling. It makes me happy that he has so much room to play. Over all this cage is something I would whole heartedly reccomend! We have finches and wanted a large cage for flight.  This has been perfect!  Very easy to clean and get access to the birds inside.  It was also easy to assemble.  I have had it for about 6 months now.  Very glad that I purchased it. I got this for my two parakeets and they have so much more room to play around in . They're so happy and I love the easy access food compartments and double doors . I high recommend this cage!! Cockatiel struggles when trying to get her out the doors-they are small for her size. Also difficult to clean bottom of cage because have to disturb bird by removing all the wiring from the base to clean it. this cage is nice in that it has the enclosed area on the bottom for catching debris;(only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2) BUT, to change the paper in the bottom, or clean the grate, you have to unhook the cage from the base and lift it (toys, bowls, possibly the bird too)and have someone else move it out of the way as you hold the very heavy cage in the air! who designed that? I'd like him to clean my cage! the perches that come with it are nice in that you can hook toys to them, but they are too thin. it isn't that easy to put together, but not the most difficult either. Good size for  Budgies (parakeets), parrotlets, canaries, and cockatiels. Nothing more than a cockatiel can use the cages made by this company (Hagen), anything bigger would snap the bars. It's an OK cage.  Got the medium tall and there's plenty of room for my lovebird. The best bird cage I could possibly have owned. Easy to clean and adjust some of the decoration. Also, very durable as I've already owned it for more than half a year and it has still to show any signs of wear. Large cage Instructions are not clear and help nothing look at the box!!! Click the bars onto the clear base! It'll click onto it instructions say click but not to where!!! amazing cage instructions are horrible arrived on time and was in perfect shape!! This cage for your pet is grrrrrrrate! Great attention to detail from the perch to the feeder. Solid when put together. The only think I would suggest is a play that opens to the top, which is sorta easy to do, since I did one myself.  The other clear view cages do not hold a candle to this one. ", "damaged product the return cost me more than the actual bird cage easy to put together...Perch's are a little slippery and thin so i got my Green Cheek Conure some more and i just wish it opened from the top...but its a really good cage for the price. Nice cage to take care of small love birds, the cage is big enough for them to move around Easy to put together and holds together well, no tools required and my lovebird loves it East to build! And extremely easy to clean I love it ! Recommend it for first time bird owners makes life easier Watch out! Regardless of how it's mess-free, those plastic food tabs at the bottom are tricky to get off and on, especially for house sitters. Give good instructions on them, and show them how to do it, better yet get them to do it if you want water changed daily. i just bought this cage for my birds as the ad said 25\"x16\"x35\". the actual measurements inside the cage are way smaller 22\"x12\" We purchased this bird cage, after much research, and are very happy with it!  We have been using it for at least six months and there is so much less mess with this design!  It is very easy to clean and fill the feeders and as an added bonus, we discovered there are suction cups on the bottom of the cage so that it stays put and does not accidentally fall or get knocked off the table. We purchased the medium cage, which is plenty big enough for our two Parakeets. The best and prettiest bird cage I\u2019ve owned.  My seven lady gouldian finches are very active and look very happy. This is the best cage I have ever owned. It's a little tricky to put together but once its together your good. No mess from seeds flying out of the cage do to the deep base, easy to clean just unlatch both sides and lift. I highly recommend this cage. ", "Great Love cage and easy to build. Love this cage to hard to put together  bottom unnecessary... 5 stars for this bird cage. It's bigger than I expected so I got more than what I paid. Love to see my cardinals in it the cage looks a lot much bigger than the shown pictures I have owned one of these cages for many years now and here are just a few of this cage's best features.

I have to say this cage is stunning! Even better than pictured. Every one that's seen it is completely blown away by the artistry. One flaw that I have to point out. The ceramic dishes that come with are beautiful but not as functional as they could be. If you're a bird person, you know fresh water is a must. Also dishes are going to get droppings on them that need to be cleaned. The way to attach the bowls to cage is to turn them sideways to fit in the bars then twist them 45 degrees to put them in place. When the bowls have water and food in them there is no way to do it without spill. I have to put a paper towel in the water bowl to absorb it before changing water, and cover the seed bowl and hope I don't spill. Ideally, the clip that holds the bowl should have been removable or some kind of cap should be supplied to cover the bowls when turned to be pulled out. Bottom line, minor flaw. The cage is worth every penny, and by the way, it's half the price you'll pay at your local pet supplier. I'll just suggest getting different bowls that are more versatile. This is a lovely and affordable stainless steel cage.  As others have mentioned in similar product reviews it is a poor choice for any parrot of any size for some of the following reasons: Round cages make parrots crazy.  Any reasonably intelligent bird could quickly learn to open the sliding door.  Parrots require lots of toys to chew and explore and hanging those toys around this cage really ruin the elegant simplicity of this cage. This is the perfect cage for my conure parrot. We replaced a larger, bulkier square footprint cage that sat on a floor stand with this cage, which hangs on a ceiling hook. This is a beautiful cage and adds a touch of brightness to the area. Although this is somewhat smaller than the old cage, our cockatiel has adapted to it perfectly and has plenty of room to spread his wings. Hanging from the ceiling makes it much easier to clean under the cage than the old one on the floor stand. Cleaning the cage itself is relatively easy. The bottom tray is held in place by two fixed clips and one snap-shut clip - open the snap clip and the tray slides out easily. The snap clip on our cage doesn't snap shut securely enough to hold that area of the tray flush with the bottom of the cage, but no debris falls out. The two fixed clips seem to hold the tray well enough that there doesn't seem to be much danger of the tray falling out. As other purchasers have noted, the food and water cups are beautiful, but very difficult to remove, especially with water of food debris in them. We bought two other food and water cups that are much easier to take in and out and have wider access to the food and water. We still use the original cups for less messy treats such as broccoli so that we don't have to take them out as often for cleaning. Overall, we're pleased with this cage. I was apprehensive to purchase this cage because of mixed reviews but I decided to take the plunge. I purchased this cage for our parakeet and so far have no regrets! This is a lovely cage - so reminiscent of vintage cages. I have two parakeets in this and it is really nice looking. As for the idea birds don\u2019t like round cages I\u2019ve done a lot of research and it\u2019s really more about size and wing span vs shape of cage. I wouldn\u2019t use this for larger bird species, but parakeets, canaries, finches it is great. I did not have any issues with cleaning the bottom, no it doesn\u2019t have a tray, but if you clip the mesh bottom securely on while assembling it\u2019s incredikby easy. I got some covered seed and water cups that screw on to the cage between the bars, the seed cups that come with it are useless imo. I would def recommend this to other small bird owners I joyfully bought two of these--one for the small bird and one for the large bird.  When anyone sees these two gorgeous cages hanging side by side, they exclaim, \"oh, what beautiful cages!!\"  And it's true.  They are quite gracefully beautiful.  For beauty, I'd give them five stars. Much bigger than expected.  Very happy with the size. I replaced the wooden dowels with natural branches for my finch. I also placed a small bowl into the decorative cups for easy care. The fancy bowls are just to deep for my finch. I gave a 4 star because it does not have a slide out tray in which is rather difficult to clean the bottom of the cage. Very elegant! Love it! I bought this cage for our second male canary.  I wanted something smaller, because our other cage is beautiful but larger and takes up floor space. i live in a small apartment with a cat, so we needed a hanging cage for safety. this largest hanging cage i could find (DYNASTY) is about the minimum acceptable size for my smallish green-cheeked conure. his door is open and he is free to roam the majority of the time, otherwise it might feel confining. he doesn't seem to mind that it is round, he has a little hutch at the back for shelter. i regularly switch up the perches and toys to avoid boredom. i had to buy a carabiner to latch the door (it was tricky to find the right size - REI). the price is right for stainless steel which is very easy to clean. this cage is lovely and the hanger is strong enough to support its own weight, plus bird and accessories. it seems sturdy enough, but is definitely not a knock-around cage, and you should check the screws are tight. it would be hard to clean if set on a table, but as a hanging cage it is fine. the twist-off porcelain bowls DO spill when you remove them for cleaning, so i take off the bottom tray and pour the old water/food into a catch bowl underneath. i line it with wax paper.** not everyone would be willing to endure such a daily routine, but i don't mind putting in a little extra attention for the sake of aesthetics and safety. you should know yourself and your bird well before committing, but all in all we love this cage and it is working great for us as a functional hanging cage. (ps: i used an old skirt as a cover.) ", "I am very pleased with this beautiful Prevue Dynasty cage, which I purchased for my cockatiel.  It arrived superbly packed, in pristine condition, and was easy to assemble.  While I have seen some reviewers criticize this cage for its roundness and size, my bird adapted to it quickly and happily, with lots of chatter, singing, exploring, wing stretching, and preening.  Furthermore,  I have owned parakeets and cockatiels for decades, and I have never had one go \"crazy\" in a round cage.  The two beautiful porcelain bowls, which hang from the sides of the cage, work well holding water and treats; I place the seeds in a shallow bowl on the base grate to contain the mess.  As opposed to the clumsy, wheeled,  \"pet store style\" cage I used before, this cage blends well with the rec. room decor - and gives the bird more opportunities to engage with the family. This cage is absolutely stunning from the designs on the actual cage to the pretty little ceramic dishes, and the largest size (the dynasty) is quite generous for smaller birds. It\u2019s light weight while seeming relatively sturdy and the stainless steel is a healthy choice for housing birds. It was packed properly, and shipped/arrived quickly. I really want to give it 5 stars but had to remove at least one due to a serious lack of functionality. The bottom does not have a slide out tray, so you have to take the entire bottom of the cage apart to clean it, and it can be finicky when putting it back together, the door does not have any sort of latch so birds larger then a finch may easily learn how to open it, and finally the food dishes have to be turned sideways to be removed to clean/fill them, making a huge mess in the process. i found solutions to the later two issues, but the cage is always going to be a pain to clean, and since you have to tip it sideways a bit to reattach the bottom you really need to remove the food, water and probably your bird every time clean it. For now it\u2019s so pretty it\u2019s worth the trouble, but my opinion on that may change over time. :) It is a beautiful cage.  There is one fairly large door, that's it.  there aren't food windows so everything has to go inside, which then makes the cage a little cramped.  The beautiful top piece, for hanging, is no real help.  You can't hang anything inside, it slips to the edge, so I added 3 small eye hooks to the top so I could hang stuff.  As for the bottom, the cage  has to be lifted off the 'catch pan'.  My husband added 4 small guides so the pan so the cage will always go back true to center.  These were small modifications that have helped.  I have two parakeets and they seem to really like it.  Yes, I would recommend this one to friends while explaining what needs to be done :) Hi. I am not real sure I would recommend this cage. I was really excited to have it, but in the three days since having it, I have changed my mind and wanted to share with other why as to maybe prevent the same mistake: This is a very beautiful ornate cage and my lineolated parakeet likes it. It has exquisite detail and looks fabulous in my dining room. Various buyers have complained about it in the reviews saying for example, that you have to tilt the water cup to remove it, thus spilling the contents. Well you don\u2019t have to tilt the cups. I fill 3 Oz disposable cups with seed and water and they fit perfectly inside the porcelain cups.  Someone wrote that birds can catch their claws as the wires come together on top.  Well there is an engraved round steel plate covering the top so that the wires are not exposed.  To clean the cage you just flip a fastener so that the bottom comes off and goes back on easily. The bird is at the top on his perch while you remove the paper from the bottom. At first when I hadn\u2019t figured how to remove the bottom and fasten it shut again, I called Prevue Hendryx and they were very nice and walked me through it. Now it\u2019s a cinch!  One problem I had at first was that my arm wasn\u2019t long enough to reach inside the cage and screw in the top with my fingers, but a friend with longer arms did it for me. The cage has lovely little feet so that you can keep it on a table. It also has a beautiful hook on top so that you can hang it.  What does not work is when Amazon was selling a hanging pole along with the cage and a nice dark green zippered cloth covering. It doesn\u2019t work because the cloth covering can only be put on over the top and this cannot be done if the cage is hanging on a hook - only if it\u2019s on a table.  I also didn\u2019t like the hanging pole because it is black and doesn\u2019t match the ornate steel-colored cage.  In general,  my little bird and I are very happy with this cage. It is the best we\u2019ve ever had. Thank you Prevue Hendryx! I love it. The cage is so nice looking and very spacious for my Greek cheek conure. She loves it! Just a quick note, I saw people complaining a lot about the cute water/food containers. You twist them to get them out, but if you just push the bars a little open you can easily get the cups out without twisting/spilling anything. And the tray is hard to pull so my husband pushes it out and I grab it from the front. I\u2019m pretty happy. Cage is pretty in a pic but looks cheap and flimsy in person.  I could tell immediately it was a return item.  3 parts were missing, the finial (top part) was bent over, one screw/bolt still attached. Even if it were an okay cage?  This cage would be next to impossible to clean. Maybe someone could use this cage for a decorative item, but whomever designed has never had a bird. I got this for my 2 parrotlets - they're TINY and even they could bend this flimsy \"stainless steel\" with their beak if they decided to chew the bars.  The bars are, btw, too wide for finches.  This is the worst Amazon experience I've had. I should not even have to return it - it was next to impossible to get back in the box because of the finial the way they sent it.  There are pieces of styrofoam all over my living room.  RUN DO NOT WALK.  I've had birds for 40 years - but never a cage experience like this one.  No more PREVUE for me. We bought this cage as a secondary cage (the middle size).  Our main cage is larger.  This cage is a perfect fit for our formal enclosed living room.  We use it if we need quiet time for a few hours.  Wow! is it sturdy.  Pretty too!  If I HAD to complain, I would say that the feed/water cups, while beautiful, are not really very useful.  To attach/detach the cup you need to turn it SIDEWAYS to take it out.....so if you have water in the cup it pours out!  So, I just add a water bottle to the back side of the cage.  Over all, I really like this cage. This is a beautiful cage and comes with very attractive food and water bowls and perches.  However, the stainless steel in color only and even that is too silver to pass for real stainless.  I bought this so our conure could be out on the porch with us without his flight suit, which he hates.  It was a covered porch and was not exposed to rain, only humidity and the couple months it\u2019s been on the porch have been low humidity.  The cage is already covered in rust.  I would imagine, even being inside, being exposed to bird food, water spillage and of course bird poop, that this \u201cstainless steel\u201d cage would rust soon enough.  Completely misleading calling this a stainless steel cage.  It is NOT stainless steel. Love this birdcage, I upgraded my parakeet, he moved right in with no issues. ", "I would like to do a lot of compliments about this cage but  i will not -conceived design (food&wated cups not good at all),its beautiful but to small for birds and slide door is not big enough to put them water.Also,i would like to ask the seller Pack the cage in a plastic bag because when opening the box, the entire pinoplast out to be depleted within cells it took me 35 min to clean everything in and outside.The cell could be a little wider too. Looks like  that cage for beauty  only but not for the birds.I am not really happy with this .And my two birds same way.Previous  standart cages made them more happy. I just received this bird cage today. and had to write in. This bird cage is beautiful. it was packaged great with no damage. It was also very easy to assemble. I don't have a bird yet, but think I will put one parakeet in the cage, but it is large enough for two. if your looking for a well made cage that is still pretty, this is the one. Not sure about the cute feeders yet, but I will try to use them because they are so cute. Very beautiful cage. I get many compliments on it. I also have the larger version of this cage. The food and water cups are very poorly designed and you might as well throw them out. Reason being, you must turn them sideways to remove or install which causes what is inside the cup to spill inside the cage. The perches are ok but I also did not use them for the health of the birds feet. Birds should have perches that are variable thicknesses. Another tip: WASH AND WIPE DOWN THE ENTIRE CAGE BEFORE USE! The first cage I bought caused my bird\u2019s feathers to become grey from coming into contact with the wires. This grey color didn\u2019t come off and I had to wait for the bird to go through its regular molt cycle before its feathers were beautiful again. I learned my lesson after the first cage. After washing the second cage I purchased, there were no issues except for a discolored towel. Beautiful, well built, heavy. I bought this cage because my two female parakeets were bickering.  This cage arrived in less than two days.  We put it together easily even without using the enclosed directions.  The amazing porcelain food/water cups do say to turn them for insertion, but if you gently flex the bars in Between the two hoops that keep the bars spaced they insert without difficulties.  The bars are a little flexible.  I have just put my one parakeet in by holding her near the entrance, she flew right in and immediately began inspecting her new place.  She checked out her food dish and started eating within 20 seconds and took a drink without difficulty.  She then checked the entire facility out and started chirping with happiness.  The bottom tray I lined with some newspapers I folded to fit.  The bottom tray is easily put on with a clip.  I anticipate easy cleaning.  This is a solid built cage, stainless steel cage, if not abused will This is a very pretty and well made cage. The bottom pan it easy to remove and clean. My only disappointment is the feeder cups. They are adorable but you have to tilt them over to remove them and any water or food in the bottom spills out. I drop a paper towel in the water cup so it soaks up the remaining water first. And I don\u2019t use the other cup for seed. I use my no mess feeder and it works out well. I would still buy again and recommend this cage. My canary loves his new condo!! This item will wear down with each cleaning.  The wire pieces holding it together are junk and will break each time you remove the base for cleaning.  The bars were already bent upon arrival but the box was in perfect condition so they must have been bent before packaging.  The metal is thin, bendable and sharp.  Not a good product.  I will be returning and this is too bad since it was a gift I gave my daughter for xmas.  Poor kid... Wow most of the time I don't write review for any product but I need to do it for this beautiful and stunning Bird Cage .... is absolutely perfect, the details in the cage are magnificent, I didn't have any problem with the food cups. My beautiful canary is enjoying his new cage very happy. 100% I recommend this item ... I bought the stand too and is great ... thanks a lot :-) I'm a very very happy customer ... I'm trying to add a picture but I can't download it .... CAUTION: Just found my canary dead with his head inside the water bowl supplied with the cage. The cage itself is fine but can't overlook my canary drowned. Nice quality.  Nice elegant design/shape.  Mine hangs from the ceiling so the door is a bit high for handy access.  Especially good is that the wires are spring steel or something - my little amazon parrot bend the wires with his his beak, but they pop right back - that's GREAT!  I use it for a sleeping, cold weather, and occasional cage for a smallish Amazon who spends days outside in a big aviary.  The round shape doesn't bother him (there were some comments about that, but I've had hundreds of parrots over the years, and never encountered this aberration.  My assistant bought one for her pair of Budgies, and they are fine in it too. ", "Great transport cage! It is a very pretty cage for my canary however, the pretty bowls that come with it are a pain to put in and take out without making a bigger mess then the bird. I do suggest getting a feeder and water bowl separate. Also the bottom tray is difficult to remove. But all in all I am very happy with the bird cage Very very attractive cage. More room than I expected for two parakeets. Please excuse my terrible pictures I took of this beautiful cage because they do not give this product the justice it really deserves. All I can say is I love it and think it\u2019s beautiful...Just depends on your style/taste of things. But this is exactly what I wanted and more. Glad I purchased it and super fast shipping. It arrived the very next day! Very happy customer!! Absolutely love this birdcage! Good quality! We bought 2 of the large ones and they Perfect!  The food and water dishes are great!  The perches are a good quality! We house two canaries in each and they have plenty of room! This is a beautiful cage. Good quality and very elegant looking. Every detail is nicely done, from the perches to the bowls. It doesn't lock when you close the gate and my jardines parrot has already figured out how to escape so I have to put something there to keep it locked. Other than that I'm very very happy with this cage. Very nice looking cage, I like it a lot. They can for sure improve the assembling parts and the cleaning tray part. It\u2018s not easy to put together when I first received it and it\u2018s not easy to remove the tray for cleaning. However, I still like the fact it\u2018s beautiful and the size is perfect for my bird. this is a stunning cage!  lots of room for both my finches to fly around in.  i have it hanging from my ceiling with a long piece of hemp rope.  the food and water dish are tricky to get in and out but once you do it a few times its super simple and easy to do.  you just kind of have to push the bars a bit.  cage is well built and stunning...lots of compliments! Missing parts, so I couldn\u2019t put it together.  I bought it used (like new) and there was feathers and bird poop remnants on it.  Had to return it. I bought this cage for my tow canaries but unfortunately pieces were missed and I could not put it together after reading reviews from previous shoppers how dangerous cage material used is not safe for birds safety since comes with porcelain cups I have returned item and already was refunded thanks to Amazon ", "This cage is pretty to look at, but totally nonfunctional as a bird cage. The food and water dishes are ridiculous because they must be turned on their side for removal, and the bottom of the cage itself is not secure. I really wish I had returned the cage for a refund because I've never used it. Horrible cage! This is a beautiful cage.  I would purchase again because it is so lovely. It does have some structural problems. The way the cage attaches to the base is difficult and not secure. When moving the cage you have to hold from the bottom. Much more difficult to clean than my previous cage. Food and water cups are lovely but cannot be detached from cage without spilling contents. I would never hang from the hook as it is not that secure.  But, given those problems, it is still lovely. Heavy, beautiful but the removable tray is not so easily removable. We actually had to buy some spring clips stainless steel and modify them to attach the bottom tray for easy removing for cleaning. This being said still must lift entire cage if not using a hanger. The item is pricey and would say that this is better suited for design than function. Unless you are willing to modify it will be a total pain for every day cleaning. This is a beautiful birdcage... it's made well, high quality. Unfortunately, while I was traveling, my housesitter allowed my cats into the parakeet's room, and I believe it must've suffered a heart attack. I hadn't given birdie it's new cage yet, and I'm not getting another bird, so now I'm left with this beautiful bird cage.... garden art perhaps Gorgeous cage! It is a work of art. I am so happy with it! Yes, the absolutely beautiful water and food bowls are strictly decorative due to the mechanism used to attach it, but I am confident my hubby will find a fix! I never read or write reviews, but this cage just blew me away! BTW, the problem with the food falling out of the gorgeous porcelain feeding cups is solved by holding down a small mason jar lid or equivalent as you twist it in place so the food won\u2019t fall out! Easy peasy! Enjoy! Beautiful cage and roomy for a canary singer. Highly recommend ! Very well made & so pretty to look at! Did not have trouble getting the bottom pan in and out. The dishes are silly for water use but they look really pretty in the cage. I'm just not going to put water in them & buy something else. I bought the Medium cage & its a great size for my 2 finches they seem to love it. My husband was able to modify the top and put a swing in there. I like it, but don\u2019t like the fact that I am not a me yo look the cage door. In addition, it is not easy to change food and water for my birds without having to open the door( try to hold it open) and birds flying out of the cage. While the cage is very attractive to see but if you use it for live birds it is difficult to clean.  The bottom is not easy to remove and to replace.  The clip that holds it in place is very flimsy and it is awkward to remove the bottom for cleaning and to reattach it. ", "pretty cage for decoration, but terrible for birds. Cleaning it is a nightmare! It's so hard to clean because of the design. My budgies didn't like it and I can't even hang their toys in it, because there is no cross rails. They fall to the side. The cage is very pretty for looks. Well made and nice to look at.  My Lovebird seems happy and has plenty of room.  The only problem are the food and water dishes.  While they are pretty, they are not functional.  You have to tip them over to take them out, which means spilling water / food all over the bottom of the cage.  They are also too small and it was hard for my Lovebird to eat out of the food dish. Sooo many people told me this would not fit my two parakeets. It is certainly large enough for the both of them, food dishes, and toys/ladders. They can be easily let out for exercise. This cage is beautiful and functional. My birds have never been happier. Love it! This is a beautiful and sturdy birdcage.  Very easy to assemble (altho the screws to attach the hanger are TINY) and very well made.  I don't much like the seed cups but they are easily replaced. I will not use those food and water cups. I can see how a bird could slip into one and would not be able to get themselves out. So I bought safer food and water dispensers and put the beautiful cups, that come with the cage,  outside of the cage on display for all to see. This is a beautiful cage BUT the bottom is very hard and frustrating to take off to clean and then put on. Once I did manage to put the bottom back on, it was wobbly so I took it off completely and I wish I could return it and get a regular cage. Looks great but it sucks to assemble and clean. Feeding cups are unpractical I am using this as a day cage for my Green Cheek Conure (she's small for her breed). The cage is too small for a regular cage. Shes in this cage for maybe 2 hrs a day. The rest of the day she is in her open cage in the bathroom. The cage is beautiful and mostly sturdy. I would buy it again. This is a really lovely bird cage.  It is well made and has such an attractive style.  I wish there was a stand made to match it. The cage is very pretty, the birds love it BUT it is very hard to take the base off to clean. If you are an engineer you will do fine.  But  it is attractive!!! ", "Bird likes it  for one bird great one thing if you want a swing cannot do it  And there are round inserts you can buy on amazon  fit purfect I love the look, but the assembly was a bit touch and go.  Tiny screws to place in a very small and awkward place.  All in all it was a good buy. Hard to clean. Fast delivery Really nice looking cage my canary looks great in it. The bottom tray is not that difficult just take a good look of how it works line it up and push/bump it in and then secure the front. Great cage My canary loves it.  So much room for him!! I like the construction and durability of this product. It's a little difficult to clean since the clamps at the bottom are hard to remove. I would still purchase again due to the quality of the cage. I bought this cage for my green cheek conure to sleep at night. I hanged the cage in my room and put a little hut in it so he can sleep at night. we have really enjoyed this. It is a beautiful item I'd seen a smaller version of this cage & was thrilled with it.  However, it was before payday & I brooded a bit.  Luckily, I came on Amazon to see if it was available & much to my delight, not only is it here but I was able to get the largest one for about 75% less than the store's price.  The only downsides to this cage is 1.) attaching the finial is akin to pulling teeth with chopsticks!  Could they make the screws & nuts any smaller???  We lost 1 nut in a crack between my floorboards.  Lucky for us, they give you 5 screws & nuts when only 4 are needed.  2.) As another reviewer on the smaller cage pointed out; the seed & water cups are NOT practical as you must turn them upside down to remove them for cleaning & filling.  I'm going to steal her great idea & put little plants in them instead.  I also worry about their safety as they are ceramic, made in China & that increases the likelihood that they contain lead based glaze to 100%!!!  While using it for dry seed may not pose problems, using it for water, fresh fruit/veg or sprouted seeds does as lead can leach into it. Incredible, well made birdcage!!!  Buy this WITHOUT hesitation.  Prevue should continue to manufacture more bird cages that deliver style and function like the Dynasty; It's stunning.  Great product Prevue!!!!!! ", "Was looking long time, found, thanks! Beautiful and elegant. Does not come with ceiling connections. Have to buy separately. Arrived without any defects . I enjoy it This is the 2nd time I ordered it, I love it but the second one was missing the same butterfly bolt at the top- I\u2019m a lot OCD so I noticed it, but it it a great cage.. Excelente producto tal y como promocionan,,, lo recomiendo ,,, gracias vendedor  u Amazon por servicio adoro esta plataforma ,,mis rosacoles est\u00e1n happy thank youuu None I have bought many cages over the years this cage is a wonderful value. I was a bit worried about the tray design but it works flawlessly. Very beautiful and luxurious cage but I think a bit difficult to clean I still don't know but will tell you when I do it. But I loved it. Very pretty and easy to clean I love this cage and I think the lovebird does, too. I wish there were eyelets on the top where the screws are for attaching toys, but I will see if I can add some myself. Very Nicely made. I have (5) Love Birds and they love it... seems they are living in a penthouse! The Only problem I find is that the food bowls are beautiful but not practical. So you must get your own. Still will recommend this product. ", "Beautiful! Great quality!!! I bought two of these, and they are beautiful, and perfect for small finches and songbirds. The tray below is a little tricky to remove and put back sometimes, but it's not a problem. The little cups that come with it are rather useless for seed or water since they are more of a little pot than a dish, which is how my birds prefer their food and water. However, I use them for nectar, as the birds I keep drink lots of it, and the pot shape is ideal for that. I had to tighten the wing nut on the hanger because when hanging these, the movement from the birds hopping around inside the cage made the decorative ball rattle in a way that was quite annoying after a period of time. Mal me llego , le faltaron las tasas de adentro , y todos los tornillos de arriba \ud83d\ude2ayo estaba esperando mi paquete feliz y no llego correcto deben de revisar los productos antes de enviarlos None I love this birdcage.  It could be easier but then it wouldn't be as pretty. Stunning!  Great price!  I am not sure why some of the reviews said round cages should not be used for birds.  My canaries have done just fine in my older round cage and even had a clutch of babies!  I love it!!  Prevue makes great products. Great product! Beautiful cage. I really like it it fits two parakeets nicely. The only issuse is that the door will not stay open for them to fly in or out of during play time. good quality and easy to clean Perfect for our needs. My canary is also very happy with it. Very easy to clean and care for. Gorgeous cage! A lot bigger than I expected but my two parakeets love it! ", "Excellent I want to know how to send this cage back. I am not at all happy with the purchase. Please let me. Andrea Lewis andylynnlewis@hotmail.com You need to modify the bottom pan latches but it is worth it. Have 2 parakeets living in it. Love the shape! It came a teeny bit banged up(mostly because the metal used was not very sturdy), but overall it works and it's absolutely beautiful. I am satisfied. Beautifully well made. This is s very well made cage and receive many compliments Beautiful cage, love it! Have not had a problem with bowls that came with it, just put them close to bottom of cage, because they prefer to feed close to ground.  Also, have not had any problems with cleaning cage.  Happy with purchase. It's a bit tricky to get the bottom undone for cleaning. Also consider how it's rounded and lost bird accessories are made for a standard cage  with bars that are parallel to each other.  It's a beautiful and unique cage though. Great value for money. Had for over a year (inside the house) and no signs of rust. ", "Good quality, large, heavy, well-built This case is beautiful. The photo doesn't do it justice. Arrived broken, no mechanism to request replacement. Love the cage, unfortunately the porcelain dished both came smashed..... so sad. This cage is so cute .  I love how convenient is to move around . Gorgeous cage - pictures don't do it justice.  Very well made! My bird loves it. Beautiful beautiful!!! Great bird cage plenty room!!! Sturdy!!! When I ordered this cage, I had pictured it as a bit smaller.  Regardless, my birds love it, I have two small parakeets and they have plenty of room to move around, and stretch their wings.  Many bird people will tell you a round cage is bad for your birds, but my two are doing nicely in their very large and heavy new cage.  I am glad that it is as large as it is, It gives them plenty of room to move away from strange hands, should they feel threatened and nervous.  I have not made a determination if I would put anything larger than my parakeets or perhaps a couple of love birds in this cage as it is round and not recommended for happy birds. This cage is really beautiful, and so far, is sturdy and high quality. It was packaged very carefully. I just opened and constructed it yesterday - I will update this review if anything changes. A few critiques, even though as of right now I still think this is a five-star product: ~There is some slight discoloration on the top of the sliding door. ~The wires of the cage are somewhat thin and quite easy to bend, especially during transportation and construction. ~If you are planning to hang toys from the top of the cage, there is only about 4 inches from the edge of the cage where there is wire to hang toys from because of the metal plate that the handle attaches to. This means that the furthest a toy will be from the edge or walls of the cage is 4 inches. I have one budgerigar, or parakeet and I would not recommend this cage for anymore than two budgies. ", "it beautiful to look at but not functional... Cage is well made. Wooden perch was broken in half when received, but a little wood glue did the job.  It came with an extra tray clip that I used as a door lock by weaving through three vertical bars and snapping it onto the top horizontal bar of the cage door to lock and simply un-snap the clip to unlock. Highly recommend great item Beautiful bird cage very pretty and easy to clean! too big for my canary huge great item packed very well still i got it damaged had to be that way when shipped out.  the pretty cups to item one of the is marred with brown lines all throughout it. the stainless rod sides were bent and damaged cannot straighten  cost to much to return.  when you put the cups in the sides turn cups sideways took me half hour to figure it out  lol..  guess ill have to live with it item is heavy  it came very fast they got that going for it so if you dont mind the bent and flaws buy it. I think the cage itself is beautiful. Not terribly hard to put together, however I have to wonder if the designer has ever owned a bird, my conclusion is probably not. I purchased the cage for 2 finches who aren't very active do the size is acceptable for them. Design issues are no pull out tray, you have to detach the bottom because there is no pull out tray. There is no way to attach any swings from the top or toys so I will run a thin chain to attach stuff to. The most unthought out feature is the food and water dishes, they are so deep my tiny birds would only ever be able to eat/drink a quarter of its capacity without falling in and secondly it would be impossible to remove the feeding cups without spilling half of what's inside of them out. They are pretty but also useless. The cage itself is beautiful and a great price for stainless steel but could be better thought out where it comes to cleaning, feeding, and accessorising. I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on this cage. It looks like it would just be decor but it\u2019s so practical. ", "Large and Beautiful cage that is very well made.  You will not be disappointed. Such a unique, functional and decorative home for my parakeet! Love it.  Very nice and well built bird cage. Look nice Love the style ....  my  baby canary Abraham  Love the space to fly and play ! Perfect size cage for a Sun Conure The cage is beautiful as depicted, but it is not all Stainless Steel. There are important and big parts which are made of other low quality materials, which soon start to rust. Love it so far Just wonderdul love it Beautiful ", "Love it! Nice and well made cage - my wife loves them so we bought two! Love them ~ perfect size for my Parrotlet Elegant, well constructed. Nice cage Beautiful and very elegant cage! I love the cage so do my birds it looks great in my kitchen I loved \ud83e\udd70 love it, so do my budgies!! Love it ", "Doesn't look cheap, gcc loves it. Excellent producto! i love this bird cage !!! The cage is beautiful, however; the top was not sturdy enough to hang as the screws kept loosening. It fell, after I hung it for a month to be sure all was safe while waiting for my babies to hatch. Luckily no birds were inside. The bottom is easy to take off to clean, but it has to be hanging, otherwise you'll have to lift and clean. Also, the bars are horizontal, so birds can't climb them. This cage comes with 2 cups (one for water, another for the bird food), we had a parakeet who drawn in the water cup right away.  I would not recommend if you buy this cage for smaller birds, if you are - remove the cup as it is deep, narrow and with slippery edges. Just beautiful! Love my birdcage! Awesome cage i bought the DYNASTY (larger) version of this cage (see my review of that size for more details) and liked it so much i got this one as a \"travel\" cage. it is DEFINITELY too small for everyday use, but it provides a nice change of scenery as a kind of \"playcage\" at home, and is fine and familiar in a more manageable size for when we are visiting people out of town for a few days. We really like the bird cage, bird does too . Cage itself is nice. But the feeding dishes are ridiculous. Makes a mess taking and out. ", "Nice bird cage my birds just love it! Extremely hard to put the bottom on or removal for cleaning Conversational piece. Death Trap! I have 3 of these, just ordered #4.  I also have the stands to hang them from.  We added better bolts to hang the cages from the stands.  You need to hang them and then you can easily remove the bottom for cleaning (I do not bother to line the bottom with paper of any kind.)  I have 9 lovebirds, these cages are great! 2 birds in a cage is best, but you can do 3 or 4 if necessary (depends on how the birds get along, then you need more swings and maybe another food bowl.).  I use the little ceramic cups (both of them) for food.  I added a large water bowl which I fastened to the inside of the cage with a removable stainless steel bowl for water and birdie baths.  I added various swings which hang from the top of the cage.  I found an old fashioned plate hanger thing which I was able to clip to the underside of the steel plate at the top of the cage, (which I could then hang swings from, etc.).  Wonderful cages, easy to put together, easy to clean, and very pretty to look at! Nice cage but no way to attach bottom of cage to the body of it. Only one clip when there should be three. Clearly manufacturing defect. Unfortunately, I was so confident the cage was fine that I threw away the packaging before assembling it. It was recycling night the day I got it. Now I cannot return it or use it, not even for decoration. What a waste... i like this but bottom must harder better I really like this cage, however, I would have designed it (or design a newer version), with a full round pull-out tray (similar to the TBIR cages); it\u2019d be a super simple modification and make replacing liners and/or bedding a bit easier. Under no circumstances should you get a round cage for a budgie. They are vastly more dangerous than square or rectangular cages; bad for a bird\u2019s mental health; don\u2019t fit accessories properly, which may lead to injury or death; and are unanimously recommended against by all avian experts. I saw this cage being displayed at my local pet store and I couldn\u2019t resist it. I bought the longer, bigger one. The cage is stunning, made of stainless steel and very elegant. You won\u2019t see a wire split, chip or break loose ever. ", "This is much to small for even one small bird, and round cages are psychologically damaging to birds. They feel disoriented without corners to identify their territory. Also, their wings can get caught in the space at the top where the bars come together, and they can get seriously hurt in a matter of seconds. I know it's pretty, but please use this cage to display some nice plants, and get a larger square cage for your loved bird! Gorgeous! It's much bigger than I expected it to be. It's strong and sturdy. The ceramic cups are too cute! It's not only a great and functional bird cage, but looks great as decoration too! i have seen so many great reviews and then the bad make me question whether or not to get this cage.  My bird is a quaker parrot who is out of his cage the majority of the day and likes to go to the top of his cage and hang out and play.  I love my litlle bird and dont want to do anything that could harm him so i have researched and researched!! I have heard so many negative things about round cages!  I would like a safe and comfortable cage for my bird as well as a cage that fits my decor.  After reading negative reviews and doing research and speaking with my Avian vet and showing him the cage, i will say!  The expressions about round cages driving birds crazy, and birds dont like them are myths.  My Avian vet gave me the clear to buy the largest version of this cage.  Anything smaller would not be suitable.  I would only put one bird of his size 11 or 12 inches in this cage.  I suggest that anyone looking to buy this cage get the facts from a GOOD avian vet!  Size of cage is most important here not shape. Introduce any new cage gradually so the bird can adapt to it.  No bird should be just stuck in a cage all the time.  When your home leave cage door open so bird can feel free to come in and out.  He also spends time out on my patio where he is not in a cage but on patio table and play area.  I think multiple play areas are important.  Make time for your bird!  People don't Knowledgeable bird people have known for years that round cages are not suitable for birds.
