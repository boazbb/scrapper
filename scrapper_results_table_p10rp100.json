Held up very well, no wobbling or noise, held up to leaning on it, dishes, wine bottles - I definitely wouldn\u2019t sit on it however. Definitely happy with this table, although it\u2019s a bit heavy it\u2019s ok since that makes it more durable. I bought this table mainly because it folded up. I am going to use it to do craft shows in the fall, however, I am not sure I can use it for that, as many of the screws on it are not even tightened, and when I tried to tighten them, all they did was turn in place, so I am thinking that most of the screws have been stripped. And the table will not lay perfectly flat, there is a bit of a peak in the middle of it, which I do not care for. I kept it, because I needed it right away, but I do not think it is worth buying another, which I was going to do, because I feel this table is not as sturdy as it should be. I am only giving it three stars because I did decide to keep the table, but frankly, I am not sure it is even worth three stars. I have purchased three of these to use in art shows. They are a standard width and 6' in length. They fold in half and lock securely. They also have a heavy carry handle built-in but I find them a little heavy to carry so put all three on a dolly. They are handy though as they fold, lock and fit into the back of my small pickup. This is the real convenience. My only advice though..... when you set them up, make sure the locks come down to lock the table legs into place before you start piling stuff on them. I have had one collapse once because the lock was not down and in place. No fault of the design...my fault. I still really like these tables. Disappointed in quality and materials! Before we even got them out of the box, the horrible fumes outgassing from the plastic tops flooded our house. Two of us got headaches and one a stomach ache from the smell. Sub-par. We decided to purchase 2 of these tables although the price seemed high-- mistake, do not recommend this company due to their poor quality & TOXIC MATERIALS used in order to have CHEAP production costs. NOT what we need in this world. When I received it, the box was damaged and smelled terrible!  Then I opened it, the table smelled terrible, AND it wouldn't sit flat.  Even after I tried weighing down the middle where it folds, it wouldn't sit flat, and it was so sloped that my books were slipping off the sides... This review is for the \"Office Star Resin Multipurpose Rectangle Table, 6-Feet, Center Folding\" and not the various other sizes that I have no experience with. Good table over all, but the table doen\u2019t lock firmly in the unfolded position which makes moving/lifting it difficult because it will try to fold close (there is a latch but it still allows the table to start to fold close). We noticed (at least one) of our tables has indents/sags in the center of both sides of the table. It isn\u2019t super noticable but rain pools in those spots if it rains before/after we use the table outdoors.  The carry handle is very convienient but it sometimes dangles during use (but we try to remember to tuck it under under the table with included velcro).  The compact size when closed makes these easy to store and move. Over all, we\u2019re happy with these tables, with the biggest complaint being the tendancy for it to want to fold close when moving it/lifting/flipping it over making setup/teardown require two people compared to other tables which can be done easier with one person. Have had this table for 6 months. We used it as a computer desk. The table has sagged very badly where the computer is sitting. The product details state that this table holds 300 lbs.  This table has not held up and we are now unable to use it. We were told the warranty is already up. I'm not going to lie, this table works and functions just like a real table, I would recommend this to anybody who needs a table like object for placing things atop and/or using as a thing to do things at an elevated level above the floor. I live in a small apartment and occasionally have game night there, but I don't have a table large enough to accommodate 6+ people.  I saw this rectangle folding table and thought I would give it a go.  I received the product 2 days after ordering, and was pleasantly surprised as the ease of setup and put away.  Now I can have family/ friends over for meals and game night and we aren't crowded.  Table appears well made and fold up to go under my bed or in my closet.  It has a handle on the side, so moving the table is very easy.  It can be easily transportable as I was able to put this in my small Kia and transport it to my sister's house for an extra table.  Super happy with this purchase. ", "Product was advertised like new, but came all dinged up and not flat in center. Will not work well for putting large puzzles together as I intended. I would have spent a few bucks more on a brand new one had I realized this would not be in the like new condition as advertised.  Definitely disappointed.  Photos attached show opposite sides of the center & one of the far corners. Every time I need a table like this, the last one I purchased here at Amazon is either now a ridiculous price, or just not available.  So I've got several different \"flavors\" of these tables. This is a well built table and very study.  We easily loaded up the table with drinks, med to large tub of ice, and other items and there was no sign of a sag or give.  We didn't use a table cloth (which would have been a nice touch), but the table looked perfectly fine without one.  It's off white with varying dark speckles (size of a grain of sand) throughout here and there.  For a folding table, there is very little wiggle from the legs so it I had no concerns when it was bumped or pushed around.  We may need to add another, and if we do, will definitely order another of these.  Oh, when you first take the table out of the box, it is not apparent there is a handle, but there is one.  Found that out *after* we carried it to the location.  Even without the handle is was very manageable to carry with one person. Item arrived dented in the top at two places, creating an uneven surface. Also a screw fell off when we took it out of the box. Sadly this has to go back. The packaging is minimal and there seems to be a dent at the box corresponding to the debt of the table top. Two stars because of poor packaging and suspect material that was dented I ordered one for a craft fair , it arrived  marked up and looked used , most concerning to me was the way it wobbled back & fourth when fully set up . I  returned & replaced it with another Amazon was cool about it  but I\u2019m sorry to say  it too would not stand firm . Having some mechanical ability I found the problem , there are 4 rubber washers needed to fix this, they need to be placed on both sides of a bolt that holds the two rods that connect with the table, if your game that\u2019s the fix . I thought it over and while doing that noticed some other quality issues besides and decided against it. Again ,Amazon was quick to remedy the situation. We ordered these after returning another brand. These were much sturdier and worked great. One table had a dent where it folded, but it still worked so we kept it. The table is a lot darker than it looks in the picture. More grey in color. Didn't matter to use since we will cover it with cloths, but just in case you really want a white table, this may not be your choice. It folds up easy and is sturdy. It is flat when it folds out and is so easy to store. I would have given it 5 stars but the color doesn't match the picture and one table had a definite dent. If I had time before the event, I would have returned it for a new one. Folding tables tend to have a problem where the two halves are slanted and there's a gap in the middle, which means you can't put anything at the middle of the table, which is the place you most want to sit. in our ministry we use large tables for sorting donations and packing boxes for shipment. In the past these tables have been quite adequate. We just ordered and received four more tables but one of the four arrived with a very clear defect in the top. It appears to be a palm print or depression which makes the top no longer flat. Rather than return table we elected to keep it because the appearance is not that important to her work but we are not impressed by the quality as we once were. I'm not sure if the model changed or something, but despite some reviews, there was absolutely zero assembly required for my unit (purchased new). Appears and functions as promised.  Seems durable and like it will survive lots of use.  I appreciate the carrying handle. ", "Great puzzle table!  I've been looking for a while and this  Table fits the bill perfectly. It's wide enough, long enough and sturdy enough for everything that I will be using it for. It definitely will work for people to eat on it and do what ever you needed to do and small enough to store easily anywhere. It does have a little weight to it but that's what makes it sturdy and you can't beat the price. 5 stars from me. It got dinged a star for lack of protective packaging. The corrugated outer shell had been torn, and as a result there was a gouge out of the top. Treatment of the packaging is obviously out of the mfr.'s control, but what they could have prevented was that one of the leg-locks had been jammed up the strut so high it wouldn't engage. That was simply resolved with a hammer blow; all present and now correct. Table is dented. Very disappointed. I need this table for Christmas dinner. The table is everything I expected! I took 2 stars off because the company charges close to $10.00 more a table....totally my fault for not sending them back....we are in quarantine and I didn't feel like lugging them to the UPS Store! The table itself is good....look at other sellers an compare prices! Table itself is great, thus the 5 star review. Nice light gray color, heavy duty, easy to carry around and set up. HOWEVER! I ordered a second table from the same exact amazon sell page, sold by InHome, and instead got a COSCO table which was much flimsier and even came dented. DON'T BUY FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN AMAZON OR OFFICE STAR! Sure it might be a few bucks more but the real table is worth it. I needed rectangular table to set food for a backyard party so bought 2 of these but ended up using for seating in backyard as we had more guests that day. They did the job and can seat 6-8 people. They fold easily and one person can carry them with the handle. Just be careful like the other reviewers mentioned that there's a bend in the center but if you put table cloth its not visible and is sturdy enough We bought to host dinner parties in our tiny apartment.  This has been perfect.  It's on the narrow side so we can't load it up with too many plates and place setting but sits 6 people comfortably.  It's light weight and folds down thin enough to be stored behind a bed.  It's quite sturdy.  The locking mechanism on the legs keeps them open without worry that they will collapse and we haven't noticed any wobbling.  The handles are surprisingly helpful. I'm not sure what I could possibly add. I read others reviews. This is perfect for events and extra table space for company. Solid. Stable. Very sturdy. Portable. It is heavy so could be difficult for some to carry. I accidentally cracked the corner coming out of the box. I should have just cut the box open around it. I can deal with that since I'm mostly alternating between using it as a crafting space or with a table cloth for events and visitors. Thinking of getting a second table for my office. table had a big dent in the end. It doesn't sit \"flush\" when unfolded. I am using it in a workshop, instead of a table for get togethers. I was very disappointed in this table, but didn't want to spend the time or energy sending it back. I seemed as though it went through a war zone in shipping. There are nicer and CHEAPER ones at Menards, Walmart, etc!! For the money this is a really nice table. Set it up in about two minutes, and once set up, it sat on the floor perfectly balanced without any rocking. Also, the legs at each end are far enough in so you can get a chair up to the table ends and eat in a comfortable position. We needed an extra table for T-Day and with a table cloth and some stack chairs we have an immediate solution. ", "Received the table very fast but  has 3 damaged corners. I purchased four of these tables.  They are heavy.  The first time I set them up I found a black screw on the ground.  This happened again the second time I set them up.  I kept the screws and later found that they were used to secure the metal framework to the plastic tops.  I tried to replace the screws but found that they won't hold.  This is a poor design.  In addition, there is a latch that is supposed to hold the two halves closed when the table is in the folded position.  Again, the screws won't hold in the plastic.  They loosen easily and as they back out the latch won't close.  The tables are study, as long as the screws stay in place, alas that doesn't seem to be the case. This is just what I needed for craft fairs I have to travel to.  It's sturdy, but not too heavy, and easy to fold out.  It's collapsable and has several latches to secure things properly.  I was worried it would be dinged up based on a few reviews, but mine arrived in pristine condition! I received this Table back in December to use as an all purpose table.  It came in handy for wrapping presents and I will use it as needed for Ordered two of these tables thinking they were off white, but they are gray.  The legs are a darker gray, but the table top is definitely gray, not off white.  Bought off white tables from Target and for lower price, too. The tables themselves are sturdy, though one of them arrived scuffed on the edge. (but I returned both) This is a great table, and probably the best out of all the different ones my relatives have.  I can instantly recognize my table based on how flat it is compared to the others when opened, and by the darker color.  It's sturdier, and as a result on the heavier side.  I definitely prefer eating on this one than the others since it doesn't feel like it will tip over or slide away. This table is admirably serving its purpose for game night, and as an ad-hoc dining table for now (just moved).  Construction seems solid, but I probably wouldn't sit on it or anything.  Its also nice that one person can open or close this without too much fuss (super easy for 2 people).  I'm very happy with my purchase. It's a good solid table for the price.  I chose to use this as my home office desk, because it was hard to find an office desk of this size (I also considered building one, but got lazy).  The tabletop is a bit thick (1.75in), which doesn't allow me to use some accessories meant for office desks, but that's not a fault of the table, but my decision. This is a plastic table. if you are familiar with the type then you know they are prone to damage - that is the price you pay for a lighter table. This still has some weight, but is much less bulky then other tables I have. This folds, but retains a fair degree of structural integrity when properly assembled. It was sturdy and held up my heavy shelf display during a craft show. I paired this with a fitted polyester tablecloth linen and was quite happy with the combination. This is an attractive, sturdy table that's not too heavy to lug around. The carrying handle and the latch to keep it closed while lugging it around are nice features. With rounded corners and edges, it's good for clumsy folk like me, too. ", "This thing is extremely handy.  We host Thanksgiving at our house every year and this allows us to easily accommodate everyone.  We've used it the last two years for Thanksgiving and then again for my husband's crawfish boil birthday party.  Then it folds up neatly. I store it behind a little couch in the dining room, and you can't even see it.  My only issue is that it is a little \"peaked\" in the middle at the hinge, but with a nice table cloth and a centerpiece you can't even tell.  This is a great option if you need the flexibility of another dining table sometimes, but don't have a lot of space to store one. 'Ok' quality.  I am using two of these in my laundry room as a folding table and they definitely serve their purpose (easier to fold large blankets and sheets on a big surface).  However I noticed for whatever reason, the tables do not unfold completely flat (the middle where the joint is, will not open all the way).  Some areas which don't affect its performance were also a bit bent upon delivery.  You get what you pay for. Great table (I bought 2 myself). Product arrived--packaged well.  Set up was easy--no assembly required.  Product was exactly as described.  The center seam was flush and there wasn't a hump in them as some described.  Tables are a little heavy but the handle makes transporting easier.  Just a heads up--the handle is in the inside of table and you won't see it until you unfold the table for set up. I own an event company, and buy a LOT of tables. We hadn't found good ones until we found these. They latch well, they have handles, and they are sturdy. The only thing that would make them perfect is if they had wheels. Overall, if you have a need for tables, these are the ones that you should get. Ours have held up over the ones we have purchased from the Big Box home improvement stores (and trust me, they take a good beating). The latch alone is great on them- it secures on the top rather than clicking together. Excellent for several things. I use it to sew. Play card games. Plan budgets. Arts and crafts. Extra buffet table. Came damaged (dented) on the corner but it didn't interfere with the sturdiness and it was small enough that I didn't mind. It's incredibly easy to set up and take down. Stores nicely and the handle helps with carrying the table. Overall, very satisfied. Overall, solid table.  The legs extend and attach easily.  Our only complaint and it is minor is the latch that holds the table together when folded.  We've had to use some wd-40 twice now to loosen it up.  And since the table is plastic, the screws to loosen the latch doesn't really work too well.  But it's a table... it serves it's purpose. Bought this to use outdoors as a potting bench.  Most of the actual potting benches require you to stand up and I have hours of repotting to do.  I like the size, it is easy to hose off, dry off and put back away.  It could also be used to have a dinner outdoors just by throwing a table cloth on it, or what ever else you want to use if for. I didn't open this table from the box right away then two spots a corner and in the middle on the table top got damaged. It was closed to return window dates. Yes I should open it soon but didn't doubt...ugh... ", "I purchased two of these tables to act as a replacement for my giant desk I had in my bedroom. I wanted something that I felt safe putting my desktop computer on, but I could also easily fold it up and put it in my trunk when I move out. This table feels very sturdy, it's made of a nice, hard plastic. I feel very safe putting my desktop computer on this, and it's also very roomy. Table was received damaged in the center corners where it folds, the damage wouldn't allow the table to completely fold flat, everything else about the table seemed fine as far as function. The table top plastic is very soft for this price point so it wouldn't take a drop of much height to dent it up . It's a grab bag so be ready to file for a return if you get one of the lemons. I initially ordered two of these tables, then went back and ordered another.  I agree with other reviews....it does seem to bow up in the middle a bit.  I'm not sure if actually putting things on the table will help with that, but they are still a great deal.  We purchased them for a graduation party, and they seem like they will hold up well.  Big bonus....they fold up when not in use!  A great buy. So far we are pleased with this table.  It came quickly, just in time for a large gathering at our house.  Table seems sturdy enough to use as a worktable for our workshop if needed.  I like the fact that it folds in half to save space, and that it is less than 4\" thick when folded.  I also like the latch that keeps the table folded while being carried. (Have struggled before with tables that lacked that feature!)  This product is about the same size as an old fashioned \"card table,\" and offers a lot more useful table surface. Quite heavy. There are some advantages to having something this dirty to cook on and eat on. However it is so heavy that it makes it difficult to use for camping. I would think it\u2019s designed for use around the house instead. Don't worry that it will rot or rusted when left outdoor. It will always look new if you keep it indoor when not in use. I make it available for more companies and when we go camping or outdoor birthday party. I'm using this in my art studio, and it is a serious table. I had a little bit of trouble getting one of the metal rings to lock, but with a hammer it went into place no problem. Like the ease and functionality of this table.  Disappointed because the description states it's off-white.  Nope, It's grey! Love these. We ordered three for a recent birthday party but they have come in incredibly handy for a number of parties and events since then. I bought this table because I needed space to work on crafts! I was attracted to it because it could be folded up and stored in a small space when not needed. It's light weight and easy for me to set up and move around to wherever I decide to use it, but it is also extremely sturdy and easy to clean if I happen to spill glue or paint while I'm working on my projects. Unlike other tables of its kind, it supports a lot of weight without having to worry that it will collapse. ", "I love these tables, but am tired of having to return them because of damage in shipping.  I finally gave up and resolved to buy them from my local retailer. I love the table for it fits just right in heidt and width.  Now what I don't like, I have only used it two times and the one side of the table is lifting highter than the other side.  I need for it to stay flat on both sides, at the present time it is not too bad, but will it continue to lift as time goes on? This was a gift, sent to a friend in PA. She loved it, everything about it and said it would be around for a long time. A sturdy table. Her words, not mine. I hope she liked it as much as she portrayed she did! TABLE WAS RECEIVED DAMAGED ACROSSED THE ENTIRE END OF TABLE TOP WITHOUT DAMAGE TO BOX!  BEWARE My wife is a silversmith and we occasionally do show.  I have a GMC Canyon with a very short bed and lugging a larger table around was always a lot of planning and honestly caused us to pass on doing a lot of smaller shows.  I bought two of these tables and I can leave them in the bed of my truck(camper shell), along with our tarp and trolley and we are now ready to accept shows on a whim.  Our sales have picked up nicely. Perfect for our camper.  It folds in half and stores in our mid-tack area of our horse trailer.  Accompanied with a nice table cloth, we really enjoy having a table to eat at and have friends over to our campsite. I love this table. I purchased it so that I could have a large enough space to use for quilting and sewing. It has worked perfectly for me. I also use it as my study area. This is probably more like 4-5 stars, but for my purpose which is jigsaw puzzles, it only rates 3 because of where it folds together. Reviews said no hump in the middle. But edges do not fit tightly together and one side is higher than the other so table is not level in the middle. Smooth surface and very sturdy but I am disappointed because of the lack of close meshing when opened table is great but I had to carry it from my car to a picnic spot and it was a two person job only because there is no handle or appropriate indention to use as a handle.  I would return but already recycled the box.  ugh So happy with this purchase tired of having to borrow family members who don't take care of stuff and spending hours scrubbing just so it's presentable for my occasion just to return so the process repeats very counter intuitive.. So I bought this table and no renting out lol.. ", "I was running out of my savings and I couldn't afford a proper desk. This $50 table worked better than my last $300 desk I had to throw away after moving. I finally get the leg room I needed. I am 5'11\" and the height is perfect. I have two monitors, laptop, and several large manuals I use for work, it holds the weight very well. The surface is smooth enough to write on. Even after two monitors and fairly large laptop, I still have plenty of space. One the best folding tables.  I use the tables in a high school setting.  Easy to setup and store away in limited storage space.  Well made product for the price. I bought this table because it folds in half. When it arrived all I had to do was unfold it. Genius! Whomever invented this deserves a Klondike bar. Man, I could really go for a Klondike bar right now. Maybe I\u2019ll unfold my trusty folding table and eat one on it right now. Totally worth the extra calories. REALLY heavy table! I didn't realize this when I was purchasing it, though. This makes it difficult for me to use sometimes. It stands really well, though. Definitely need an extra person to lug it around for markets or something, though. Needed a cheap desk that was large and sturdy and this fit the need perfectly. Has two laptops, keyboard printer, little office drawer set, an office light, and a personal fan on it all the time and there's still room for other things to place on it. When I get a real desk this will be a perfect set up table for years to come. It folds up well and has a handle for easy storage and moving. I am satisfied with this purchase! Poor quality, uneven surface. Have had it for less than a year and the crack where the table folds in half is beginning to widen so stuff falls in there and get stuck. Would not recommend. Liked how sturdy it is. Pale gray color is nice when used with other tables (white). Needed one more table for event at church. It was cheaper to buy this one, have it delivered. Future uses are abundant especially when you just need one more table. I needed a table for my kitchen and everything was so expensive and I found this on Amazon which was similar to what table I had bought at Cosco. I am so happy I bought this table on Amazon it's now in my kitchen as my kitchen table. Is this high-quality it's sturdy and worth every penny.when I have some extra money I'm going to get one to use as a desk in my living room Absolutely love these tables! They are sturdy, easy to clean, and easy to set up and take down. They are a little heavier than I anticipated, but I think that speaks to the quality. I am very happy with this purchase. They held up to a gaggle of teenagers bumping them, sitting on them, and spilling things on them,  and looked as good as new after a quick wipe with a rag. I look forward to many years of use from these. I basically use it just a few times a year and then it works just fine. It is slightly wider than the non folding resin tables that I have which is also great for what I use it for. Easier storage than the non folding table. ", "After looking at many sites and many similar tables, I settled on this one for a few reasons: \u00a01) the fact that they fold in half since storage space is an issue, 2)  price, since it was very well priced compared to all the other ones I'd seen, 3) the stated sturdiness and size, 4) it had a handle, and 5) it was an Amazon Prime offer so i knew returning it, if necessary, wouldn't be a problem.  I received one right on time but something happened during shipping with the other one and there was a delay in receiving it...but they let me know right away and I received the next one within the week. \u00a0After reading many of the other reviews, I was sure to open up the pkg right away to make sure they were okay and here's what I learned: \u00a01) they really are very well built and sturdy, 2) they really are very easy to set up and take down, 3) there's a very substantial and sturdy handle and it even has a Velcro strap to tuck it up out of the way when the table is open so it doesn't bother the person seated there, 4) when folded, there is a little closure opposite the fold that keeps it folded securely and at first I thought it didn't work...I thought it wouldn't close...but with a slight readjustment of the angle of both sides, it fit just fine, 5) as others mentioned, \u00a0I checked \u00a0to make sure that it was even, that when \u00a0it's put together, both sides come together evenly so there's no sort of lip...and there wasn't,  6) like some others, I found the packaging was somewhat inadequate as two of the corners \u00a0were dinged ever so slightly, but I just hammered both areas with the wooden handle of a hammer and it looks just fine, 7) when opened, there are little rings to keep the angled leg supports straight (so the legs don't fold while in use)...you just slide them down but two out of the four (I have 2 tables, remember) were stuck...all it took was a good whack with the hammer handle again, and 8) the color really is gray...a light gray, but very much gray, and not off-white. \u00a0Overall, I'm very happy with these tables, \u00a0and I highly recommend them. This table is admittedly nothing flashy, but it is highly useful and exactly as advertised. If you need a sturdy, folding table, look no further. Nice little table that are easy to clean up. We take them camping and they work good for that. It's really a fine table for a picnic, or something in the garage doesn't fit a beautiful home This is a miracle table! Got it for my grandma for our growing family dinners. She uses it for everything! I don't know why we didn't think of a folding one all along. It stores easily and just being able to maneuver it makes all the difference. She loves it! It is easily trasportable and is very sturdy when I put alot of my belongings on it too. Great utility table. I use it as an extra table when I have people over and for kids birthday party. It's durable and easy to open/close. I have seen ones that are a little lighter and cheaper (by $10) at Costco, but I had bought this one already. I might get the Costco one over this because it weighs a bit less and easier to lug around. But overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Love that this table folds in the center without being wobbly.  It is sturdy, easy to clean, and takes up minimal storage. It's close to 2\" when folded and works great for kid's crafts or as an extra table for a party. I highly recommend it and recommend buying it on amazon so that it is delivered directly to your front door. Bought from Amazon - delivered within a week.  ***Warning said to make sure to check shipment from delivery for damages.  Too bad for me, I wasn't home when it arrived!  Huge dent on one corner where the table folds.  Did I bother to send it back, and go through that entire hastle?  NO!  I'll write the poor packing and/or delivery monkey poor handling off to the price of doing business.  Having said that, what's a dent worth?  The table was purchased for basement projects / extra table service for holiday gatherings (will be covered with table cloth now) and for outdoor backyard parties.  All this said, it is sturdy and functionable and what I expected - minus the crumpled corner. We purchased two at the same time.

Latch is a worthless design destined to fail and it did third time I folded table. If a folding table can't stay folded then its core function is a failure.

Will attempt to return it even though that will be a chore...lugging and loading into my mini cooper WITHOUT a handle! while this table is very sturdy and folds up neatly, the hinge does not allow it to fold to a completely flat surface (it is peaked at the center). I need it for some heavy items at the office, so it didn't matter to me, but if I needed it to be completely flat, I would have returned it. Lots of dents and defects on tables.  Would never order this product again ", "Had to return it, the table top came damaged beyond use. The table itself is fine, seems sturdy, and should meet our purposes. However, the packing slip had a net price of $38.49 and I paid $64.60 for the item. That's a 68% markup.

This table worked out great for my craft show.  It did have a few dings in it when it arrived and the center bows. I'm going to order another one. Quality is not good.

Very durable & sturdy...will end up buying more. Sturdy table but there is no handle.

Very nice, sturdy, easy to  set up. The quality far surpassed my expectations - the table can support an incredible amount of weight.  5 out of 5 I put my 25 lb computer ontop of this table and it bows in the middle.

The packaging is almost non-existant though and it arrived damaged, with 2 large dents in it, as descirbed by other customers. This was a gift to my father for his birthday and he would not let me return the table since the item is large and heavy he thought it would be \"too much trouble\".  It would have been, too much for Amazon not to correct for its customers. I would think with several comlaints on shipping that you'd change the packaging.  This item has so little packaging to protect it that any shift in a UPS truck while in route to be could damage the table.  Not good.  Fix it, Amazon! I will not buy another of these tables because I was very unhappy with the one I received. I paid $75.99 each for 3 tables, I found the same tables in Indianapolis for $34.99 ea. I do not mind paying a little more for the convenience, But $44.99 more for each table is a rip-off. So people, you can not trust Amazone for the best price. Amazone said I can returned them But I will have to pay a 20% returned fee.. Amazone I am done with you. Frank I bought this table from Amazon 5 years ago and have used it for my booth events. I like it very much. It is strong even on a windy day, it holds up very well. Folds easily and the handle is great for transportation. I needed another folding table and Costco happened to have sale on it. I got it but ended up returning it. I didn\u2019t like the handle and it was heavier than this one. I highly recommend it. I like this product a lot. The only downside I have for this is Amazon is charging an extremely high price. At Costco, I found out you can get this exact same table by a different manufacturer for only $30. I know that Costco is able to give extraordinary discounts because they do sales by volume and they only upcharge 5% from the manufacturer's price. However, I am disappointed that Amazon advertised this as a sale at $68 when it was really selling for more than half that else where. I can see Amazon might want a cut for shipping and such. This is a heavy object, but I think that it should state where the money is going to. I bought this years ago as a computer table. It's wide, deep, tall, indestructible, and cheap: room for everything, lasts forever, so four stars. But there are pokey bits underneath that can be real toe bangers if you don't wear shoes, and it does not damp vibration very well, so annoying rattles can happen from random stuff you put on top of it. It's not a bad table, but I think I'm either going to cover it with cork or just get a different one. This is a great table. I took it camping and its easy to clean and easy to pack. This model does not have wheels. It does have a handle that folds away so make note of that as you fold it up as the handle sometimes gets caught inside the two surfaces. It does not sit perfectly flat so if you are a looking for perfectly flat surface when it is completely unfolded you will not find that with this product. The legs are fine and sturdy but where the two tops meet when they fold out there is a noticeable ridge. For those that have trouble with picturing how large an object is I would suggest keeping a tape measure handy and reading the dimensions carefully. This table is fairly compact but it is certainly not comparable to a packet of peanuts. It breaks down easy and is light but it still takes up some space. Keep that in mind if you have a specific purpose for it. I've had this table for about 1 year and it works pretty good. I put a 60 pound DJ console on the top of it almost each week and even stood up on top of this table and it hasn't broken yet. I say yet, because now it is sagging in the middle and can hardly close properly. So it might be time to get another one soon. But I must say that this table is really portable because it fits in the trunk of a car and is not very heavy. After one year of heavy and abusive use, it is still standing so I guess you could say that it is worth the money. However, i wish it had more support in the middle of the table where it actually folds. We ordered 2 4' folding tables for trade show use, together with matching drapes. One corner came in dented but box was not damaged, we decided not to make a claim to avoid trouble, besides the dent will be covered up by the drape-table cloth. The top is thick and sturdy, fold in half which is easy to carry, not as heavy as earlier tables. Legs are a bit wobbly if you shake it, but that will do.  4'x2' is a good size as it does not take up too much valuable exhibit space, 2' depth is just right, cuts distance from both sides, the best part is the adjustment height which makes it higher than regular dining table height, thus easier for visitors to see the products on display, while people need to bend to see displays on regular height table. To rent a table in most convention centers costs $300-$400 a table.  We can buy the tables, use them, throw them away, still save hundreds of $. We also bought 2 more but made mistake on those 2, they are not foldable, we shipped all 4 to New York city for a trade show in NYC, we will use for the first time 2 weeks later. Had it a few months now, sitting under a carport, out of direct sun or rain and has about 60 lbs. of rock and driftwood on it, while I sort out pieces I want to combine for my artwork. So, it is handling this load very well, with no problem, no sagging. I am happy with the durability of this table. ", "In spite that this folding table is 6 ft. it's relatively easy to handle. It's constructed in such Made in China Junk. If I didn't need it so badly, I would have returned it.  The table arrived compressed in the center and minus a screw to hold the latch in place.  I had to drill a hole and add a screw in order to close it.  On the plus side, it is compact and lightweight.  If you don't mind finishing the job of the manufacturer, go for it! Nice table.  The reason I mark it with 3 stars is that it came with a broken part.  The slider that keeps the legs in place is broken for one of the legs.  It works fine, as long as I do not carelessly bump or move the table leg, for it would likely collapse, spilling and dumping whatever was upon it. My son likes building forts where he can hide from all of us but I was getting tired of cleaning up the chairs and everything else he was using to build the forts. I had the brilliant idea of getting a 6ft folding table to be the main part of his fort. When the table is fully opened and upright, the two tabletop surfaces do not sit flat. I would have also liked to see a lever or lock to hold the table from collapsing when pushed from one side. This table is very well constructed. I purchased it so I could place my DJ equipment on it. At first I was a little skeptical on if it would hold all of the weight and held my breath when mixing on it for the first couple of days. But to my surprise the table does not wobble and evenly supports the weight. Since I realized it's strength I've been using it for picnics, parties and anything else I can think of. Great purchase on my end, I highly recommend for anyone who needs a sturdy table that is easily transported. This table is sturdy and very reliable, we've used it for parties and now we have it set up as a temporary craft table. It folds easily and the handle is great for carrying around to art fairs. I shopped around for other tables but this is my favorite, other tables require multiple people to take down and have odd handles, this one is great for one person to move around. My friend has 2 Office Star 6 foot folding tables that I keep borrowing. So I thought I had better buy a couple of my own. These arrived and one does not open flat and the other jogs and is misaligned at the hinge so the edge of the table is not flat.  I am returning these and looking for the same table with no center fold. great table to have around the house if you want to play beer pong. You can then fold it after your party and put it away. It's light so you can easily carry it to outside or inside. We bought to use outdoors. Was as expected. Nice camping table. ", "This is our second folding table, as we purchased another years ago. They are the type of item that when you need it, you need it, and Thanksgiving is exactly that kind of day. It worked well and we look forward to many events and years when it will be of great use.

Very Quality, Study Table. One of mine arrived with a dent in the corner though; probably from shipping. These are very heavy; heavier than I expected. Perfect! Just what I was looking to get for an outdoor dinner party I'm hosting.  It came really fast, and there was no damage. My only complaint is that I just went to order one more and the price went up 20% since 4 days ago, but that is not the table's fault! Slightly overpriced. I ordered this to use as a portable work station for wood working projects.  I could not be more pleased.  The table is strong, durable, fairly light, sets-up and tears down quickly and easily.  I know not very many people will use this for what i use it for, but this is a really great product. ", "nice for  displays This table has been used on numerous events and travels.

Great buy. Good quality but a little smaller than I had hoped for. nice product... HEAVY This table is great for extra space needed for lots of guests. They fold up and away for the next time. Definitely recommend! I bought this to place computer monitors and accessories. The computer monitor tilts to the left or right depending on which side of the table I place it on. Keyboard, trackpad, and mice that require flat surfaces also had problems, since the table has curvature everywhere. ", "Perfect for additional work space. Great price for folding tables.

Very utilitarian and safe Although a well made table, it was delivered damaged. It looked as if it had been thrown around by either the delivery people or the people that shipped it.

I've long wanted one of these and as a physician have been well acquainted with them as a hospital staple. When I realized this was nearly identical to the institutional versions I'm familiar with, it was a quick decision to purchase. Set-up/assembly was pretty fast, just required a screwdriver. I've been using it for a month, daily (my computer is set up to use my bedroom HDTV as monitor) and have no regrets. Easily supports my Corsair K70 keyboard and Evoluent Vertical mouse (still mounted as they are in a Corsair Lapdog accessory, minus the pad). Ok, I just received this item and had read all the previous posts on it, so I was prepared, but what was written about this item didn't explain it properly. I will try to write a review that is completely clear and will answer any questions you may have. The Vaunn Medical Adjustable Overbed Bedside Table was exactly what we needed! After a two month hospital stay, we needed several medical supplies at home for my parent to transition back into daily living. This table made so many every day tasks easier. Everything from eating, to sorting medications, to having \u201can extra hand\u201d nearby for dressing, and more, it has all been easier with the use of this table. I not only recommend it, I highly suggest that anyone that is caring for someone with medical needs purchase it. It\u2019s a good size without taking up too much space, and it is easy to maneuver, and is strong enough for the purpose it is intended for. It is extremely easy to assemble. It honestly took me only a few minutes to have it ready to use. Assembly consists of attaching the tray and wheels to the base. The wheels snap into place, and they also lock if you need them to. There are a total of 6 screws to attach the tray to the base, and a small metal plate, and 2 bolts that make it secure to the base and tray. There is one small screw that is exchanged to allow the lever to adjust in height. It probably took me less than 10 minutes after unpacking everything and glancing at the instructions. I used a Phillips screwdriver, and tightened the bolts with a small pair of pliers. It was super simple. It is well worth the investment! It was the perfect choice! I bought this table when I was having reconstructive knee surgery, and I knew I would be stuck in bed for seven weeks.  It was easy to put together, maybe 10 minutes max. This could have been a great product but the visible crack in the middle of the table top eliminated that possibility. Seeing the crack was disappointing since the assembly was so easy and quick. There were other reviews that mentioned similar issues but I took a chance and ordered anyway. I figured mine wouldn\u2019t come defective. I was wrong it did. Bah I purchased this table to help give my wife more space and flexibility while she recovers from a complicated surgery. The pluses are that it is well built, works exactly like we expected, and is easy to slide in and out of the bed as needed.  The minuses are that it can get a little top heavy and unstable on carpet, and the assembly did not go well due to a piece that had become dislodged in shipping or during unpacking. None This table was perfect for our needs.  My 80 year old mother-in-law is in a wheelchair.  I bought this to put in front of her wheelchair so she could have her magazines, tissues, and drink available.  The size is perfect.  It rolls easily.  It is sturdy enough to handle everything she enjoys at her fingertips.  I did NOT want a tip top.  I knew she would tip it all the time knocking stuff off.  This one does not tip.  It is very easy to position it at different heights.  Just push the lever and it goes up and down.  Less than 10 minutes to put together.  It is sturdy and a good quality.  We are very pleased with this table and would purchase it again. I am updating a previous review. The table has been performing OK for eight months. It's not as solid as the rented table we had, but it has been working fine. The manufacturer contacted me and said a slight slant is part of the design. ", "This table is almost as advertised.  I would give it 5 stars, but there was one serious assembly problem and one discrepancy in the description.  My husband (85 yrs old) had no trouble with most of the assembly, as the instructions were mostly clear and readable.  However, one of the casters went into the base easily, two more required a bit of hard pushing, and the last one -- he spent almost an hour trying to get it in, was about ready to cut off the end, but finally inserted it.  In the instructions, there is a reference to putting the knob into the hole in the side of the tube.  Actually, it is threaded onto the end of the inner tube. Received box and no screws to put table together with. I gave up after an hr trying to find my own screws to use since I received table on the weekend- Instructions to small to read. Returned Original review on 3/14/2017, I rated 3-stars Table comes stuck in down position. There are 4 screws that say \"Do not remove\" There is one other that says nothing. You must remove the unmarked screw before the table will move. If you remove the other screws, the table is ruined and cannot be fixed. Everyone is right about the instructions. They are not very detailed and well thought out. Also, the diagrams don't quite match what the product looks like. Also, the rubber bumper was already coming apart from the wood laminate, which I just glued back on with some silicone. After getting it together, it works nicely for what I needed it for. A stand for my monitor in my training room that I could tilt at different angles. I received this product yesterday (15Aug2019). This morning I followed the instructions and put it together. Reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about ordering this and putting it together. I am NOT good at assembling stuff. In fact, I dread anything that has to be put together.  This table came today and it was a BREEZE to put together. The hardest part was opening the box!  I laid it flat rather than using \"this end up\"  I just organized the parts, and followed the instructions. All you need is a Phillips screwdriver and a wrench.  Putting the wheels on was super easy.  I didn't use anything but my hand to push them in.  They were not hard at all and took minimal effort. MAKE SURE you read the instructions because the two wheels that have the locks have to go on a certain end. The diagram will show you - just make sure you look at it. When it came time to put the legs on and use the wrench, my husband did that with me holding the bar. Other than that part, I could have easily done this by myself.  As of right now the table works, it goes up and down just fine and rolls across the carpet easily.  I am using this as a stand-up work desk, for my laptop. I could not be happier with the purchase.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat. It was well packaged, and arrived with no damage at all. Picked this item after researching others, reading reviews, and seeing that it was Amazon's Choice. The product was quite easy to assemble as advertised, however product quality was awful. Returned same day.  The table top once assembled was not level and inclined down from left to right. The table top also required quite a bit of effort to lower and raise, far more effort that my 85 year old parent could muster. Amazon was quite responsive in facilitating a return, same day. No idea how this product made Amazon's Choice. Top is not level. I bought this table prior to a recent total knee replacement surgery. I got it because it has a longer table than most in this price point. I put my laptop, which is not very heavy, on the end of it, and my medications and medication log next to the laptop. ", "The spring has so much tension that if you release the safety screw without any weight on it, it can cause serious bodily harm. I own one already that I purchased for my fathers room.  He is no longer able to sit at the dining room table so we would move his table from his bed room to the living room.  I thought it would be nice for him to have another one permanently at his chair in the living room which is adjacent to our dining room.  It is very easy to assemble and I did it while watching TV in only a few minutes.  I removed the black screw and replaced it with the chrome screw.  When I raised the table there was a loud retching sound.  Now,  I can't get it back down.  So I give maneuverability 1 star.  There is no way I can fit it back in the box so how in the world could I ever return it? This is my second mobile table from Amazon but of different kind. When casters are installed, table is about 27 inches high. I used it as my laptop table while sitting on the sofa and it is a bit high. The sofa chair is only 14 inches high so I wish I can still lower this table down to 24 inches but it is OK. Also, I use this table to hold plates and mugs of coffee while watching TV. There is a wiggle horizontally of about 1 inch arc for wooden table top. It does not bother me much but I think the inner rectangular leg can be a wee bigger so it seats firmly and snuggly inside the outer leg of this table. Well for this price, I guess I'm asking for much but is there really no better product in Amazon for this price range? I'll reserve my four-star and higher for a better product. Nice table overall. Have only been using a couple days but it works as advertised and is easy to raise and lower with one hand. The small table says it is supposed to remain stationary, however it has a plastic Handle to tighten it.  It was free moving and I tried tightening the handle.  It would not tighten enough  to  hold it in place.  After trying again the handle broke.  Now the small table just swings.  Also be aware the instructions are not accurate. When it tells you to put item number 9 in place it means item number 10, item number 10 means item number 11.  It took two of us about an hour to assemble just because the instructions were  confusing. I would return this but I hate to assemble another one. Hopefully they will read this send me another handle for that small table and tell me how to tighten it The good: Product was straight-forward to assemble. The directions are clear. I was disappointed. Followed instructions perfectly but the table top wobbled. I mailed the company who said it may be defective and to return it but I had already had it all together & discarded the box it came in.  For what it was worth, I decided to keep it. For about 2 weeks the table lever worked and now it wont even budge so its stuck at one height.  I dont have the ability to get out so it would be a major hardship to try to return it. I got this for my mom when she came home from the hospital. It really came in handy. It's a bit complicated to put together, but I figured it out just by looking at the photo. My mom's been using it for about 10 months now and here are some of my observations. If you have someone at home who is bed-bound, we highly recommend this product. After having the product delivered a SECOND TIME (first delivery made at night, stolen from outside our closed building before I could intercept package) I ran home to assemble this item as soon as it arrived. ", "I bought this table for my husband who is in a wheelchair.  He uses it beside his bedside, and to eat on sometimes.  He has not put anything heavy on it.  He doesn't use it daily for eating.  He has used it for 6 months, and it is severely leaning towards the floor at the end furthest from the support/height control.  The support bar is very short, and is located on one end of the table.  The frame doesn't extend all the way across the table.  I am now looking to find a more stable table that will last longer, and roll easier than this one.  Very disappointed in the durability of this product.  My advice? Keep looking, and definitely check the underneath support frame. Ok, my table arrived today packed in a heavy duty box with more protection inside for the parts. Frankly it didn't show any signs of travel except the label. You ask why I started out this review about the box and packing? I don't know about your delivery drivers but most of my packages arrive looking like \"death warmed over\"...gentle with my packages they are not! Kudos on manufacturer box! I watched the video before I purchased, looked easy to assemble. Time to put it together now that it has arrived. It actually took longer to unpack everything, get tools (phillips head screw driver & wrench) and read the instructions than it did to assemble table. Was impressed that assembly WAS as simple in person as it looked in video. Table rolled well across tile flooring. Moved up and down smoothly. No scratches, looked fresh off the assembly line. Table feels stable for its purpose of light weight items. I would not be scared to use with my laptop. Wouldn't use this table for heavy items such as my sewing machine but I didn't buy this table for that purpose. Overall I am thrilled with this table. Hopefully we will have many years of usage!!! I know that this is a medical table but I am using it as a minimalist laptop table! So please keep in mind that I am reviewing it for the purpose I am using it for, NOT as a medical table. This table is sturdy (for light items and moving about) and good quality. It adjusts easily. It was easy to put together. It\u2019s not as ugly as I thought it would be. I bought this for after surgery for next to my recliner. It did not fit under my recliner so I had to use it long ways next to it. My fault for not checking for clearance before ordering. I did roll the side table forward and back depending on if I was reclined, and it kept everything in reach at the perfect height. It gives a large amount of table space too so I had everything I needed close by. I was glad I had it. I had originally posted three stars for this tabe due to a bad experience with assembly and functionality.  The company contacted me and suggested that I might have received a defective unit and offered to send a replacement.  Surprisingly I received it the next day.  When I opened up the package I knew what to look for and found that the original issue I had with a rod that goes inside the vertical frame was where it needed to be.  It took about 15 minutes to assemble it and this time the table functioned flawlessly, unlike the first time, and the tilt angle of the large and small tops stayed firmly in place.  I guess I did get a dud the first time because this one is great.  I'm actually writing this review sitting in a chair with the larger top angled down with my ipad on it.  I am extremely satisfied with this table and I know that it will give many years of service.  I also want to praise customer service for being proactive in seeing my problem, contacting me, and actually fixing it.  Thank you very much!! Received this adjustable table Monday February 4 2019. I just put it together today Wednesday February 6. There were 2 problems. I purchased this for my husband who just had open heart surgery. Along with an adjustable bed (from another site). This table works excellent! If you're using this as a computer desk for your bed, be sure to consider 2 things: When I opened the box I first noticed it's a dark cherry like wood, not the light brown in the picture.  Whatever though.  Everything went well until I reached the part of attaching the base with wheels to the middle assembly.  One bolt (12) would just not screw in, neither bolt worked in the hole.  It seems the inside threads just mess up at one point, only allowing about 1 turn.  It stays together but I'm worried about putting anything on it at this point.  Really disappointed. It is strangely comforting for someone who has been to a hospital to see, and use, one of these in their own home. They are extremely convenient, serving as a sort of nightstand and as a dining table (in times of great illness, of course. Never out of laziness :D). This table is of a good size, is easy to setup, and even has these slightly elevated ridges on the edges to prevent things from falling off. My one real complaint is that it is difficult to lower the table once you raise it. To lower the table, you have to pull on the handle and push down on the handle-side of the table. And you have to push down rather hard; this is difficult to do when there is stuff on the table. Otherwise, this is a fairly good product and a great to have when sick. ", "Well the table was exactly what we were looking for.  Unfortunately I ran in to a near show-stopper issue during assembly.  When trying to mate the metal stand to the table base using the two supplied bolts, I discovered that the bolt holes in the table base did not align with the holes in the stand by nearly 1/4\"!  No way could I get both bolts to thread in because of the nis-alignment!  To remedy this problem I wound up having to drill out both bolt holes  in the base by 1/8\" using a graduated drill bit.  Once the holes were enlarged I was able to finally get both bolts to thread.  This was a small obstacle for me as I am the consumate DIYr had the proper tools.  However this may be a problem for others.  Once assebled the table is as advertised.  It's a tad wobbly but fine as long as you don't weigh it down.  Also, the wheels being relatively small don't roll well on our bedroom carpet. I just want to make a review to say this thing was perfect and some ppl that make reviews and give high quality products like this a low rating, just like to be petty and are probably already just miserable. I say this simply bc they post these videos about the tray being delivered cracked when thats not the company or products fault but definitely the delivery service or packaging of quality control. This is to rate the product itself in all its actuality not complain in a rage bc it arrived defective. Its not like the company and Amazon won't except a return a refund or replacement. It defeats the purpose of honest \"reviews\" of a functional product in operation. Its so annoying to see ppl do that and how do we know they aren't posting the pics of a broken item that they broke themselves but want to blame delivery on? This table is so not easy to break in just delivery alone so if it came like that, why even assemble it instead of put it right back in the box and send it right back after starting a return? Dumb. Table arrived quickly, well packaged and with all the parts. For those of you wondering about the instructions they were easy to understand even though I\u2019m not one to look at directions. All you need tool wise is a Phillips screw driver and a crescent wrench, or pliers, or the proper size wrench. Since I was too lazy to walk out to the shop and get any of the mentioned tools all I did was hand tighten the two bolts and finally found a #2 Phillips in my junk drawer. There is one shipping screw that has to be removed with the Phillips. It\u2019s at the top of the stand. Only remove that screw. Manufacturer even put stickers around the screws you don\u2019t remove. We constantly use this table all day long.  Easy to wheel around and move up and down.  Love everything about it EXCEPT for the WOBBLY TABLETOP.  It appears this is a common issue when looking at the reviews.  I believe it is inherent in the design.  The pole/stick that goes up and down needs to slide up and down.  Because of that, it cannot be tight.  This leaves space in the mechanism which make the tabletop wobbly.  The overall stand is not wobbly, just the tabletop.  Fix that design and this is a 5 star table. Was concerned because of bad reviews of opening package saying that the wood was broken, pieces missing, etc. I purchased these for my mama and daddy as they are getting older, 86 & 84, and thought it would make their lives a little easier and it definitely has helped them both.  They lov them and use them for everything!  Just remember when assembling them to double check the rod in the \u2018post\u2019 that the table top slides up and down on. It had came unhooked in both of ours also as mentioned in other reviews. Had I not read about that already, assembly would have been a much harder process looking for the problem. Since I\u2019d read that detail, we knew what the issue was and total assembly for both tables wasn\u2019t even 30 minutes combined. I love this product so much that I have now bought this 3 times. One each for my father and my father in law and one for my guest room for when they come to visit. If you have a parent or anyone who had trouble getting out of bed to eat I highly recommend this product. Super easy to assemble, sturdy and great product overall. Last weekend my dad sat on the couch and used this table to have breakfast and read the paper. Gives people with mobility issues options that are better than a flimsy tray. Adjustable heights are practical too. I bought this table for a second time. The first table was fine- it had some quirks but was the best one out there. But this one no matter what I do it kept tilting side ways, the main leg is cut at an off angle- the base of the post where it screws to the base of the bottom of the table base. It won't screw down flush. I keep putting something between it as a wedge but it won't keep. I bought it as a gift, and it is outside the return date so I am stuff with a $60 item that I can't refund. I'm happy with the table, works as advertised.  My only issue is with the six wood screws that attach the table top to the post.  They are short, and while appear to make the tabletop secure, leave me with the impression that I cannot put much weight on the unsupported end of the table. This table arrived timely.  I am a 70-year old woman and putting the table together was solely on me.  The instructions were simple, and it took me 1/2 hour to assemble.  It is a beautifully finished table.  My concern, however, is the fact that once it is completely up, it takes too much pressure to lower it.  This happened a couple of times and it worried me that it just might be stuck in the up-position permanently.  At one point, I feared that I might break the mechanics by forcibly pushing down to lower it.  I am hoping it is simply the newness of the table that this problem exist.  If this persist, I will be forced to purchase another overbed table from another company. ", "I actually assembled it myself in my mom's room at her new care facility! Trust me, that's incredible... Lol  If I did it, anyone can! I am just a touch concerned about its long-term durability as the screws went in so easily, they might pull out easily as well. The product came defective. The table height adjustment mechanism came broken. ...I wish all 4 wheels locked. My elderly mother likes to rest her feet on the bar from her wheelchair. The table slides on the tile floor with the 2 wheels locked. I don't know if 4 wheel locks would work but as it stands now I have to put a weight behind the table to keep her legs for pushing the table away. On the plus side, it's sturdy and easy to assemble. The base bar has the large holes drilled on the incorrect side (or, perhaps the caster holes were drilled on the wrong side ... same difference).  As such, the base could not be attached to the post without first taking my own drill and making the bolt holes larger on the outside/bottom of the base bar.  Insane!  My guess is that my product was not the only one manufactured incorrectly.  Beware.  I'll be avoiding this brand in the future. Very nice and well built table that was easy to assemble and very sturdy. This is a really useful table. It's pretty long and fairly narrow, allowing it to be moved through smaller openings. The vertical post is well offset from the center, allowing it to overhang a lot or a little, depending on orientation. The wide base is quite stable, and the wheels work well. The vertical adjustment is a little tricky and takes some finesse. Assembly is fairly easy, with two caveats. One pre-installed screw is only used for transport and must be removed and replaced by a very small screw. There are a lot of labels to identify which screw to replace. The wheels require a push fit into their sockets. This is a tight fit. Some care and some muscle is required to seat the wheels fully. I needed a rolling cart for a treatment room that I was setting up and thought that I would have to spend $200 or more for a hospital quality rolling cart.  This was a pleasant surprise.  While not quite as sturdy as the more expensive carts, it works well for my purpose.  It even rolls fairly easily on carpet.  I did have to assemble it, and the screws did not want to go in by hand, but as soon as I found my power screwdriver, it went together in less than 10 minutes. I may write more later, as we've just begun to use this table. First, it was rather harder to put together than others have said, though certainly doable. Part of the problem is that they give you a big parts list, so you think you need to use all those parts, when in fact sections come pre-assembled. Second, the numbers in the packet of one bunch of parts did not correspond to the number sin the instructions, but we figured out what went where from the pictures. Third, we are finding that the table raising feature is way too sensitive. If I try to move the table (roll it) by grasping the top, it will go up. I have to use the upright chrome part if I want to roll it. Fourth, the small fixed part keeps getting tippy and I keep havng to tighten the wingnut (or whatever that part is underneath!). Functionally, my husband likes it a lot, though sitting in his armchair he finds the surface a little high for using his laptop. He isn't using it as an overbed table, but more for eating, reading, and laptop use. I think if we could solve the few small glitches, this wil be a great table. When first assembled the mechanism worked easily.  After just a few height adjustments the mechanism stuck in both down and up positions.  Now I have to wiggle it until it finally gives way but it's really not functional for my purposes. This is a reasonably good product.  It will take a few tools to assemble correctly - a decent screwdriver and a metric box end wrench or ratchet set at minimum.  The table sets to fixed heights, unlike the more expensive bedside tables, so it may suddenly drop and inch or two when you adjust the height, so you will have to remember to push down on it right after you make a height adjustment so it won't suddenly move.  Other than this, it seems like a well constructed table and looks like a good value for the price. ", "I love it! I purchased this to hold my monitor and laptop at home due to back injury and then after having back surgery. I had to lay out in a recliner to work, and this table worked so perfectly for what I needed. And at the end of each day, I was able to easily roll my work station to the corner. It was super simple to assemble and is very sturdy. I highly recommend this table, it has many more uses than just being an over bed table. Husband/handyman assembled table and could not get one of the non-locking wheels to seat.  He offered to buy new wheels from a hardware store but this table was brand new.  Why spend more money to replace a defective wheel to find out if it was the wheel or the hole that was the problem?  Plus, the table top was not level.  It leaned downward  towards me about an inch.  I needed one that was level.  The shipping box was battered so I was surprised the table looked as good as it did.  If the wheel had stayed put and the top was level, I would've given it 5 stars but these defects didn't make it any better than average. I originally bought one for my husband, who is typically bed bound. He was using it to hold everything and ran out of room to use it to eat a meal or use his laptop, so we bought another for that purpose. We have found that it is easily moveable on carpet, which was one of its biggest selling points. I had been thinking about getting a bed tray for myself, but decided on getting another table instead. I have been very happy with my decision and even use it sometimes use adjust its height to make it a standing desk when I need to stretch out (I am 5'3\"). I would only be cautious about how much weight I would place on the table, as it is adjustable. There was one time my husband tried to use it to steady himself while he was standing while it already had his very heavy gaming laptop on it, and the table lowered because it was under so much weight. After we raised it back to its original height, we have not had any issues with it happening again. This table is durable, when used with care. I definitely recommend it! We needed to get a nice over the bed table for a friend in memory care.  We searched the local area and only found a couple of medical supply companies that had them.  They preferred to rent them out at $16/mo.  For short term needs that would have been okay but we anticipate a couple of years or more so we wanted to purchase.  These companies offered to sell us a used one for $100.  So this option is an outstanding bargain.  Quality is excellent.  When we delivered this to our friend other residents wanted to know where she got it so they could buy one. My husband and I bought this to help me in my recovery from neck surgery and it is perfect! The wheels make it easy to move, which means I can push it out of my way when I need to get out of bed. The height is adjustable, so I have used it in several rooms in the house. Admittedly, I can't carry it because my lift limit is 5 lbs for another few weeks; I can, however, roll it from place to place. Finally, the table stays put wherever I want it. It's sturdy enough that my cats (one of whom is really big) can jump onto it from the floor (I wish they wouldn't, lol). The foot bar on my mother's old table kept hitting the wheels of her wheelchair, so I could never get it positioned close enough to catch food spills. The foot bar of this table is deep on one side, so I can push the table closer to her making meal times a lot less messy. What I gained in depth, I lost in quality. This table is less sturdy and the lever that raises and lowers the surface doesn't catch with consistency, so you have to keep raising it up and down before it finally latches securely at the desired level. I paid $64 for this but truly it's worth $19.99, maybe a few dollars more or less. I'll keep it because I have it assembled and don't want to go through the process of disassembling, re-packaging and returning it. However, it was easy to assemble and roll into place but I don't find feel it was worth the money I paid for it--NOT AT ALL. Hi,I bought this after I did research a lot of research, you'd think there easy to built,yes,and easy to use not all, I had to return one ajustable overbed table because it kept getting stuck,to where I could not ajust it period! I sent it back waited and researched for months for a simple easy Medical Adjustable Overbedtable and this one pretty much is simple to built and use, but like all overbed tables you can't lean on them or put too much weight on them,  just what's our need at a time, like your meal, then clear it, then maybe your book, or coffee! Well this Medical Ajustable Overbed Table was a nice surprise for someone I care about,and he loves it, he uses it all day ,everyday! So Yes it works,he likes it , it's worth the price! Thanks!K.Red Do yourself a favor, don't buy this piece of junk. Flush Money down the toilet instead. That may be more satisfying than watching this table break piece by piece. I think we've had it 2 weeks now. 1 wheel has broken. 1 has fallen off. Thankfully they were on opposite corners so the table would be level. Nope, that's not true either. From day 1 you put a water bottle on it and it slowly slides off onto the ground. Not such fun times. Any corner they could skimp on they probably did. Don't buy. Take it out of your cart now. You'll thank me later, when you purchase a better one. ", "I used this table for homework and as a over the bed desk. I only put 5lbs worth of stuff on at a time and yet overtime it still beagan to lean and break. I took it apart to examin it and attempt to fix it myself and it turns out that the issue is where the base meets the extendable arm, so I tried tightening the bolts and I thought it worked only for two days later the same issue would occur. I am not sure if i recieved a faulty table, but I am really sad that it is not working correctly because it helped me solve a lot of space issues in my room. I was hit by a car while riding my scooter in KeyWest FL by a tourist who ran a stop sign , I\u2019m so happy I ordered this table from Amazon , it\u2019s really helped me in so many ways , it\u2019s very easy to roll also you can lock the wheel if you want too , I haven\u2019t had to use that feature . I use it for eating , putting on my make up , and playing on my iPad . After I\u2019m healed and able to walk again I\u2019m still going to continue to use this table . I love it . It\u2019s very sturdy , but don\u2019t sit on it , it\u2019s not for that . \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d My mother is recovering from surgery and a lingering illness and takes her meals at her lift chair (kitchen chairs do not have arms to aid in seating/standing).  This table has worked well to hold her meals, as well as serving as a \"end table\" so she can easily store and reach her phone and various remotes (TV, gas logs, ceiling fan/light).  The small lip along the edges helps hold items while the table is being moved, as well as prevents small spills from ending up in her lap or on the floor.  Would recommend. This item of furniture has been wonderful on all counts.  Although it seemed a little lightweight at first, there have been no problems, and it has proven to be quite rugged.  I have a large 32\" flatscreen TV on it and have positioned the table  over the bed to allow viewing while lying in bed.  I make no apologies for my laziness :-) Bought this for my mother in law and could not be happier with the purchase. After her last stay at the hospital we decided she needed to have a table like this so she can move it back and forth as she gets in and out of her chair. The height it easy to adjust and it is very sturdy. It is so convenient for her to keep her phone, remote control, Bible study and Bible, or anything else she is using at the time in one area and in close proximity to her chair. She is able to pull it right up to her, then push it to the side to get up. I would highly recommend this table. I should have read the description a little more carefully. The only thing I don't like about this table is if my husband even bumps it with his knee from the underside it raises quickly and nearly bops him in the chin. They said it will raise with the slightest touch, and they are not kidding. I will be getting him a different one and using this one for myself as a computer stand. This stand IS NOT good for anyone with any type of motor skill disability which makes them react slowly. I was very excited about this table but it was damaged when it arrived. The damaged part (both under and above the table) looked small enough at first, so we assembled it anyway. Later I realized it is actually dangerous because the damaged part sticks out and there are thin wood parts that can hurt your legs while using the table or hurt your hands while carrying it. The table is made quite well, heavy duty legs and and braces.  For most people this will be used bed side, and the feature to push up and the table raises is nice.  My husband is using it at his chair in the living room for his laptop computer and a small set of drawers.  The dogs often crawl under the table and climb in his lap.  When they do this, the table raises it's self.  This is annoying to him to constantly readjust the table. I bought 2 of these for my husband , who had a stroke \u2014one for bedside & one for him in the living room. He uses both  & loves them!! I am not very mechanical, but I put both of them together myself\u2014no help!! Next, I purchased one for my 90 year-old father. And now, my brother wants one!! This little table is so convenient, adjustable, & useful!! Product works well most of the time. For some random reason, the tray will raise and lower just by barely touching it (nowhere near the lever). A few times I\u2019ve had my laptop on it and can\u2019t keep it at the appropriate height. ", "Product isn\u2019t as sturdy as I would like the wheels fall off if you lift it . It leans after put together . The handle to elevate works fine , but it is difficult to put up and down without two hands if you have had a stroke . I use this to stand in front of my three computer screens to work . I place the keyboard and mouse on it and work part of the day and move and replace chair when needed it is a inexpensive solution to stand and work . Three screens would not fit on a standing desk Really, really wanted to love this table because it is exactly what I have been looking for but sadly I don't. The base of the table is very solid and the table top is spacious, but the problem is in the frame design. When the bar that supports the table top is inserted into the table base there is so much play between those two connections that the table top moves forward and backwards about 3 to 4 inches each way. This loose connection also causes the table top to sag on the unsupported side and makes it difficult to maneuver. I have tried to find a way to make this connection more secure but everything that would work removes the \"adjustable\" feature.  According to the mfg and a few responses I received after posting a question leaves me to believe it is a hit or miss issue. I was going to return and order another one just to see if I could get one that didn't have this problem but sadly missed my return date. Again, it's a nice table but if you order it I hope you are one of the lucky ones that doesn't have this problem. This product is something I've used every day since its purchase in 2017. I bought the table to put my laptop on so I can sit in bed at night, watch TV and play on my computer.  It is too narrow for that.  The first time I pushed the table away, my laptop fell off and the frame cracked.  I have put a large board over the table so I have more room.  This also fixes the problem of the edge (that is supposed to stop things from sliding off the table!), which was uncomfortable on my arm when typing..  Problem solved.  The table top stays at the level you set it at and adjusts easily, the casters roll easily - even over carpet.  I've zip-tied an outlet bar to it so electricity is close at hand.  It works great for me. This Vaunn table is a welcome surprise.  We needed an overbed table quickly and relied on other reviews and an exhaustive search before this purchase, deciding that we would find another after getting through our immediate need if this one proved unsatisfactory for the long term.  This product is excellent, start to finish.  The enclosed assembly instructions were simple and the table is exactly what it should be - sturdy, easy to maneuver (even on carpet) and height adjustable with ease.  Highly recommended. Easily assembled but doesn't move up and down smoothly.  When I push it down, it's hard and then just gives way to my pressure.  Works for what I need it to do.  I wonder if I could spray it with WD-40 to make it smoother. I am 65, not strong, and I put it together by myself, very easy.  Although it doesn't work very well the way I wanted it to, it still works and I am managing with it.  I have an adjustable bed and with the motor under the bed towards the foot of the bed, I have a very difficult time getting it to slide under my bed and still give me enough room between my body and the table when the head of the bed is completely raised up in the sitting position. I got this for my gaming laptop so I\u2019m able to play anywhere in the house without having to have the laptop on my lap. Mine arrived intact and it was really easy to put together. The instructions were a little weird and I wish there was more pics but I figured it out. I had to use a pair of pliers to tighten the bolts. My issue with it is that it\u2019s really wobbly and i\u2019m not sure if I did something wrong or what. I\u2019m still going to keep it because I don\u2019t think it will bother me that much but if you need something sturdy I\u2019d say get a different table. Was looking for a small Height adjustable table for my Laptop, since I am trying to set up a work from home station without breaking the bank so to speak.  I got this Over bed table with Pneumatic height adjustment.  When I am working I set it low and if I am doing a Zoom meeting I set it high.  It is not the most sturdy, but it is sturdy enough.  It will shake if you shake it, but typing away on your laptop, it does not shake. My  second table from this manufacturer, Vaunn Medical. The first one I bought was several years ago and it was really hard to assemble. This improved table is excellent quality, they added a tiny lip around the edge that is smooth to the touch AND it\u2019s a breeze to assemble. I\u2019m 70.  All I needed was a Phillips screwdriver and a 6\u201d wrench.  The directions are easy. No missing steps. Excluding the removal from the well packed shipping box, it probably took me all of 15. Customer service is excellent.  (They offered to send a tiny screw bc I thought I had lost it.).  Tray rolls smoothly over carpeting. Does not wobble.  These are all true comments. ", "Instructions for assembly were clear and easy to follow. The casters roll quite nicely on carpet and rug. The only thing I am disappointed with is it is very difficult to raise and lower. It requires much more than \u201ca light upward touch\u201d that the description says. I bought this so I can easily use my laptop in bed or on the couch after an injury that resulted in a bulging disc with radiculopathy down my left arm, so obviously using that arm is quite difficult and painful. I guess I will have my husband raise and lower it for me until I can buy a different one. Before the adjustment lever broke, my husband and I were pretty satisfied with this table. It was fairly sturdy, easy to move around, and it was easy to change the height; I should clarify that my husband was the one moving it around, etc., and I was the one using it in my hospital bed. Anyway, something inside the lever assembly broke after five months, and we don't know what it was because there's a box around the assembly, and my husband can't see inside it. We were SO frustrated! We've never gotten around to ordering a different one, and have to be content with this \"bedside\" table. Also, this table didn't reach far enough across the bed for our purposes, but that was our fault for not measuring correctly. I ordered this on a whim for my apartment, mostly because a) it was inexpensive, and b) I liked the idea of using it to hold my laptop while working in bed. Unboxing it was a little annoying (hint: lay it flat, rather than following the This End Up instruction on the box), but putting it together was trivial, and it is remarkably solid. It's worth noting that the height adjustment isn't infinitely variable; it's incremented - You can only raise or lower it by 'notches' that are every inch or so. Functional, but just barely. Main bolt holes were spaced inaccurately and required elongation with a drill to be able to get both bolts to thread. Adjustment mechanism sticks, feels flimsy, and springs up about 1/2\" from its set position when you wiggle the table a little. Table is very flimsy and leans with any weight applied (far below rated load), especially at full extension. Would not buy again, and definitely not worth the price. This is the perfect (and cost effective) solution to the how to have a second monitor that's almost as portable as your laptop.  Oh and it took me all of ten minutes to unbox it and put it together.  I was prepared for the raise/lower mechanism to be a problem based on another review. While it's not quite as smooth as it shows in the video, it's really not that hard and I haven't eve tried a little WD-40.  All in all, my favorite purchase this year from Amazon. This table is great for a mobile bedside/laptop table. I use it for morning coffee, also. It was super easy to assemble; all the parts were included and completely intact. Casters roll perfectly. It\u2019s obviously not meant to hold super heavy things. It\u2019s perfect for light/medium weight objects. Meals would also be fine. They tell you to keep the tiny screw that locks the telescoping arm into place for transport but I lost mine already. I should have immediately taped it to the bottom of the table but didn\u2019t. The lowest setting is perfect for my use. Yours may vary. This makes having the kind of chronic issues that demand a LOT of bed-rest days very tolerable, and vastly improves my mood. It was pretty easy to put together..just follow the instructions.  I would have given it 5 stars except the small tray is never tightly attached..its always a little loose so if you were to put weight on it on one side only, I think the tray would collapse on that side and the item would fall off-and if that item is a glass of liquid, that wouldn't be pleasant!.. the big tray is sturdy and can hold a fair amount of weight with no issue of collapsing. I bought this because I was having a hysterectomy and knew I would be having to rest a lot for a few weeks. I liked the idea of having it handy and easy to move. I have such a hard time moving it towards me because the top is very wobbly. for the length of the table top it should have come with a longer wider attachment plate. Unfortunately, I cannot do anything about it now since I cannot lift or strain. Also, it is not a deal breaker but there is not a lip around the edge to keep things from falling off. I have accidentally knocked off my tissue box and was unable to bend down to pick it up. I found this table easy to assemble however I was very unhappy with the amount of side to side movement in the top.  When you hold down the base but try to move the top side to side in a horizontal fashion, there is at least 3\" of movement if you were to measure at the end opposite the vertical telescoping support.  I don't think this is a defect but intend to contact the manufacturer or seller and see what can be done.  I think this is a result of a poor design of the glide mechanism in the vertical support.  Very disappointing.  The ones used in the hospital have maybe 0.5\" of similar movement. ", "If you're expecting the same quality as a hospital, rehab center, or nursing home, this is not it. Looking up the company from the one at the nursing home, it was $250 to buy it, so I guess you get what you pay for. The tray is wiggly. It expands upwards smooth, but going down is jumpy. I would not leave an open cup on this tray. It doesn't roll well on carpet, the wheels are cheap. I guess I was expecting more with the glowing reviews. Really easy to assemble and it was great at first. Now, almost 6 months later, it no longer goes up and down. I did manage to get it into the second to lowest position, which is an okay height, but I'd like it one level lower. I took it apart (all but 2 screws that would not come out....2 of the do not remove screws) to see if I could figure out what the problem is, but couldn't find any issues. I did find it rather difficult to adjust the height on even before this issue, so maybe there was an issue with the mechanism from the beginning and I just didn't realize it. this is awesome.  we use it as a kind of desk for using the computer from our beds.  it's very easy to push this table away to get up or to go to sleep.  It is sturdy, well built and practical.  It was very quick and easy to assemble it. It\u2019s not what I anticipated, it wobbled a lot and wasn\u2019t very sturdy. It doesn\u2019t have 360 wheels so u can only move the table in ONE direction. I have a shoulder tear so I couldn\u2019t move it by myself which is why I bought it\ud83d\ude12 This table is sturdy, easy to roll, and the perfect size to go across a twin XL bed (my half of a king-size). Great for folks who are on bed rest, as well as those who simply want to work in bed. Large enough to spread out papers or to use a laptop. Easily holds tray of food plus meds, etc. Customer service is amazing. I was sent a defective unit and based on my review, they contacted me and sent a replacement a) free of charge, and b) within a matter of days.The second table performs beautifully. I've never had a company work so hard to make things right. Highly recommend the product and the company. I purchased this product for my husband who is disabled and we used it for about 2 months when we started to see that the handle lever to make the table go up and down started to get harder and harder to adjust that my wrist started to hurt.  We did not put anything heavy on it, we used it mostly for his beverages.  After only 4 months of use, I could not adjust it anymore.  Seemed like a good product and price seemed good and I read peoples reviews.  We do like the table for our purpose, it just was a shame that the lever started to malfunction. Before becoming bed-bound by terminal cancer, my mother purchased an adjustable bed for use The product shipped quickly and arrived on time. Assembly instructions were clear. However, the holes for attaching the mast to the table are not cut well enough and it takes a lot of force to screw them together. On fact, it was so poorly cut that some of the screws went in at a bit of an angle. I'm a retired RN and wanted a quality over bed table like the ones we use in the hospital - for home.  This table is fantastic - easy to put together, moves easily, good size and sturdy.  We can use  for lots of functions - crochet in bed while watching TV, eat, use a laptop, etc.  In fact, I'm getting a second one.  If you're on the fence - try this. I normally don't write very many reviews and not this soon after receiving the product but I just had to counter some of the other reviews about how hard this was to put together...actually it couldn't have been easier and I'm a small 64 year old woman and had it together in no more then 5 minutes  Unlike a lot of directions these were very concise and a cinch to follow.  I know this because I have another hospital table that I bought from Amazon that was extremely hard to put together.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is because the color is very deceiving... it shows more of a lighter color in the picture but it's actually a reddish brown.  I know it says walnut but depending on the stain that's used it could have been a lighter walnut other then that it works as stated. ", "Easy assembly. Less than 10 minutes including unpacking. Sturdy. Easy to move about on hardwood or short pile carpet. Height adjustment is simple. Does what I would expect with no issues. I bought this product to replace one that wore out. I don't like the vinyl edging on the top. It catches everything. Also the selected position doesn't lock and often drops down to the next lower position. The manufacturer reached out to me and sent a replacement. I am very happy with the new table. This manufacturer really stands behind their product. I love the product, it is high quality made. It is also quite easy to assemble. The reason I did not give 5 star because the instructions are badly written. The part numbers do not match each other. For example, the Parts List says #11 is the 3/8\u201d #18 UNF Bolt, but the label on the package is for the \u201cBolt Plate\u201d. Seems to me all the numbering is off by 1 for the Parts List. See image attached for more detail. I would give this a five star but the table came without instruction. My husband was able to put it together, however the table wouldn't rise. He discovered a set screw that holds the table in a locked position, once he removed the screw the table worked fine. The screw is black and is positioned inside of the post inline with the \"do not remove screws\". This product arrived on time.  It was easy to assemble - if you are fairly handy it will only take one person.  The only glitch I had was that the raise/lower adjust seemed to be caught on a manufacturer screw (labeled \"Do not remove\") somewhere on the leg and needed a lot of torque to raise initially.  Once that obstacle was overcome, no problems. I bought two of these for my hubby and me. We use them just like tv trays. They are easy to adjust up and down. Materials were well made and very sturdy. We are currently quarantined from the virus. These will come in handy in the event one or both of us become ill. On a lighter note, when our grandchildren are able to visit again the tables will adjust to accommodate their varied sizes. I love that the tables have a decent width to them. Good deal for the price. Sturdy, compact; adjustable! I spend a lot of time in bed due to illness and this has significantly improved my life when trying to work from home. Keeps me from having to look down and strain my neck, elevating my laptop to a comfortable position. Plenty of space to also hold my water bottle, etc. love the wheels on it And adjustability is I can use in multiple situations. I got this because I am about to have yet another anlle surgery and know I will be in bed a lot and am trying to make my life easier. This is a decent bed table but I don't find it goes up and down as easy as I would like for when I am laid up. And it seems a bit unsteady when you move it. I would hesitate to put a full drink on it then push it away from me. The table top is much smaller than my older one. It's hard to get the table part pushed back down once it is up.  You can't set anything that is a little heavy at the non supported end because it will make the table top sag down causing the table top to be very un-level. I had to put my laptop at the end that has the support. But all in all, it works for what I need it for. Ultimately had to return because table was wobbly. No matter how we tightened the screws it was still wobbly. It seemed like a safety hazard for this reason. ", "This is a classic sliding table that you would see in a hospital or rehab center.  I purchased this for my mother who was recovering from surgery and needed a sliding table to make life easier at home.  It took about 5 min total to put together and rolls around the house perfect.  I was surprised at the price and value for the cost, this table is solid and does everything it advertises. This is a great product.  Quality materials, well designed, easy to assemble.  When I assembled it, all the parts were there and holes lined up and it went together in 15 minutes easy.  No sweat. This product is almost perfect for us.  It is high quality and very sturdy.  Perfection would be a 4\" lower bottom position for my wife BUT it is still usable and good for her.  One VERY MINOR disappointment was \"no bonus wrench and gloves\".  Of course that is not a big deal but they were advertised and the lower desired position is not a real problem.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I found this table to be very useful for my father, who has mobility problems now and needs to eat most of his meals in bed. It was very easy to assemble and is very easy to move around. As some other reviewers have noted, the table isn't necessarily the sturdiest and it does wobble a bit, but as long as you don't put too much weight on it, you shouldn't have any problems. Overall a very nice table to use for the bedroom. The table is an excellent value for the price point.  Love Love Love it and it suits our purposes.  (A loved one in memory care, eating in this room due to avoid contact with others due to covid).  Very sturdy.  Not too hard to assemble, but I needed a helper and missed one step. I am not used to putting things together,  and it went better than I expected.  Someone who is more experienced might not have a problem at all. Bought this for my Mom who has recently moved into a nursing room.  Her rehab/physical therapy place had a similar tray table, so when she moved to the new place, she really missed it.  Having limited arm mobility from a stroke, this table really helps her out, especially for meals.  I was so grateful to be able to find one on Amazon.  My husband assembled it without any complaints.  Seems sturdy and works well.  I like that the wheels have the option to lock, and the height is adjustable. I ordered this for my uncle who recently had hip surgery.  Due to all of his medical equipment,  he needed a table that rolled. He loves this product.  The only complaint I have heard is that he would like it better if it had a lip around it so his stuff wouldn't fall off when he goes to grab something.  Other than that, he is 100% thrilled with this table! This table is perfect for my elderly father in law who doesn\u2019t move around too well. It gives him a good size flat surface to hold his laptop, magazines, or food and drink when he sits in his chair. Being on wheels allows him to pull it in front of him push it to the side easily. The height is easily adjustable too. My teenage son put it together for him. This is s great product to use to work from home or make life easier after surgery.  Very well made. Would have rated higher if it could have been set up for left handed as well as right.  One more hole is all it would have taken in manufacturing.  I have to use it backwards which gives less room.  Otherwise a great product. Doesnt maneuver good, broke already, and it hasn't even been a year. The locks dont work. The table still moves around. Not good for heavy items. ", "The table top is not stable. The assembly was straight forward. One of the base assembly bolts was striped, not a concern for me, screwed it in I will not be removing it. Also the table top is particle board so adding some type of glue is the six holes for mounting the top to the rising mechanism can be helpful . The Eva Medical Adjustable Overbed Table with wheels is FANTASTIC. It comes in the Two lovely colors of Brown & Walnut Brown. ;)  The spring loaded locking handle WORKS. You can raise or lower the table to fit over your bed, in front of the sofa, or in your home office. It rolls very well and stays put when you lock the wheels.  I purchased this table on 2016 01-23 and liked it so much that I purchased another one on 2016-03-01. The second table also has the swivel top. They are both rated up to 40lb weight limit. NOTE - Weight limit doesn't seem that important until the weight of whats on the table (my laptop) slowly bends then snaps the metal frame. THAT TABLE WAS NOT FROM THIS COMPANY!! Bought this for my dad whoe is bedridden. It worked well the first few months but would no longer adjust. A screw had fallen out so my husband disassembled it and put it back together, 3 months later it is again not adjusting. Do not feel this is worth the price, better off spending a little more to get a quality table. This table was a great deal for the money, easy to assemble and easy to adjust the height.  Perfect for my husband's recovery from hip surgery. disappointed.  bought from amazon on july 8 2020.  delivered july 10 2020.  when went to order site to review , I bought this for my girlfriend's she has vision problems and this table came with a crack on one of the corners this should not be hollow This table makes a difference if you are caring for mostly bedridden elderly parent. I also bought an attachable cup holder that was recommended, but due to lip on table the cup holder was unstable - so sent it back. Highly suggest not recommending an accessory product that does not actually work. However, the table itself is great; very sturdy and rolls well. It was well packaged and extremely easy to assemble. Its not going to last long, out of the box, its super flimsy. Mine leans a bit, not a straight surface. So basically, I am only keeping it because its too hard to disassemble and mail back to be honest. Might just be needed for a family member\u2019s recovery post-surgery, and for a short time. Purchased this over the bed table for my husband to have beside his hospital bed at home.  First of all it was NOT that easy to assemble as the advertisement would have you believe.  If I have to go to the toolbox in the garage to get tools to put something together then that indicates too much effort is required.  The casters were supposed to just \"pop\" into place but that took more effort than the other steps.  The table is still not level and the table is difficult to move around and the casters are not even locked; plus the tabletop appears to be unlevel and sitting askew....due to the lopsidedness of the casters.  This is not a \"hospital grade quality\" product. We needed a table that would move easily for a home hospital bed. Having one similar to the hospital style is nice as it can either go by the side or right over the patient. The casters roll nicely over the shag carpet too. The mechanism makes it nice for quick height adjustments which is crucial when dealing with a terminally ill person. Assembly was a breeze which made me even happier. ", "Careful of very sharp edges. Overall I like this table. I use it as a laptop table over my bed. I use it to be productive and get computer work done at times my body just wants to be lazy, instead of ending up doing nothing at all. It helps when I need to react quickly in the morning to respond to something without procrastinating and not getting up, bc the computer is in the other room. It\u2019s very useful but the lifting mechanism is not working well.  Sometimes, it lifts, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a pain to exchange or return it. I didn't expect hospital quality but this table is very wobbly.  We double checked our assembly to make sure we didn't do anything wrong but it all looks good.  Table looks good, functions up and down well but it is very shaky when used and already leaning down on one side.  I am kicking myself for not spending a bit more and getting a better overbed table.  Hoping hubby is healthier soon and doesn't need this for long. Fits well in the narrow space available next to the hospital bed we have in my husband study. Well built and stable. Easy to roll and rise and lower. I like it. It was relatively easy to put together even with an arm that was recently operated on. Instructions were good. Nice, sturdy table. Very happy. Makes my life a lot more comfortable. Buy it. This was a great purchase. Bought this for my mom who now has an apartment in Assisted Living. This is very helpful for when she has snacks in her room or does puzzles etc. It is very sturdy and easy to operate. It would have been helpful to come with an instruction sheet. It was easy to put together, however, a little confusing at the end when the tabke would not operate. Finally figured the screw removal. Mom loves the table. Moves smoothly. Height adjusts easily. Doesn't fit under lower furniture (we couldn't use it with the bed but we could use it with the couch).  The lowest height isn't comfortable for use while sitting at a couch though it would probably work well if you were using an office-type chair. I bought this for use with my laptop, and found that I couldn't see the keyboard, so I wound up getting a model with a tilting surface instead. I looked at a lot of reviews. I'm glad I settled on this one. The bar across the bottom is offset. And it has a very nice clasp. It goes up and down smoothly. The tray has a slight ridge which makes it nice for any potential spills or things trying to slide off in while moving it. I received my Table on time.  I needed a table because my husband had major heart surgery and will need bandage changes for the rest of his life, daily.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  It not to huge, but good size,  for me it's just right.  It was easy to put together and I love how easy it goes up and down. I am tall and I can adjust the height exactly where I want it.  I would recommend this table Easily maneuvers over carpet and under bed.  Tremendous asset for me during recent surgery recovery.  Highly recommend. ", "My husband was discharged from the hospital with limited mobility. This table swings right over the top of his lift chair. He keeps it to the side most of the time to hold his phone, tablet, something to drink but he can swing it to the front himself to eat or work on the tablet. Just what I wanted. I wanted something to go next to my adjustable computer desk. This works great and is height adjustable for sitting and standing. I usually have 20 pounds of text and/or reference books on it and never had any issues. I only wish it had a little bit of tilt adjustment. I wanted a sturdy bed table to use as a place to keep a couple books,  journal, ledger,  computer tablet etc, and occasional snacks, cup of soup, etc.  I don't think I'd dare put a drink on it for fear of it tipping over, as the slightest moves jar the table.  Seriously thought about returning it but don't want to go through the hassle.  I'll just make sure to not put certain food or drinks on it.  For the price, it's okay, and it shipped promptly. My husband just got a hospital bed. This bedside table works great. The up & down mechanism works like a jewel, the table can easily be pushed with the rolling wheels from room to room & adjusts easily to serve as a tray over his wheelchair. I consider it an excellent purchase & value and is well made. The bedside table was easy to assemble, took maybe 5 minutes. Love the adjustable height. Bought it for my elderly parent, they use it for a variety of reasons: to eat meals, convenient access to a laptop, and easy access to phone and tv remote. This is a great solution. It is a little challenging to maneuver when on carpet though. Not very easy to move in and out from under the bed, but moves great if you have a tile floor. The product was delivered as advertised this is the second one that I bought not knowing I would need another the first was exactly the same perfect. The seller is awesome delivered it 2 days prior to the estimated delivery date on time none undamaged perfect thanks guys. The table is used for home care for my wife. Works great. My wife uses one of these as a bedside table and seems to hold up well.  Although a little flimsy it is constructed well enough to hold quite of bit stuff on it.  I believe the weight limit is between 40-50lbs.  It also helps that two of the wheels have a lock on them to keep the table from moving around yet easy to push away if needed.  Easy to assemble. Needed this for my son after knee surgery.  It was perfect.  Easy to assemble quickly, and sturdy.  He used it for 2+ months with no issues.  Now he is thinking he will use it when he works from home so he won't have to get off the couch.  We may have created a monster here. My over the bed table is superb. Purchased for personal use at home. From the heart of an almost 86 year old, wheelchair bonded great grandmother, I had more trouble getting the parts out of the very sturdy carton, than putting it together. Instructions precise, easy to follow but assembly is obvious to see. Has big 4 inch rollers and moves easily on hard flooring. HOWEVER, does not roll easily on carpeting. Just move more carefully. Table surface  is fantastic. Lowest height setting allows me the space required to be comfortable when pulled over the body. We got this for my wife who is confined to a hospital bed.  It was easy to assemble & the height adjusts easily.  Due to its small wheels, it doesn't roll easily on a carpeted floor.  The top has a slight edge around it to keep small objects from rolling off, but feels a little wobbly at times.  It can tip fairly easily if you try to move it when extended to full height.  Because the arm holding the table top is offset, it works better when placed on the right side of the bed, than the left.  Still a good value, for a very reasonable price. ", "I previously bought one of these to use for home dialysis. I bought a second one which was defective in that bolt holes holding the wheel assembly didn't line up with the upright stem. I took pictures which the manufacturer requested, but they then asked to see a picture showing how the holes don't line up. Unfortunately it takes two people to both hold the pieces in place and take the picture. As an elderly disabled person living alone I couldn't do this. This company actually sent a picture showing exactly the defect I'm telling them about, so they're bviously aware of the defect,but still no cooperation. Don't waste your money on this one! The assembly is easy and the table is very stable and heavy duty.  Use to move about even on carpet.  The wheels lock so one does need to worry about it moving while in use.  The height can be adjusted easily. Good bed desk however it is hard to maneuver on carpet and the table doesn't reach far enough over the bed I bought this for my mom who is wheelchair bound and uses a medical bed. I picked this one specifically because of the high ratings. It worked great for about a month, just long enough that it went over the return time. It quit going up and down and appears that something inside malfunctunctioned. Got this for my bedridden mother and she LOVES it! We have to tilt it for her but other than that it's super convenient. She puts her tablet on it to read and she still has a convenient place for her drink. It was (to me) pretty easy to put together and raises and lowers easily. I would definitely recommend this one as it holds up to anything she puts on it, it barely even moves, or tilts, when her 18lb cat climbs up on it. I purchased this as a bedside table but it just isn't sturdy enough to hold food or drinks which is pretty much it's entire purpose. Also, read the instructions well. There is a screw that needs to be removed for it to work and I spend days on it. I purchased this over bed bedside table for my Uncle who is bedridden.  He has been using a TV tray for over a year with a lot of inconvenience.  I bought this unit sight unseen and only by the description online.  My Uncle received it quickly and has told me it is wonderful!  Every time I call and check on him he shares how much it has made his life easier.  I would recommend this bedside table for durability and easy to assemble. Just perfect - does the job meant to do ! Just what I wanted. I sit on the couch to work on my computer but needed something to rest my computer on because it is heavy. While it doesn't slide underneath I put it short end towards me. Then I push it away when I need to get up. No twisting. Just ok.  The directions were numbered wrong but common sense got me through the build... I don't like the lever handle it sits loose but overall it works. ", "I love this table! If you're looking for a sturdy, easily adjustable table, then look no further! This is not as bulky as your hospital overbed table but still functional and easy to move around. Assembling was a lot easier than I thought. The only part I messed up on is removing the transport screw (because I didn't read the instructions). If you don't remove that screw you won't be able to adjust the table up and down. This is a great at home bed table. Not just for medical use. It is convenient table for anyone wanting convenience of having thing at your bed but not on it. I do suggest paying particular attention to the size. This is not a full size bed table. This is a very well made table. My husband put it together in 10 minutes,  and I've already got it set up although my surgery isn't scheduled for 4 more days.  Its out of the way when i want it to be, and I've sat in bed with my laptop for 2 hours and felt very comfortable. I will have what i need at arms reach while I'm recovering. Well worth the money. La mesa aunque es peque\u00f1a, cumple con su objetivo. F\u00e1cil de armar, muy buen ajuste de altura tanto para usarla como auxiliar (su prop\u00f3sito principal) en la cama, como en un sill\u00f3n o silla. En cuanto a la calidad, lo justo por su precio y considero que es buena. Gracias. None Table is just perfect for my mom.... its sturdy n easy to move. I'm so happy it wasn't cheap and it was very easy to assemble. I highly recommend this table for the elderly, disabled or anyone who would like a table to go over the bed. My mom is disabled and its perfect 4 her. The only drawback for me is using it on carpet.  Larger wheels might be better, but might not fit under bed.  Great utility...saves me lots of space and eliminated bed tray sitting around and long enough for items needed within reach for my husband.  We like it. This is the perfect portable desk to use with  any type of chair. We are using it with a recliner, and it slides conveniently under the chair. Because it\u2019s adjustable, it\u2019s the perfect height. Two wheels fall right off the second you move it.  There is nothing securing the wheels in place. Used the product 3 times when the lever stopped working and the table height could no longer be adjusted. Contacted seller who agreed to have product returned. Sadly, I no longer had a box the right size to ship it back, and the money lost was not worth the hassle of searching for a way to ship it. Cheaply made lever/spring mechanism, but I'm stuck with it now Works as described. My mom had just been released home after a months stay in the hospital (after cervical spine surgery). We needed a table that could be adjusted to keep her neck from bending. The height adjustable table did the job. ", "The tray is a bit more wobbly than I expected it to be, but this works just fine for what I needed to do. Table was sturdy and well built. Easy to raise and lower and rolls well on my carpet. I used it as desk for my computer when I had to work from home after surgery so I could work from my couch as I was not able to spend many hours on the task chair. Also works great as a table for eating or working while laying in bed. The only thing is be sure you have some height under your couch if you want to use it while working on your couch because one of my couches had feet that were too short and the wheels would not slide under it to bring the table closer to you when sitting. This table is too high for our needs.  We have an Invacare standard semi electric hospital bed and it's too high for it. I would think this type of table would have this type of bed in mind when designing the tray height.  And I don't find the maximum height even a height anyone would use.  It goes way too high that even when standing up you couldn't use it.  And the tray easily springs up at any movement of the tray, which is really inconvenient and takes a lot of force to put back down. This is the perfect table for a hospital bed, which my husband is now using. My husband is confined to a wheelchair so this was handy for him to use for eating his meals.  However, the screws easily came out and made the height adjustment dysfunctional. I didn't notice screws had fallen out and could not get them back in. I liked everything about this table. It works well with my husband\u2019s hospital bed. I put it together in minutes. It telescopes up and down and stays in every position I have put it in. Easy to operate and easy to disinfect. top sways/moves around a lot You have to balance yourself properly over the table in order to lower it smoothly, but other than that it serves its purpose well. Meant to be a coffee table in front of the TV, the remote control would not \"zap\" over it.  Now it is a perfectly handy plant stand that can be rolled from the window without the sun to the window with the sun. This is exactly what I needed since a traditional night stand won't work with a side car crib. A bit more force to put it down than expected, but it does what it should and allows me to keep things nearby! Don't really like that I need to keep up with the Transport Screw. Seems like there should be some onboard method of locking it down. ", "Just what we needed because of Jackie\u2019s broken hip. Will be able to use it several other ways in the future too. Built strong enough to last! I needed additional space around my wife's sickbed, so I ordered this unit. It was easy to assemble. It will hold a tray of food, meds, and bedside items. I wouldn't place anything heavy on it. It maneuvers well on tile or hardwood floors, but not on carpeting that I have. Styling is basic. It is not like the typical hospital bedside tables which are heavy duty. Exactly what I expected for the money I've paid Had surgery and needed a table by my bed for easy reach.  This one is easy enough to assemble but not sturdy and does not move well.  I have a high bed is the only redeeming quality was the height was perfect, thus the reason for a second star Table is well made and functional, slightly less sturdy than a typical hospital unit but quite functional for home use and at an attractive price. Rolls well on hard surfaces and even wall to wall carpeting, be carful on rugs. One downside I ordered the chrome unit and received the powder coated one, didn't bother me enough to return it but lost a star in the rating. I liked that it was super easy to put together.  After I assembled it, I read the directions about how to assemble it, and I did it perfectly, except, I learned that I had to remove the little black screw to allow the table top to go up and down, and replace it with another, unrestricted screw, provided. Got this for my wife who was bedridden after surgery. She was skeptical at first. Now she loves it and uses it as a computer/craft table even when not in bed. Went together quickly with no problems. Just like the ones at the hospital. I bought this to use as my husband's table for work at hime.. when he goes back to work I will use it for probably a t.v dinner table. It is sturdy. Good quality. I received this table in January 2018 and now four months later it will no longer raise or lower. It is stuck at one height. This table is a necessity as it is/was used by my son who is paralyzed and used it daily at various heights. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Only issue I had was it was supposed to be EVA but I received an Invacare instead.  I don't like that they advertise one brand but send you another...  I had the option to order Invacare but chose this EVA one based on reviews.  I was able to put together on my own, just really make sure you tighten all the screws. No issues so far. not exactly what I was expecting, hence the four stars, but is a good table for someone bed ridden. I like it. Very easy to assemble. Had an extra screw that I am not sure it belonged in the package but I spent some time to see where it could go (or where it could have fell off from). ", "The table arrived in good time.  It's made well and it's sturdy.  It didn't take much work to put it together although I had to ask my husband to tighten the screws.  I could only get them halfway down.  I've used the table and found the width to be just right for putting my lunch or dinner tray and beverage.  Easy to clean.  I would recommend it. I originally purchased to use while propped up in bed to use my laptop,  but found its great to wheel wherever I want for certain projects that I need a flat surface for. I bought this for my laptop, which was painful to rest on my legs in bed,  It was a cinch to assemble, rolls well on carpet, adjusts easily, and is perfect in my bedroom.  My granddaughters are envious and want one, too! These tables are quite versatile. I\u2019m in a wheelchair. Two tables serve as a desk and the other for everything else. The locking casters work well. Moreover, assembly is a breeze. 10-minutes. Use this as a desk for homework because my room is to small for a real desk. I can easily use it over my bed too for snacks hehe. Sometimes I wish it tilted so I could prob my book up while I\u2019m typing assignments. I have my 10lb laptop, 4lb laptop power brick and all sorts of junk on this thing and its never given up. If the top came in more modern looking options (all white maybe?)  i would be in love with it more. It does wobble a bit if you put too much weight and just in general but at this price its what you get and it does not hamper anything. Bought this for my grandma to use since she is bedbound. Very helpful for her to eat and even can be used to put laptop and movies while in bed. Also it\u2019s very sturdy but I wouldn\u2019t put full body weight on it continuously. It is made from some particle board material but it\u2019s still seems very durable. Would buy again. Great product. Super sturdy. My dad loves it. The materials are of good quality, however, the table top is not very stable. The table top support does not go all the way across, it is only on one end, and so the side without the under-support is a bit unstable. I am trying to figure out how I can improve that. Table top offset by design and not level, tilted toward front side. Table top made of particale board and screws securing top pulled out after 2 months use. Would not recommend purchase to anyone. of course time to return has expired and I'll need to by a different replacement. Waste of time, effort and money. ", "WOW !!!! ease of assembly A+ 6 screws to Mount the top and 2 bolts for the base.  Extremely well built. I was looking at one from another company but it was mostly all wood and I wanted something sturdy. Just a simple hospital grade bed table. I got it for half the price and it's extremely sturdy. All A's We use this in our nursery next to the rocker. It works great when holding a sleeping baby who is sick or just needs to cuddle but when you want to work on the laptop, or set things next to the rocker on a table that moves as needed. When the rocker moves out of the nursery, the table will follow as a laptop table for the living room. The Overbed table was easy to assemble, and is very sturdy once assembled. I liked the fact that, other than some other table tops ... this one had an edging strip that gave a slight lip all around the table top. Some other tables of this same design had a \"flush\" edge around them. which I didn't like as much. I recommend this table over most of the others, as it has a 1/16 inch lip around the entire top edge.  Things won't roll off.  Was easy to build, all the parts were included, holes were pre drilled into the wood perfectly.  Arrived very quickly with standard free shipping too. Excellent product. Really nice, sturdy and very easy to assemble . I used my drill and and pair of pliers. Having  surgery and purchased for temporary  conveience but can see  using it beyond that time period to sit my computers and notebooks while relaxing  in bed or sitting  around in other spots around the house The table is VERY EASY to assemble.  Look closely for the 'little black screw' indicated on the instructions (which keeps the mechanism from raising and lowering during shipping)... it has to be removed to work properly once assembled.  Otherwise the table seems a bit more wobbly than I expected but it's okay for our purposes. Worked for awhile. Now the lever to raise and lower the table takes a great deal of pressure to operate. If you have arthritis forget it. Dont make the mistake I did. Don't buy this one. I bought this for my husband to use after surgery but I\u2019m the one who\u2019s ended up using it everyday. I really like how easy it is to adjust the height with a simple lift of a lever. Great size for electronics, eating, reading, etc. It only took my wife and I a few minutes to install it.  You will probably want to use a hand drill to attach the mast to the table top.  The table looks very nice and we have had no issues with it. This item is great at first, but know it will not stay up where I have set it, it always falls back down when you put the slightest bit of weight on it ", "This product is very good. Not as big as the ones in the hospital but just as efficient. Took about 10 min to assemble, It is very functional and sturdy enough for its weight. It is not as sturdy as those expensive heavy units you see in a hospital but I got my money's worth. This tables up and down mechanism sticks and is difficult.  I returned one and the replacement is just as bad. No stars for anything else,table can't be used so ease in assembly really does not matter. It took only 15 minutes to assemble and set in place. I'm very happy with my purchase. Exactly what I expected.  Not as sturdy as the ones used in hospitals, but the product description states it has a 25lb weight limit so I did not anticipate this being a hospital-grade table.  It was super easy to put together. The trim strip around the outside of the table top sits slightly higher than the table top by a fraction of an inch, not enough to bother you, but just enough to keep a cup from sliding off the top once when I moved the table too fast.  I use this for working from home.  I put this in front of a comfortable chair, put my laptop on it and work all day, then wheel it into a closet at night.  Also works great for use in bed if ever needed.  The wheels roll fine on medium height carpet and since it's not a heavy table it doesn't ruin the carpet. The table is fairly strong and easy to put together. Height adjustment cout improve but allin all is ok for the price. Bought this for my Dad who spends most of his time in bed.  I really love using this tray for anything he  wants to use it for while he is in bed.  Eating, doing crossword puzzles .. set up fast and works well.  Very sturdy. We are very satisfied with our purchase. The construction  is solid so the table does not wobble.  We have no problem with the lever and are able to raise and lower the table quite easily.  The casters make it easy for me to move the table into a suitable position by myself.  Because the base is offset I can  get my wheelchair close enough to the table so I can do anything I need.  We look forward to many years of service from this table. This was easy to assemble, the tabletop moves up and down with ease, the wheels make it extremely easy to maneuver. Good size tabletop and it has a sleek overall appearance. Only one thing they could improve on - tabletop wobbles slightly. If they extended the support bar underneath the tabletop out about a foot, that would probably take care of that wobble. I purchased two of these under-the-bed tables and both have this slight problem. But it wouldn't stop me from buying another. This table has been great for working on my laptop while on the couch recovering from foot surgery. I especially like the lip around the edge of the table that keeps things from rolling off. ", "The screws were different and one would not go in the hole.  We tried to get a tap for it, but couldn't get the right size... after several trips to the hardware store we finally forced the screw in and we have the table.  Table is good, just hard to assemble. I loved it so much, I sent one to my sister as well. It makes our lives so much easier, wish it had a little drawer underneath, but other than that, it is perfect!! Well built and balanced. Easy up & down lever. It goes from room to room for me, I eat my meals from it and at night it holds all of my remotes and water with medications as well. It is perfect!! Oh, did I say that already?\ud83e\udd17 Out of the box, took a couple minutes to put together at most.  Their is a video on the product page that easily shows how to assemble.  Had no trouble and it works great!  Definitely a great purchase. The product arrived on time, but doesn't last beyond 2 months. The rubber border comes off and the table tilts. The height adjustment also stops working within a few weeks. All in all, not worth the cost. It's far to hi to be used as a key board, mouse/ laptop table. Ev n with a seat cushion this is far to high. Table part wobbles back and forth too much and the leaver is far too stiff even harder to pull up and down Smallish studio apartment.  this table allows my mother to access her drink, reading material, tv remote and cellphone from bed, her wheel chair, and recliner.  No need for multiple tables. It works fine.  It's too tall with the wheels on it to go under the chair.  I fixed that by replacing the wheels with carpet sliders. These are great for disabled. They are the same quality as the hospital. Great by lazy boy chairs,  beds and even to use in food prep by people with trouble moving, or breathing issues. If you have parents, grandparents, they make great gifts! Fantastic product. I love to buy them for disabled friends. I bought this table because my mother was visiting and I wanted a table in her room that she could use for numerous things. Really like this table and easy to assemble. Have had this medical table for a little over a year and the adjustment lever is stuck.  Guess we'll have to flip it over and see what's what, see if we can fix it.  Do we need parts?  What a pain in the neck. ", "This is super easy to assemble. If I can do it, you can too - trust me. Watch the assembly video and you\u2019re good to go. My only concern is that it\u2019s a tad wobbly at the top but I think it will be fine for my uses. Assembled in approximately 20 minutes. Very useful, keep my water and my tissues and other relevant items on the table with my TV remote and newspaper. Can\u2019t live without it. I read every night and this tray is great. My husband like it so much I ordered him one also. It can be used to read in a recliner ora bed. Lifts up high easily. This table was quite a nice purchase for an elderly person who became bedridden during the final weeks of their life. It is solid, sturdy, and easy to adjust height. I found it to be the equal of tables used in hospitals and nursing homes. Highly recommend it if you need a table like this, bedside. This table was very easy to assemble.  Overall,  I\u2019m very pleased with this table.  It\u2019s a little wobbly but the wheels roll nicely.  I purchased this for use as a laptop cart it\u2019s the perfect size for my intended use! This is just what I needed for my husband with handicaps.  It is just like at the nursing home.  Table lifts and lowers effortlessly which is a big factor to me The instructions for assembly were extremely clear and easy to read (large print!) and to understand.  A screw driver and a crescent wrench were only items needed.  Once assembled, the table glides easily, wheels lock and unlock easily.  Tray surface is large and easy to keep clean.  Plenty of height adjustment.  VERY pleased, definitely recommend. Very sturdy and constructed well. Is a large surface & works well for my mother I care for. She sits in a glider rocker in the day and it fits nicely for her to eat off of then at night I roll it to her bedside and can sit her drinks and snacks on while watching tv. Absolutely recommend this product! I wish I would have bought this a long time ago! This table is exactly what I was hoping for.  Using it in an assisted living room. It is very sturdy, rolls nicely, looks good & fits over a wheelchair, a power lift recliner (when the legs are up), and perfectly next to the bed.  We were using a wood tv tray. This is tons better & much, much sturdier. I recently purchased a Temperpedic mattress with remote control base that allows you to sit up in bed(best investment EVER). However, sitting up in bed, I couldnt access my dresser, that I use as a night stand when the bed is in the flat position. With that said, I elected to purchase this,to serve my needs as a movable night stand. I was amazed how simple putting this together. One of the bolts gave me a hard time, but my stubborn Scorpio self...refuse to give up:) ", "Love this table.  So, So easy to put together.  10 minutes!  I looked at a lot of other tables for sale on amazon and read all the reviews.  Other tables seemed more confusing to put together and based on a review for this table I decided to order this one.  It is an awesome table, works great, very easy to put together! Strong enough to hold my laptop, 2nd monitor, and mouse.  Love that I can adjust it up or down (works well and most often no challenge at all).  This enables me to work standing (I am 5'2\").  I also have worked at this table with a small floor stepper for exercise and propped up my laptop on an empty shoebox.  Wheels work well too and it is easy to move around.  I love that I can work sitting or standing with so much more easy and comfort! The little side table does not stay flat it does move a little even when tightened down.  the lever that lifts and lowers the table is glitchy. I ordered this for my dad, i work in a hospital and thought this is the best table for him in living room and bedroom. I sent my engineer brother to put it together, but he cant get it to go up and down. I am very disappointed. My wife uses it for a bedside computer table.  The last table we had was flimsy and didn't last long. This one is sturdy and is easy to assemble. The only thing it doesn't do is tilt toward her but the strength of the table and the ease of use it worth it. The table was easy to assemble and I love the 40\" height that easily fits over my adjustable bed. Also the top has a slight lip which prevents things from sliding off. This really never worked out for my husband who is disabled. We put this together and no matter what we did to make sure everything was screwed in really tightly it was still really wobbly. So we never use it. We are pleased with this purchase.  My husband found it easy to assemble.  The wheels are sturdy and roll well across the carpet.  I am able to adjust the height effortlessly.  Be sure to measure the clearance of the furniture you intend to use it with.  We knew ahead we wouldn\u2019t be able to use for the couch.  You need the 3-1/2\u201d clearance.  We highly recommend. Table seemed nice enough but gave only three stars because I could not get it to  raise up and down. Table seemed pretty sturdy and was very easy to roll. Overall nice table but ended up being worthless because I could not raise it to fit above my Mother in laws hospital bed to allow her to eat with more ease. Bought this for my wife who had  shoulder replacement surgery which keeps her in a harness 24/7 for 6 weeks . It has been fantastic for her while sitting on the couch or in bed . It allows her to conveniently  eat , read or use her I-pad . It is just as good as the ones in the hospital only more moveable and less cumbersome. ", "This table was just what I wanted for after my surgery. I wish the top was stronger, but only having the leg on one side I don't see a way around that. Pretty decent table. This was sooo easy to put together. I was Leary as 1 reviewers stated she needed  a drill. You will need pliers and a screwdriverr.  I put this together in 45 minutes And I\u2019m a female. Good sturdy and Purchased this for a family member who had recently had a stroke and has paralysis. This table was light enough for her to move on her own but very durable. Her physical therapist also comment on how great this product was and stated she would recommend it to other clients. Great purchase! The instructions for assembling the table are clear; however, it doesn't come with the tools necessary for putting it together.  I guess it is assumed that most homes have tools. So far so good.  Not sure how sturdy it will be.  The chrome mounting screw doesn't seem to fit properly as I can't tighten it.  Otherwise easy assembly. I use a hospital Bed at home and I got one of these. Liked it so much I got another one for the other side of the bed. Adequate for home use. We wanted one that could slide over our bed and this one is perfect. Roomy but not too big, it is easily adjustable up and down.  Sometimes slides down faster than moving up so be careful when adjusting with items on the table. I like that the dimensions make it easy to fully slide under the bed and have the table right over ones lap. I like the table. It has a nice finish and trim and it was easy for me to assemble with only a screwdriver for 6 screws, and a wrench for two bolt screws. Perfect for my computer at my bedside. I hope it holds up. I'm very happy with this purchase. I bought the table for my wife who had a surgery requiring an 11\" incision in her abdomen. She used it to eat on and hold some books, and as an added bonus, it also kept our dog from jumping on the bed. It's good quality and less hospital-looking than many of the other ones I saw on here. ", "I use the table to do 5D Diamond Painting on it as it allows you to sit, but if you get tired sitting you can raise  it to stand.  We also use it when one of us is ill, we can just move the table where ever it is needed. It took 5 minutes to assemble, it\u2019s Good quality, the castors are free flowing and lock upon desire. I don't understand how this can be recommended by doctors when there's a Prop 65 warning on the product!!! Amazon doesn't mention it on the item description, which is very alarming and also disappointing because they're legally obliged to mention this. Definitely returning! This item is garbage. The adjustable mechanism is stuck in the lowest position and will not move. Had to be replaced but not with this brand. Amazon should not endorse this product! People that had problems with lowering/raising table didn't pay attention to the directions about switching screw. I bought it for my friend to use because she had to spend so much time in bed.  She loved it and could not believe how inexpensive it was!  Great deal! Bought this for laptop use.  The ability to adjust height was the reason I purchased this item, but this feature needs some improvement.  Unfortunately the spring loaded \"locking\" handle does not lock very well.  It takes very little force to lower or raise the table even when the handle is not engaged.  It is very frustrating to have the table readjust on its own simply because I may have kicked my knees up a little bit, or put a slight bit more weight on it.  I would expect the \"locking\" handle to actually lock the table in place, but it does not.  Definitely would not purchase this table again. Table was ordered for my disabled husband to use with his lift chair.  It doesn't roll under his chair but  we are able to angle it so it gets close enough to work. It provides more sturdiness than what we had been using. I think it was worth the money. Excelente producto, por mi condici\u00f3n de salud necesitaba una mesa que pudiera mover f\u00e1cilmente. Esta cumple con lo que necesito. F\u00e1cil ensamblaje None Item arrived on time and was easy to assemble.  I love this table.  I work from home and sometimes I move to my bed and this table is awesome!  My roommate loves it to so I am going to buy another one for him.  Really well made and sturdy and at a great price too!  Win win for me. ", "My FIL who is 94 needed a table that was adjustable that could be used beside his bed. We love this table because we could make it the height he wanted and because the base is off center the table can actually come o RF the mattress (lengthwise), making the table more within reach. We don\u2019t use the wheels as the table is alongside the bed, not across. It\u2019s OK but I thought I would be more durable. Wish it had better support for the table top but it is good for light use. Could use a drawer under the top for light storage, but other than these it works well. This was not difficult to put together, but you needed to read directions, but there was a screw they called a transport screw, which was to be replaced by a chrome screw, which was not in the box.  I ordered 2 of these because my wife was going to be in a hospital bed at home.  Both boxes were missing the same small screw....lol.  Now neither has the missing screw???/ I'd give it 5 stars if it was just a little easier to adjust the height. I unthinkingly  put a 15 pound dumb-bell weight on the unsupported end of this table, and the table handled it well with no sagging. So I was impressed. Good product but wish I had researched more for a nonmanuslraise and lower device. Would have been more useful to lift or lower with one touch vs manual process requires both hands and arm strenght Maybe mine was the odd one out, but the supplied bolts that hold the base to the upright support were too short and the threading was messed up/too big for the bolts, rendering the entire table useless and a waste of money.  Tried to find replacement bolts but the threading was an odd size so that didn't work either. I purchased this for my mom to use while in bed and she loves it.  It was easy to assemble and it's just so handy to have around. Quite solid, which makes it very usable. A lot like the ones used in hospitals. No regrets at all about buying this. It should last for a very long time. Bought this as a gift. I put it together with ease. It has made the recipients life much easier. She could not physically move a TV tray and the wheels glide this nice table aside when exiting her chair. ", "Locally, for a table like this, would be over a $100.  Ordered it and came in quick (to Hawaii).  Assembly via instructions were easy. My friend is bedridden with a cast. She needed a sturdy, dependable hospital type table to fit over her in bed. This was easy to assemble and is performing just like a hospital table. The price was right and the quality good. After working with the table for a few days I am not very happy with the product because it takes two hands to get the latch to work right and to raise or lower the table which defeats the purpose of a hospital type table. I have had the same table before which worked a lot easier. I am using this as a stand for my laptop so that I can rotate standing and sitting while I am on the computer. I'm  disappointed in the stability of this table, as it  wobbles as I type, just enough so as to be quite distracting. Secondly, I cannot get it to raise and lower. For some reason, the lever on the side just doesn't work so it is stuck at one height. I am not happy at all with this. I don't know if perhaps something wasn't done right when my husband assembled it, but I wouldn't purchase this again. with being at home during these trying times this allows me to comfortably research my home projects and recipes.............. Great bedside table... I use mine on a carpeted floor, hence it does not roll as easily as it would on a solid surface. I love this multipurpose bedtable and highly recommend it. It is a good quality sturdy piece that adjusts to various hieghts, easily glides across the floor, and the wheels lock for security purposes. I am a caregiver to a bedridden patient and having this table has been so helpful to me in many ways. Bought this for an elderly person.  It\u2019s very easy to assemble.  Raising and lowering it is very easy.  Has wheels so you can move it from room to room. Is not Formica type of covering on Table. Looks like some type of material sprayed on or it is a plastic covering. Sliding mechanism is poorly designed as you can wiggle the table top back and forth without the base moving leaving it unstable and wiggly. A person would have to shim the plastic insert to stabilize and eliminate the wobble. If I wasn't needing to use it in 3 days  I would return. While putting together this product posed some challenges, I am pleased with the resulting table.  It has some instability towards the rear of the table, as most of the weight is there, so one must be careful to not overstress it while it moves or gets jostled, but after seeing some of the other vulnerabilities of other tables on the market, I feel this is acceptable if I keep the issue in mind during use.  It is a very good size, and rolls well on its legs without the halting/sticky movement I had in other tables that spilled my coffee regularly!  It goes perfectly under the bed and couch I use it for, and I don't have to twist to use the computer I use on it.  When I got the table together, it was pretty stable and solid on the mast, so another good thing after using other tables out there. ", "This table is ok, if you don't lean on it.  It really isn't heavy enough to lean on if you're getting out of bed or pushing your weight on it.  It will break.  If you're careful, it will do fine. There's no way to assemble the table.  It does not come with any of the 6 mounting screws or the bolts. Presumably the wheels were supposed to be boxed, but they arrived unhindered throughout around the main box. When I opened the box and pulled out the products I noticed there were no tools to put it together. No bolt, no screws, no metal plate. There were also no wheels to manuever it around. Clearly, no one did a quality check or it was a used product that they passed off as a new product. Sturdy well made table and base. The wheels made it to high to fit under my couch. So my original plan to move it between bed and couch wouldn't work. I still use it by my couch with out the wheels on a rug to slide it without the wheels. I  like it. I bought this table in order to place medical supplies on. The table was put together by a mother of three by using a screwdriver and a wrench. It took her about 45 min. The table was large enough to fit all the items on but be sure it's big enough to accommodate your needs. The table looks great and was easy to set up. The problem is that we can no longer raise or lower it. It\u2019s broken after only about 3 months. No option to return or exchange at this point so I have to order another one that I can raise to fit over my mother\u2019s hospital bed. Item has been used gently in a home setting so very disappointing that it\u2019s broken already. My husband was recovering from neck surgery and couldn\u2019t lift anything. So I decided to buy this table. I was able to put this table together in about 20 minutes. Very durable! Very nice, sturdy, easy to assemble.  Even comes with locking wheels, very small lip on top of table perfect so things do fall off but not too big to be annoying.  Lever to raise and lower works well.  Easy to assemble.  Be sure to remove packing screw before attempting to raise or lower top.  Use another screw to permanently locate table height.  Perfect for me for typing level at lowest height. Durable finishes. Love this table! This has been a wonderful table to use while I am recovering from a broken arm surgery. It moves well and I really like the adjustable height. Sometimes it feels a little insecure when I press on it  as I move but that may be because we don't have it tightened correctly. I would recommend it My mom is immobile, and we got this as a back-up from the Hospice bed table. This one is really nice. She likes it. Uses it to keep her devices and book on. ", "I was skeptical when reading about this, but I took a chance. I am so glad I did. I\u2019m on oxygen and I\u2019m an artist. This is so perfect for everything I need to do We use this for our laptop when we are in bed. High enough to fit over our really tall mattress. Works perfectly. You have to be careful rolling on carpet but that is to be expected with casters small enough to fit under the bed frame. Just support the tray as you roll. Very easy to assemble, great and easy height adjustment, and easy to maneuver.  Works great for my son, who is bedridden with both legs and one arm broken.  Definitely recommend Wheels are difficult to put in properly, but otherwise it's great and once you get it put together it works well. This table looks cheap but is sturdier and more stable than I expected. It took a few minutes to put together. Of course, it is pretty unattractive. But at that low price relative to the competition I really can't complain. I just hope it lasts the six months we will need it. So far, very good. Actually bought it for wife who is confined to a recliner chair but it was a little too high to work well without any modifying. Although it is designed for bed use, I use it once in a while to work on laptop while in recliner chair.. IT SEEMS STERDY ENOUGH FOR WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR..... Well-made product.  Easy to assemble.  Rolls on carpet no problem.  Simple to raise up and down.  Tabletop is a bit slippery, so I place a piece of that rubber, web-like, shelf liner on it so plates and glasses don't move around (makes it much safer for people who have to eat in bed).  Did some comparison shopping, and this was a good price. This was easy to put together and works great.  Used it while husband was recovering fro a major health issue Worked great and was easy to put together. My husband had knee replacement surgery and we used this both beside the bed and beside a recliner until he was more mobile. It made life so much easier. Well with the money. Made the recover for my daughter after an auto accident so much easier for her as she had to stay in bed, and eat in bed, and do school work.  Have no use for it now, but it did it's job, and then some. ", "This table has been a HUGE HELP to me.  I am disabled & I needed this for a long time!  I put it off because of cost.  Then I found this!!  It's sturdy, secure and just overall terrific! Thanks so much Amazon!! It is made of partial board which is not sturdy . I feel if you rest on it it would come loose from the screw which in theory should hold onto the particular board. Google partial board and you will  see how it is made Kind of flimsy but does what you want if your just going to eat from it. I use this for home medical needs and find it just as good as anything you'll find in the hospital. The working surface is great and wheels around very easily. Nice and sturdy and moves up and down. Very happy with this purchase! I was reluctant to purchase this thinking it would be too wobbly, cumbersome, wrong size, etc.  Not so - it rolls easily, rises up and down with little effort, not too heavy, and has plenty of room for meals or any other use. Helped my sweet husband when he needed it he is gone to his reward now and I am sure he is face to face with Jesus, This looks as well made to me as the Medline. I hate to assemble anything but this was a cinch! I use it in my bedroom for just about everything. I have a very high bed and it adjusts to meet my needs. Nicely boxed with instructions, easy to assemble (you\u2019ll need a crescent wrench & Phillips screw driver, both not provided). This item was for my mom.  She cannot get out of bed and needed a tray table so I purchased this one for her.  She really seems to like it.  My husband put it together and I guess he didn't have any problems with that!  The table is very large and sturdy. ", "I ordered it to use as a night stand when I am in the sitting up position with my adjustable mattress. It works perfectly. It was easy to assemble and sturdy. The room has carpet so it\u2019s a little difficult to maneuver but that\u2019s not really an issue to me. I find that the table is a little flimsy where the table connects to the stand. I would suggest adding glue (not included) to the 6 screws to help make it a bit stronger. Other than that if's a nice table. no problems with it raising and lowering.... Nice table for the price anything better will cost 100's Great quality The table is exactly what I needed. Our bed is very high due to box spring and mattress combined. However the max height of this table is enough for me to lay on my bed and use it. The assembling is very easy. My eight old son help assembled this ( I did help a bit with instruction). This should be like $15 cheaper. Then it be perfect. It works well and it was easy to put together. I use it as a laptop desk. Wheels move with ease. Raises and drops easily. I bought this to help us with care for my elderly mother in love who was convalescing at our home. So convenient and helpful when it was time for her to eat or read or whatever. Definitely worth it. Table is a nice size - not too big, not too small.  Have been using for 3 weeks.  Rising mechanism works well, finish is nice.  Black bead around edge of table keeps items from rolling off.  Only problem is the casters - they are just set into the table legs, so, if you lift the table at all they fall out and you have stuff tumbling off.  You have to be very careful to always slide the table very slowly. Not quite as big as the one in the hospital, but that is OK. Easy to maneuver.  It has been serving as my dinner/TV table ever since I came home from the hospital 4 months ago. The wood grain laminated top isn\u2019t the prettiest. Would be great if it came in colors. But it went together easily and is doing its job very well. I have used this table for my online school work, which gave me plenty of space to work. It was quite easy to move from room to room and very sturdy. I would recommend to anyone in need. ", "Excellent table.... wish it came with the wrench to tighten everything without having to go hunting for the right tool.... otherwise very satisfied. This is a surprisingly sturdy table and a very good value. Adjusts and rolls easily. It has come in handy for a medical issue requiring a lot of bedrest It\u2019s feb 16 , my husband uses this tray every day. And today it broke! It will not lock into place it keeps falling. I\u2019m heart broken now I have to buy another It isn\u2019t sturdy. I would have spent the extra $40 and purchased it one through a medical supply store. Great table.  Easy assembly took maybe 10-15 minutes.  The table works great!  The up and down adjustment is smooth and holds position as it should.  Great table. Package received damaged. Table corner broken!! Cannot use. I bought this for my mom after she broke her hip. It\u2019s exactly like the one she had in the hospital. I actually want one for myself so I can sit in bed and do office work. Took me just a few minutes to put together and works great! Mother-in-law has been using it for her laptop and loves it! We purchased 2 carts at the same time. After just 2 months, 1 of the carts would not longer adjust up or down.  After 3 months, the 2nd cart would no longer allow the ht to adjust - it's stuck.  Very disappointing and a waste of money! I bought this to assist after foot surgery, I really like the quality and that it is easy too move without tipping over.  Nicely made and sturdy, adjustable height is a great feature ", "Bought this for my mother in law as she is at a care center that did not have enough to allow her to have two of these in her room. Great value for the money. She loves it and it was quick to assemble. The lifting mechanism malfunctioned. Return for refund This table worked great. The only thing that I had minor trouble with was that it is rather stiff when you try to lower it. You need push down directly over the lever side. Kinda hard if you're stuck in bed. Might just be a matter of breaking it in. It's not like the ones in the hospital that go up and down smoothly, but still works fine and not nearly as expensive as hospital grade tables. Good material, great finish, easy to move around, but it wobbles. Do not fit the purpose, either my home patient's meals will fall to the floor, or the table will break on him. great table for laptop and monitor.  easily raises and lowers and is very sturdy.  wheels work well.  took around 5 minutes to put together and super easy. Works great for home health situation at home!  We use it as a sturdy table for many purposes.  It serves as a table, to write, eat, and more Table was a life saver after my surgery it was intended only for that but still around has been helpful with crafyd and dog cuts due to the adjustable height and good quality firstly the table began to rotate separately from the metal supporting column which makes it difficult to move it. I assembled it easily myself but there is no way to tighten the column to the table top when it started to move separately. The table top and the metal columns are sturdy of itself but as a whole system didn\u2019t eork properly. I'm very happy with my purchase. The only thing I wish was different was the the small table was secured flat. Because it's only pressure that keeps the small table level, with a good push it can move. Other than that - I'm really happy. It raises pretty high - if needed- higher than I expected. But I needed it to do it's perfect. This table is being used by a person in a wheelchair. She is able to easily move it where she wants it and also adjusts it to the height she needs. It was easy to assemble and works exactly as described. We are very happy with the purchase. ", "The table is very unsteady, hard to maneuver. The lift part stinks it's hard to adjust. The table is cheaply made, waste of money. I will not buy this table again or recommend it to anyone. I bought this based on buyer reviews.  I'm glad I did.  It's high quality, easy to assemble--took 10 or 15 minutes--excellent instructions. The surface is smooth and has a very slight lip that will help with things sliding but won't interfere with resting arms on the table.  Very stable and raises and lowers very easily. I bought this for my husband because the one I previously boughts table was too short. The mechanism to lift the table does not work at all \ud83d\ude21 Even had my neighbor try and get it to lift for me and even he couldn't get it to budge. I have had a lot of trouble with this table.  The mechanism for raising and lowering the table does not function properly and so the table is stuck in one position.  This is very inconvenient because my wife who is paralyzed has to adjust her legs so she can use the table top. Item is made well , easily assembled.  It is perfect for  our needs at a affordable price. This is not wood, but super sturdy...Looks high end, but great price...LOVE IT I wish it was a bit deeper or wider.  The 36inch length is good but I would have liked it to be 6 inches wider or deeper. Great table.  Fast delivery.  Easy to assemble (and I'm a klutz at assembling stuff).  Performs as advertised.  Love it. Perfect! Exactly what we needed. I took the wheels off so it would fit under couch. I bought some of those furniture sliders at the dollar store and it works perfectly. I used 3 layers of the furniture stickers to ensure perfect (well it's perfect enough for us and have had no issues from an unbalanced platform) balance This was for a Senior who is bed ridden. It is so very useful. It is very Sturdy. I myself was able to assemble!!!!!! ", "product arrived with zero assembly instructions and a medium gash in the top.  too heavy to send back at this time.  partially unhappy.  seems sturdy though I use this table to do computer work on and it's the best! Strong, fully adjustable, cleans easily and rolls properly, wheels lock and unlock, it's just unbeatable. I love this table. The wheels are total junk and we took them off as soon as we put them on, but even with that this product is 5 stars. I got it to use as a more stable tv tray and it has since replaced the coffee table. Love it. Highly reccommended. Single 64 YO female could easily put this together, biggest table top I could find, easy up/down lever. I love this table. Before I was using a TV tray beside my bed and chair. This is so much bigger and with the wheels easier to move. This so helped me in recovering from surgery.  Even though I can get out of bed now, I'm still using it.  Our bedroom is carpeted and the reason I took one star away is that it takes some effort to move it away from the bed when in the bed.  It raises and lowers just fine.  It looks exactly like the picture and was delivered as promised.  Good product and good company! This adjustable bedside tray was a lifesaver for Mom who just got out of rehab. It was very easy to put together and moved up and down with ease. It also moves easily from room to room. Best decision I\u2019ve made in a long time. Not only is it good for my bed but also to use at my recliner chair Lightweight, sturdy and looks as advertised. It was easy to set up as I followed along with the video online.  Purchased for my Mother for ease of maneuverability around the apartment and for her bedside at night. (She is a recent stroke victim...I have her meds, a monitor and various provisions etc, right by her side for direct access at all times.) The lever does not seem to be working on mine. I properly installed it and I cannot raise the height at all. ", "I use it to work and eat in bed. I added a laminated panel (extra from my floor installation) to the bottom (legs) to hold my laptop when not in use. I also add a magnetic mouse holder for my mouse to the vertical supporting leg.  It is the most functional table I have ever own. As the bonus, it is also beautiful . Well built and easy to assemble, good quality but tray was very wobbly and moved every time something was placed on it.  No adjustments possible.  Bought it for my wife coming home from hospital but too unstable to use. It was a great buy.  My husband had an unexpected knee surgery and this is fantastic. My husband stays in bed all day and he has a hospital bed and when the top is elevated he can't feach his items on the end table next to the baed so buying this was the answer for sure...I also rolls easily on the carpeting.... No issues with shipment, damage or defects. Typical hospital room gear. It's what I expected. Together with my adjustable bed, I am getting such fond memories of being laid up in Hospital...but without the post-op pain and medication fog. Excelent for after surgery.  I have been immobile for six weeks.  This table helped me to eat and do work from the place I was healing. Works absolutely perfect for my father in law. We use it for living room chair. It has very few parts and I thought what could go wrong. It took just 20 minutes to assemble but it does not work. One of the wheels is loose and keeps coming out. The height adjuster does not work at all. Something seems to be jammed inside. I have to return it. The table arrived when promised and came as described.  It is sturdy enough for my needs. This is not a particularly beautiful table/desk, but it has so perfectly met my needs that I can't help but rate it 5 enthusiastic stars. I got this table to serve as the desk to my laptop. When I went from desktop computer to laptop, I found I was sitting in bed a lot with it rather than at my desk. Doing this meant I didn't need a big desk somewhere, and so I set about finding how to get comfy computing from bed. I had tried a few things, from a cooling mat, to a folding lap desk to a cheapish plastic lap desk with a beanbag bottom (the latter of which I still use for other things, like my mouse, tablet, etc.) but I was having trouble making this 1. Comfortable 2. Accommodating to my large and powerful laptop while in use and having it also be easy to put someplace else out of the way 3. Affordable 4. Not heinously ugly. ", "Enjoying the new overbed table.  Great buy.  Every bit as nice as the one he had in skilled nursing facility. This bedside table was easy to assemble with well illustrated images. It goes up and down easily as well. I bought this table because the first one I bought was a nightmare to put together.  But just watch their online video and follow those steps and in less than 15 minutes I had the table put together and functioning perfectly.  I would highly recommended this table to anyone looking for one for their loved one. Perfect addition for many reasons.  I am disabled and I can take things out of the refrigerator and walk it to the counter.  I can take the wash back to the laundry room and transport things throughout the house that I can no longer carry.  It's great for meals, reading the paper, writing cards and the like.  It is well made, rolls super easy and was an outstanding addition to my mini hospital set up at home.  I highly recommend this handy table. Nice product. If I can put it together-anyone can!! Makes my husband's life a little easier. Very pleased for the price. This  is the second Medical Ajustable overbed.  My daughter put it together in 10 minutes. Everything is working just right including the adjustable mechanism to make it go up or down. Happy with it!!!! Bought for my mom after a hospital stay. Easy to put together, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s very sturdy. Wife is pretty much in a wheel chair.  Use it for everything over the course of the day.  Sometimes meals, putting on makeup, handy side table.  East to assemble, height adjustment works easily, casters work well for movement. Works out fine. Just a bit short when over the bed for dad to eat. l wish it was longer but over all it\u2019s great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I give it a thumbs up Bought this for an elderly family member. It is strong, sturdy, easy to adjust and I am very pleased. ", "This one a great!! Chair can fit right under table. Table height adjusts. Really great. After a couple months of use, the table is wobbly and slanted too much for use. Product is easy to assemble. It comes with clear assembly instruction. No issues at all. Seems pretty sturdy as well. Looks nice and fair priced, but there was a weld on the up right tube that would support the table from collapsing that was terrible and broke during installation, so I had to re weld it. I use this sitting at my oddly shaped sofa. Quite impressed with its stability and solid construction -- considering that there's only a few things to screw in. Looking forward to seeing how long this lasts. I bought this table for my mother she is bed ridden it's just like TE one used in hospitals it's long and wide enough to use ,you can put a lot on it and use it for so much more she loves it. I purchased this item mainly for a mobile table for my computer monitor - Worked out as I expected This table is just what my husband needs as he recovers from open heart surgery. Yes, it is an over-bed table, but it also nicely moves aside, and holds the things he needs near at hand. It is lightweight, but not cheesy, and was easy to assemble. I am surprised of the quality of this table. Heavy duty build quality make this table very stable. Instruction where simple and easy to follow and assembly took about 10 minutes start to finish. Just what my husband needed. He has MS and this works great for him. ", "Had to return it unfortunately only cause husband didn't like the size. I am a caregiver for a man that had a stroke. He uses a regular queen size bed. The tables he had in his room forced him to bend over to get things. I got this table as a gift for him. Omg. He loves it!!!! He is a happy camper now. He is able to adjust the table up and down with his one working hand. The way the able was made allows him to use it ove the bed or sling the side of it. Thank you First one I received was broken along the table edge, my return was quickly processed and I order another one.  It arrived last night in perfect condition.  Instructions are not the greatest but it was fairly easy to assemble based on the pictures and numbering of parts.  Purchased for my mom and she was very happy with it, it does go up pretty easily but shouldn't be an issue for her.  The tilt feature is great for when she wants to color or write letters! The table meets my requirements and seems to be of good quality.  Assembly was simple and easily done. My first order was damaged in shipment and was returned.  No damage to this one or its packaging. much more difficult to assemble than i thought.  however once it was done, it is really great and useful for our household. i even use it\u2019s adjustability to type on my laptop at eye level.  i now own two of them. I wanted a table like they use in hospitals, and this is it. Went together easily, with (I think) just a screwdriver. works perfectly, easily fits over a hospital bed, or chair or couch. Excellent product easy to assemble. Bought it for my 91 year old mother. We bought this after my brother absconded with the one we were using for my elderly mom.  It's big enough that we are actually using it as a sewing table now. Great item and even better customer service. Unfortunately I have to spend a lot of time in bed due to some health issues and this table makes life much easier. Love it ", "Works like a charm. Easy to assemble. Seems sturdy enough. Does exactly what I need it to do. I liked the height but its top heavy on one side which makes maneuverability difficult. I gave it as a gift to my brother-in-law . The receiver liked it but the draw back is when assembling it, it lacks the tool necessary to assemble it and complete it.. It's a special tool that not all owns one. Quick shipping and great little table.  Good company on the ball this js just as described.  a great strudy and easy to move cart.. now i can wheel anything.. my cat loves it. A bit difficult to attach the mast to the base- it was hard to get the second screw threaded in on both rolling tables.  But I managed after a while on each and have enjoyed the comfort of using them to eat while watching tv.  They\u2019re quite sturdy for their purpose and seem to be good quality products. My wife broke her leg and needed a table for the bed side. This was perfect. We move it to the den when nobody is visiting. The adjustability was perfect I purchased this table so I could work from home while on bed rest.  It is very sturdy and easy to maneuver with or without the wheels.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to pull off the \"mobile office\" I needed, but this table allows me to be reclined or even laying down with a slight incline and still use it with my double monitors and mouse. I'm using this as a I write on my laptop.  Strong, sturdy, outstanding value for the money.  Easily put together.  Key is not to overtighten the screws that hold the table top on. Make them snug, but not tight.  Very happy with this purchase. I was able to assemble myself.  did not come with tools but I had tools myself.  Very pleased with table and has great height for what I wanted to have for my chair.  Would recommend ", "After being quarantined, I needed a desk to work from home and the desk I ordered was going to take several weeks but this arrived quickly and worked wonderfully! It is very versatile and I'll be using it for many things. I'm currently using it to do a small puzzle! ;) Just what I was looking for. So nice I had to purchase another. Love this item Arrived quickly. Good product but does not let up and down. Needed it for a hospital bed at home. Adjustable and good size. Very satisfied with the product would recommend it to anyone Having read previous reviews I was anticipating some difficulty assembling this table. However, by taking my time, I was actually able to put the table together in under an hour without any problems (my recent total knee replacement surgery slowed me down). The table is very sturdy and made from solid materials. I am pleased with this purchase and believe I will be able to utilize this well, during and after my recovery. I use it at my bedside, my lift chair and at my sewing chair. I pay bills and do all my paperwork on it. I love it. This table fit perfectly in the space. It's not large and bulky.  It works fine for a side table, the bed it adjustable with both head and feet lifting up. Great buy and a good price is very well made and very easy to assemble. I roll it from room to room with me and is large enough for laptop plus more. I am planning to buy second one. It's very functional. ", "Sturdy. Well packaged. Pretty easy to assemble with the right size Phillips head. I think the screws would be better as Allen fasteners with an Allen wrench included for assembly, because two screws are so very close to the mast. Product is adjustable and portable.  Except the table top is not so sturdy. I was very disappointed. Initial few weeks it worked perfectly.  Later on I could not adjust the height at all and it the lever seems to have just stuck in one height/position.  Seems to be defective piece.  It is a major effort for me to try to return it.  I have discarded the box as well and stuck with it now.  cannot use this for actual purpose intended for. Good quality for price point, easy to assemble, sturdy. Could not secure base to mast because the holes did not line up. Had to drill out (make oblong) the holes in the base before I could get the bolts to match up. NO FUN. NOT GOOD for a medical device. This table was indeed easy to assemble. It is a light table and rolls easily most of the time. It lost a star because one of the locking wheels occasionally locks itself while I am moving it. Don't roll your eyes I don't know how it is locking itself. This is not a heavy duty table and is not sold as one but if you are looking for a table that is height adjustable for light duty use it will serve your needs. So keep reading for my update. Just lucky everything was there and nothing was damaged by delivery.  The box was torn and dented, screws and wheels were rolling around inside. I have not put together something like this before, it was so easy and my grandpa loved it. I liked how easy it was to put together using just two tools. I Table seems sturdy. However after our set up. The table doesn\u2019t go up at all, it is stuck in the down position? 3 screws on one side say don\u2019t remove, so no idea how to get this table to go up and down. Used over hospital bed.  Patient not there yet.  Appears to be fine. ", "Cheaply made, using cheap materials, resulting in a cheap little table. Love it! Super handy and great for working in bed. I got this for my mother just to have one. Its nice, thick and sturdy. Very nice. Bought this due to my 91 y/o mom had a stroke. And a lap tray was not a option.  Does the job it\u2019s intended to.  Easy to put together.  Definitely a asset. Great bedside or couch table Great deal for the money. I wouldn't put a ton of weight on it, but it works great, and doesn't break the bank. No issues with assembly. I thoroughly enjoy my product, however I am reluctant to place much weight on the outside portion as I have very little trust in the 6 screws in the particleboard. Easy to put together.  Not the most rock solid construction but worked exactly as expected.  I was satisfied with the table. One of the two bolts provided is messed up making it impossible to tighten all the way.  You can\u2019t screw it in correctly (in either of the two holes provided).  This means that the bar holding the table is very unstable at the base attaching the wheels and wobbles a lot. We use this table as a TV type table in the living room.  Lots of room but, not too large.  The only thing that keeps it from a 4 or 5 star rating is the fact that it is a bit flimsy.

I bought it because I'm recovering from surgery and spend a lot of time in bed, but now I'll use it all the time.  The top is large enough to hold a dinner plate, drink, books and laptop computer.

However, at this time, it has not cause concern that it will not stay together, it\u2019s just slightly rickety. Extremely nice table. I would recommend. It isn't quiet the industrial version like you see at most hospitals. It isn't fragile, but not that strong either. Just don't overload it. Make sure the screws are tight, and don't be rough with it. It will get the job done though. Nice home bedside or chair-side  table.  No issues so far. This table works great, the low profile wheels fit great under the bed. This works great for serving food and meds, helps my mom use as a side tray to her recliner as well. Instructions are very inadequate.

I have another one upstairs by my bed. My husband loves the tilt table. He wanted a rolling table for the bedside large enough for iPad, cell, paperback books, glasses, large extension cord (held on w/Velcro) for chargers, small basket for pens/pencils, etc. and several other items. The tilt feature is perfect and the price was good (shipping $$$ though). The instructions could have been clearer for me (!) but once he got it figured out all went smoothly. A plastic floor mat on top of the carpet makes it roll very smoothly. Its okay for the price but a bit unstable sometimes and the bottom screw keeps coming out. that may be my fault not tightening enough. the wheels are terrible. One wheel didn't roll which makes it hard to roll the table. Otherwise exactly what I was looking for. Super easy to put together. Would have give 5 stars but if the wheels would have been better quality. Casi todo me agrado. Pero creo que pudieran marcarle un espacio para poner el vaso de agua o botella, ya que es muy lisa.

This table is very sturdy. I put it together by myself.  Simple simon. ( needed to be for me LOL ) Not disappointed at all actually was thinking I would get another at some point and time. Great product for the price. My husband had shoulder surgery so we used this so he didn\u2019t have to reach for anything. Just placed his meds or drinks on this table next to him. He loved it. perfect for my dad in assisted living facility Wow, solid build and incredibly useful in a number of scenarios and environments Table was easy to assemble and looked nice.

No longer will adjust up and down like other compaints.... I ordered the over bed table for my elderly mother. She loves the fact that she can push the table away herself when she is finished her lunch. She sits in a recliner most of the day and the table has really come in handy for meals.  It was very easy to assemble and very good quality. I would definitely recommend this table. When putting the table together many of the screw holes didn't line up, so it's missing some of the screws that hold the table to the metal frame. Very pleased with this purchase so far.  Assembled in a snap.  Just the right height to slip over recliner arm.  Best one I found in my research for the price. Excellent fit it is easy to move around Just what I needed to help my bed ridden maw in law. Might have liked to had one that tilted, but this is a nice set up. This unit was easy to assemble.

Screw keeps falling out of the bottom and tabletop tilts downward. Would not recommend. Works great This worked great for almost 2 months, but now the lever for lowering and raising is not working well. So frustrating.

Nice bedside table.  Took about 20 minutes to put together.  Instructions not very clear.  Remember to remove the small screw to allow the table top to be adjusted in your desired position. It's fine, works as advertised. Assembly took about 10 minutes, half of which was devoted to getting 2 of the wheels to seat all the way into the bottom arms.  The materials are sturdy enough, but the table's a bit wobbly because the vertical support is in 2 parts and the screws at the connection can't be tightened any more or they'll strip out.  The dark top is nice, doesn't show stains. This tray was easy to assemble, glides easily and has two wheel locks when you want to slow it down. I'd give it 5 stars if the finish wasn't shiny. The shiny finish creates a glare from overhead lights, TV or if you're working on a lap top. Other than that it's a really great product. I put a cork sheet on mine to cut the glare.

It looks like FURNITURE (not like a hospital setting). It will not fit under all beds/furniture. The table itself worked well for a few months.  Just be careful if leaned on.

When I want to work on a puzzle, I set it up in my  living room, it is the perfect size for my puzzles.  It withstands my leaning on it to work on my puzzles, and my cat jumping on it to help me with my puzzles.  It is a very sturdy, very nice looking table, and I intend to keep it for a very long time. I bought this as a family game table in the house. It is not only perfect for card and dice games, it is the perfect table to set up my easel and paint at. The height is a great height, and works for the really tall and kids. We have also started using it occasionally as a dinner or lunch table. It folds up very thin, but still has a hefty weight. A great, sturdy table. Dinner- dungeons and dragons-oil painting canvas. Good for everything Came in great condition, no scuffs. Folded out easily and does it's job, of being a table. One of the legs on the table does not close properly the first time we used it. We can get it closed, but the metal bends instead of twisting on a bolt like it is supposed to. It will work for the time being, but after a few uses will most likely snap, rendering the table useless. Included are photos of the faulty leg as well as one of the good ones. I will be seeing about a return assuming I don't have to pay for shipping on this defective item. My husband & I recently moved into a much larger space than we previously had, & we hardly have any furniture to fill the space with right now. My husband wanted to have a game night for his birthday, so I bought this little table for us to use that night. It's a great game table. We've used it more than once while having people over for game nights, & it's even doubled as a props/craft services table during a weekend of filming in our home. It can get a little wobbly if there's too much weight on it, but other than that, it's proven to be worth the money. Plus, it's super easy to set up & take down. Table came with torn/damaged top. Other than that, it is just an el-cheapo card table, suitable for puzzles or Lego kits. Too much hassle to return. Judging from other reviews, torn tops are a frequent problem. Recommend: DON'T buy this one. I bought the table after reading the other reviews because it was on sale for about $23.00.  I figured it would be fine for that price.  It arrived on time and although the box was taped up and nothing was wrong outside, sure enough, 2 corners of the vinyl top had rips in them. I was kind of expecting that because so many other reviewers had the same experience.  I need the table for a Mah Jong game tomorrow, so we will see how it goes.  It is a tiny bit smaller than other card tables, and a little low, but hopefully it will be just fine.  After that I will use it as a puzzle table, as others here have done. This is a good sturdy table.  It has a padded top which makes it great as a card table but not as ideal for a work table.  I prefer the models with straight legs to these slightly flared but can no longer find one with the same easy fold legs.  The only problem with the softer top is that it is more prone to nicks and pokes if one is using it as a work table.  To be fair its primary function is to be as a card table - just not in my house.  We do crafts not play cards.  The best part of it is that it is reasonable in price and very sturdy.  No shakiness at all. I bought 2 of these tables for Bunco. They are good tables and the dice roll VERY good on them. The problem with them is the vinyl had tears in both tables. So I returned the tables and Amazon sent replacements. The two replacements both had tears in them as well. Very disappointed because I don't want the hassle of sending them back again to get more that have tears in the corners. Not sure what to do. If it weren't for the small tears in the vinyl I would've given 5 stars because I really like the tables. It's a good  price for a table, but the table legs are not straight. The table sits okay alone, but if you want to butt it up to another card table, the flared legs get in the way. I bought two of these tables, because I was setting up five tables , in a line, no spaces in between them, for Thanksgiving dinner. I had to secure the legs of these two tables together, crossing them over one another, in order to line up the tables. So, if you want an okay table to use now and then, this is okay. It's sturdy and lightweight for the money. But it does have its problems. I would not buy them again, nor can I really recommend them. Note: In the Q&A it says the legs are not flared. ", "I took a chance on getting this table as \"used\" from the amazon warehouse and I was kinda worried it might have a torn vinyl top but it got to my house well packaged and it was in great shape! The only thing I could find bad about it was just a few minor scratches on the metal edges of the table, no big deal to me. I am very happy with this purchase, vinyl is in great shape and it is perfect for doing my puzzle on, which is what I bought it for.  It is shorter in height than I expected but it will actually work out perfect for sitting on couch while doing my puzzle on it, perfect height for that. These tables are perfect for holding food and presents at a party! Which is why I bought them! The cushion top is great and they are fairly durable for being made from thin metal and thick cardboard. As a cat, I have to say,  this table meets all my kitty needs.  I can hop right up on top and the table doesn't even wobble when I pounce.  There is a nice padded top that is Purrrfect for sharpening my kitty cat nails with.  My only complaint is there is a good amount of space and my human keeps putting her craft supplies on my table.  Luckily it's big enough I can stretch out and knock things off if they get in my way.  My human can easily fold this right up and slide it away for easy storage.  Lucky for me she keeps forgetting,  giving me ample time to destroy the lovely top with my claws.  We both highly recommend for the price. Your cat will love it just as much as you ! product arrived late, roommates at least found it before it was stolen left at my door a week after it should have already arrived and I was out of state. Legs to the table splay outwards becoming tripping hazards. In fact the one or two times we use it we kept knocking it the table over spilling drinks all over the games we were playing. Pretty pissed off on that. It is also with A cushy top rather than just a smooth surface. The other function was to use to draw on and it can\u2019t even do that because of the squishy nature of the surface.  The surface itself started peeling right away. Very inferior manufacture I ordered this and what I got was not what the photos and description stated. It is not padded, and the top is not 1 solid top. The top folds in half, which is great if you are planning on storing it the majority of the time, but not great if you had planned to use this for puzzling. There is a cm wide gap down the middle where the top folds, in which puzzle pieces can esily slide into, and onto the floor. I specifically got this one because I had thought the top was 1 solid surface, like the picture show. Iwas also looking forward to the \"padded top\". Very dissapointed about this. I have not contacted the company yet about this, but I plan to. False advertising. Do not buy. Well packaged and no assembly required. Legs fold down and open easily. Using as a work table in my office. Perfect size and fits the bill. Pleased with this purchase. This table came with a small cut in the fabric of the tabletop cover, which was a little annoying. But it was off to the edge and for the price it didn't seem worth it to return it and get a new one. It works as an extra table top. My only real complaint is that the top is very squishy, which makes it hard to use for anything like crafts, since you need a hard table top and this is definitely not that. I know most folding card tables have a somewhat soft top, but this was softer and squishier than any others I've ever seen. We have a temporary accomodation and we will have to move and get rid of all our furniture within a year. So we buy folding and camping furniture now. This table is quite spacious and sturdy enough to serve a dinner. Or you can probably put a small TV on it. The surface is soft but pretty easy to clean. But It's not suitable to use as a desk. First, it's a little lower than an average desk. Second, and the most important, problem is it's not as sturdy as a wooden desk so when I type on my laptop the table vibrates constantly, making the screen jig a few millimeters up and down. It's pretty tiresome. It's ok. The legs snap open easily and it's lightweight. But I expect the top will not stand the test of time, as it doesn't seem to be secured to the frame very well. My table arrived damaged, as well. I'm unable to determine if this occurred in transit or not. It's not for heavy objects; my flat screen monitor made long-lasting imprints in the faux leather topper quickly. For puzzles, I think this will work well. I wouldn't want to subject it to any kind of regular open and close use on a regular basis. I've been looking for a table for the kids homework for a while and have had some purchases that were not what we really needed. So, we decided to get a \"low risk item\" which turned out to be the best. It is soft, but we use the plastic pads and it works great. Easy to move around and adjust the room for various purposes (which is especially true in today's distance learning environment). And it matches pretty mush any type of furniture arrangement/style already existing in a household. So, very pleased. Who knew, such a simple product fulfills the need so well! ", "I was really hesitant to get this table since so many of the reviews showed tears in the vinyl top, but I guess I was one of the lucky ones that had no issues whatsoever.  The table is fantastic.  Super sturdy, easy to set up and easy to break down, and there no tears whatsoever. It's not made out of wood, legs are flimsy so if you are the type of person who likes to rest your arm at the table while eating, look else where i bought it for playing Mahjong with my friends. It satisfies all my needs. Easy to fold and unfold. Not heavy at all. I can put it away when I dont need it. When I unfold it, it is steady and not shaky at all. I like the surface of the table very much ! The hand feeling of the surface is so comfortable. When we play Mahjong on the table, there's no loud noise since the surface is soft. Unlike other plastic or wooden table I bought before, there's loud noise when we play Mahjong on them. Perfect size! I ordered this table for my Rescue group! They do pet adoption events and they were in need of an extra table not too big or too small. This was just the right size for all the paper work that they do! It\u2019s super easy to open and close it ! That\u2019s exactly what they needed ! Something that they can open and something that they can close and store since they have no space! For the price this is a great table. Quickly and easily folds and sets up, it is sturdy and serves its purpose for an extra table when needed. It arrived very quickly, was well packed, no damage. All in all exactly what I needed and as described. How long will it last I dont know, but since we will only use it as an extra table when needed, it wont get used a lot so it should last a long time! She has been looking for a padded table like this for months, read the reviews and took a chance.  Got it October IIRC and itr sat in my office-she knew it was for her but she thought it was some of my photography as some of my work is simlar in size of the box it came in.  Needless to say, but I am saying it anyway-she is extremely happy.  ;) I had to discard my old card table as the legs kept collapsing. So far this table is as good if not better than the one I discarded. It seems very sturdy and is very handsome. I bought this for vacation. We needed a card table. It was light which was nice to travel with, however it was a giant piece of crap. The legs weren't sturdy and when we went to fold it up. the metal hing just BENT instead of folding so it's now a giant paperweight. The support metal is too thin. Wont' be purchasing this one again anytime soon. Yuck. The quality for the price is amazing.  It is sturdy, folds in a second and is lightweight to carry.  When using, it is very steady and has a cushiony top which makes it comfortable for card playing.  Highly recommend. Table arrived damaged in two corners.  The material covering the table top was ripped/missing in two of the four corners.  Too much hassle to send back because of the size, but very disappointing.  Hopefully the tears won't get any bigger. ", "This was a gift for my mother. She uses it for putting jigsaw puzzles together! She loves it! Would absolutely buy again! Very sturdy. Padded table top. The leg feet come with padding , so doesnt scratch my wood floors.  Fits a 2000 pc puzzle easily, could probably easily fit a 5000 pc.  I bought it for doing puzzles and works great, but would have also liked a hard top. But still very happy. Fast shipping also!! This table is nice looking and definitely holds up to it's name. Great for card games and board games. However, if you're looking for a table to work with stuff, or you want to play games like Jenga, avoid this table. The soft foam on top is nice to touch, but anything with weight sinks lightly into the table. A laptop is at risk of overheating on this thing, for example. And it's a little shaky if you're building any kind of project. Not impossible mind you, but there are better choices. Setting drinks on it isn't a problem. If you just want something to play Poker, Magic the Gathering, or Monopoly, then this table will do just fine. Using this as  a make shift desk while hubby works from home over the next few weeks, easy to put away after he is done. This worked for our needs and will make a great temporary table when need be in the future. Good buy overall. Legs seem a bit thin but we shall see, glad we chose it. use this as my computer desk. the soft top is great, seems breathable as my arm doesnt sweat while on it.  isnt the MOST sturdy thing in the world but its taller than other desks and the legs lock in place firmly.  if you're taller and need leg room i recommend this.  the softest top ever. For the price this table is stable, reasonably sturdy, and looks good.  In accordance with it's name a \"card table\" is meant to be lightweight, easy to set up take down and store, and used to support playing cards and drinks rather than engine blocks.  This table does the job well. I guess it's a decent deal for the money, but the table arrived with the padded top already torn on one corner.  I'm keeping it, but just be aware that this is not a high-quality item.  Maybe look for one with a solid, not padded, top. It's a great table for board games. It's got a lightly padded vinyl top, so I'd recommend a coaster underneath the wine glass for a little extra balance, but all in all, it's a great table. This is a great card table. Have used several times since purchase. Bought to replace kid\u2019s table set for growing granddaughters. Nicely padded top. Great price. Would highly recommend. Leg broke after first use and now can't return due to it only having a 30 day return window ", "This is just what I needed to be able to do things with my granddaughters, and then put it away since I\u2019m in the Mobile Wheelchair I can\u2019t have a table in the way. I love this table. Arrived all dinged up  with corners dented.  Supposed to hold 130 lbs. Put a computer on it, on its side to work on. The table sags. Very, very nice, well-made card table. I deducted one star simply because I personally don\u2019t care for the spongy top. I use card tables for extra eating space or for writing, not for playing cards, so I would prefer a harder surface with less \u201cbounce.\u201d Still, this is a sturdy, good-looking table, which sets up and stows easily. I ordered the table and 4 chairs as a set and realized the table was going to be too small for the type of card game being played.  I ordered a second table from the same manufacturer and I couldn't be more pleased.  The chairs are very comfortable, even sitting for 3 hours as we do, and the table is really easy to set up and take down.  The table and chairs are built well and are very sturdy.  I highly recommend this card table and the chairs if you want to get long term use from it. This arrived in perfect condition. Easy to set up. We just needed a small table to play games and do puzzles with company over the summer. This is a good size to leave open (with an unfinished puzzle on it) in our family room. We just tuck it into a corner when we're not using it. I'd be careful about putting any hot mugs or plates on the top because of the vinyl top, but coasters or heavy place mats should help with that. For the price, we feel like we got a good deal. I think the price for such a universally useful product is great. It looks nice, even without a cover, but due to the padding on top and the purpose for which it is to be used, I would recommend a thick tablecloth to protect the plastic. Easy to move, easy to store, and the height is just right. Highly recommend. Tables are great. They can be used to put clothes on, have yard sales and even eat your food off of. This table has multiple uses and it is more loved with each one. Great buy This table is fantastic. It's the right height and the perfect puzzle table. I recommend cutting a side of the box it comes in so you can spin the 1000 piece puzzle as you work in putting it together. This just like the card table we had when I was a kid. I ordered for my husband because he was looking for something to do his puzzles on without usurping the dining table. This card table works great for that. The table is great! However, I didn't realize it was a soft top. I thought it was a hard top which is what I wanted to be able to do some writing for work. Ugh. Oh well, we can use it for other things.... ", "The table arrived with two small tears in the vinyl covering on the corner, which is not a big deal.  The table was easy to set up and is sturdy.  However, the table has a strong chemical smell that is hard to get rid of.  I kept the table mostly because it's large and bulky and would be a challenge to get to the post office. My husband and I use it to play backgammon in the evenings. There are a couple of the legs that are a bit difficult to fold. I can do it easier, but my husband suffers from a joint disease. Other than that it is a great table. Pretty solid product.  CAUTION: Be careful folding down table.  The metal bends if you apply too much pressure or weight to close. Use this for a picnic station in the park with no complaints.  Light weight to carry but solid when setup.  Very happy. Thank you! The table is very well made. It is padded, but it is hard to put puzzles together. You need to push down on the pieces to get them to go together and then others pop up. I like it. I bought it so my cats could have their food up off of the floor, and their litter boxes are hidden out of sight underneath it. Not a usual use for a card table, but hey!! Works well!! I have needed this and it is a great table.  I am very excited to have a strong table that will do the different thing I need from it.  Great price and quality. I haven't put the chair up yet because me and my boyfriend are moving soon, so once we setup my eyebrow area in our townhouse, I'll update the review! Great purchase!!! Got it today for a dinner and game night. I ordered 4 chairs from Costco to go with it. I was impressed with the packaging and here's a clue.. The more you practice playing with the legs folding it up, the easier it is to fold. Great purchase. The Perfect Card Table: It\u2019s a good table, but I should have thought more about the padded top, since I wanted it for doing jigsaw puzzles!  The padded top does not serve well for pressing puzzle pieces together.  My bad! ", "I recently downscaled to a smaller home and need additional eating space on occasions. This table is perfect and I need 2 more and I will be set! Not too heavy for a 70+ year old to lift and move and the legs go down (and up) very easily. I would not call it \"heavy duty\" but it is perfect for extra dinner guests and can be stored easily under a bed or in a closet. It has a very nice top as well. I love it! I place supplies from my office on this table and it is perfect for my needs. I need a variety of supplies in my tax preparation business and it is perfect for my needs. I shopped and shopped, this product was the best price AND was just as high quality.  I use these in my office for working with kids.  It is strong, lightweight, and easy to put away. It\u2019s sturdy and nice but super small. Only big enough for 2 people or as a puzzle table. Don\u2019t get it if you are having people over for a get together and need a place for people to sit. This is a nice card table, the best part is it gets delivered to your door which makes things easier.  It's not exceptional, but does the job and good for the price.  Each leg was different in it's ease of pulling out or going back into the folded position, but they all worked just fine. Shortly after I got this, I set it up to do a puzzle. The vinyl-like covering had a torn corner by the end of the first hour. Needless to say, the table was being used for a puzzle so it wasn't being used recklessly or aggressively. I recognize this table was not top of the line, but I thought we would get more than minimal used before it was damaged. I needed a kids table for the holiday's and this is a perfect table. No need for a table cloth but I use one anyway for the kids. Quick shipping and price is good. I recommend this table. Bought this to do jigsaw puzzles on while on quarantine due to COVID-19. Easy to open and close. Perfect size for 1000 piece puzzles. Good, functional table, but like others have said, it arrived with a small tear in the table top. A bit of electrical tape will hide this tear, but my guess is it\u2019s like to tear easily in the future. Terrible. One of the legs broke as I tried to fold them back down - which they do not do easily. Save your money and buy something else. ", "I liked the cushioned leather top it is very sturdy Had to returned - all busted up when we got it I use this for puzzles and it's got a cushion top so it's not as easy but the table itself is OK. I haven't tried to fold it up yet. The legs not only angle outward (as shown in photo), but were at odd angles in their locked position.  Although heavy, the table didn't seem sturdy or stable - decided to return it.  With their usual off-the-chart customer service, the return was handled with amazing ease - even though I had set the table aside and forgotten it during a time I was traveling a good bit.  Within an hour of having dropped the table off at a UPS store, Amazon had already issued a refund.  Am I the only one addicted to Amazon??? Set up a duplicate bridge room a couple years ago and we bought 10 card tables that were terrible.  We so wish that these had been available then!  These have the nice soft tops that make it easy to pick the cards up off of them. I currently use a very old folding card table as an indoor work table for various projects.  It has gotten wobbly and I needed something sturdier.  I really like this table, except I overlooked the description that said the top is padded.  It's not padded very much, but I would have preferred a non-padded surface. The quality is apparent just taking this table out of the box.  The black color is perfect for playing cards I ordered this table without reading the reviews. It arrived in a box that was torn and when I open it it was ok. But when I got ready to let it down one leg would not go down the metal piece turned the opposite way. The top of the table started to come apart. This was a gift my husband loves to play cards. Playing on a hard table your wrist and hands will start hurting. This soft top makes that impossible to happen. Recieved quickly. Less expensive than the store. Works well for cards, puzzles, or even extra food at parties. ", "It'll be quieter while playing Mahjongg because of the padded top.  Nice looking table. I'm happy with it. Price is very good Arrived in perfect condition, folds flat as a board for storing, a very reasonable price. Just what I wanted. Do not buy this, it\u2019s extremely flimsy. Mine arrived with 11 of the 12 brackets that attach the frame to the top ripped out & bent. It\u2019s easy to see how they didn\u2019t stay attached because the underside of the table is about as sturdy as cardboard and the brackets are very lightweight. As you can see in the pictures, the table top doesn\u2019t line up with the frame. Overall I\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s an \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice\u201d Pretty decent folding table. Can do better with sturdiness and price. Bought this one on Amazon then found the same on Target 10 dollars cheaper. Great table to achieve that extra surface you seem so often to need!

I ordered this table for cutting fabric on. Very sturdy and well finished.  It's a snap to set up as you just unfold the legs and it's rock-steady, and the padded vinyl top is a nice touch.  UPDATE:  The vinyl is quite thin and tears easily from sharp objects like cat claws.  I've ordered an elasticized cover for mine. So far it\u2019s ok. The top is soft! From some PU squishy foamy material! We have it on our balcony. It survived few lunches, coffee breaks, 2 rain storms and it still works. No idea how long it will last, but we don\u2019t have it for long. PS: I would not put glassware on top, it\u2019s too soft and squishy. You\u2019ll need to use some place mats (I\u2019m using cork place mats). Received this today and am disappointed.  Two corners of the box were smashed which tore the vinyl top. It is not worth the trouble to send it back so I will keep it and try to cover up the corner tears with black tape. I am only going to use it for working puzzles. Nice table, nice price. I was stupid for ordering when I did (protests.) Waiting on UPS took longer than quoted but it is here. I bought it to make jigsaw puzzles on. Its the perfect size and light enough to turn to get to the other sides. Its easy to set up and take down. The only negative quality is the top is padded with vinyl top, so it holds air, which makes it hard to set the puzzle pieces in place. Great table, perfect puzzle table which is why I bought it.  It DID come with a tiny tear in one corner just as several people posted in their reviews, but it was not worth the trouble to send back and I just put a tiny drop of glue on it to keep it from getting bigger and you can't even notice unless you are looking for it. Seems to be very sturdy. Everything as expected-except the material on top of table. Very thin stuff-very easy to tear. ", "When this item was purchased it was in stock almost 2 weeks later nothing. Now they say OOS. I got this for my dad, who is in a skilled nursing room and needed a place to set up as a desk. I was very disappointed in this product.  It might very well be a nice table but the one I received was bent and a corner of the table top was torn.  I had read a few reviews about other tables arriving damaged but there were many more positive reviews so I thought I'd take a chance.  I'm sorry I did since returning is such a hassle. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it does have a terrible chemical smell at first that takes a few days to dissipate. It stunk up the room. Really nice auxiliary table. Inexpensive but not cheap This table is easy to fold and unfold, and is sturdy. The top is padded and soft so if you wan a hard top, you'll have to either look for another table or put a board on top if you want to have a solid surface for any reason.

This desk caught my eye.  It is reasonably priced and could double as a side table when not used as a desk. It arrived 2 days ago and unpacked it tonight. I had some concern from reading other reviews because of damage but mine was fine. I took pictures of the process as I know I find these handy when deciding on a purchase. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'm going to put it in a 1 bed apt. It will be used for a side table for a lamp and fan and when needed take a counter stool from the breakfast bar as a desk chair for privacy. There is no tools needed to install it at all. It was nicely packed and had no issues putting it together in minutes. I could easily put it in a closet if we didn't want it out. I could also put it in the living room as a side table as well. Nothing real fancy, but looks nice, functional, sturdy and easily transported. I would purchase it again. I love this desk! It is just the right size, sturdy, and extremely easy to assemble. The assembly pretty much consisted of taking it out of its box, opening up the frame/legs of the table (the are already screwed together and ready to go), and snapping the table top into the frame. Done! It is lightweight, portable, and looks perfect as an office \"corner\" in my bedroom. I absolutely love my desk. I use it as a makeup table. Its easy to clean and fits so much on it. Putting it together was very easy all i had to do was snap the top to the frame. No tools at all were needed id repurchase for this alone. Its a great desk/table. I bought THREE of these tables for my craft room (in progress). They\u2019re perfect for my needs. They\u2019re durable and compact when folded up. I would purchase these again and again. I love this desk! It was so easy to put together and I love how simple it looks but looks sooo nice! The fake wood top doesn\u2019t look cheap at all and I\u2019m usually very picky about it but it actually looks nice! It\u2019s also very sturdy! As you can tell I also have the matching bookshelf! I would definitely purchase more if they had more products in this line! Desk is sturdy, nice looking, and cheap. Surprisingly sturdy considering the price. Extremely easy to assemble - like my grandma could do it easy. For the price of around sixty bucks, this is an outstanding value.  It is extremely easy to assemble; I was done in five minutes and it required no tools or glue.  The desk is surprisingly stable and the top, while thin, does not feel flimsy.  The only downside--and it's a small one--is that the faux-wood-grain texture of the top can make writing on a piece of paper difficult, especially using a ballpoint pen.  It doesn't interfere with using an optical mouse, however. Firstly, I was not able to setup the desk out-of-box. One of the joints of the frame was not properly tightened and would not fit the table top. I had to loosen up the joint and re-tighten it. Amazing desk. Works fine, looks fantastic, will not hold a lot of weight. Seller has been harassing me with emails for a month straight asking for a review. Well here it is. We converted the \"Play Room\" into more of a teen room by selling the Train Table and in place putting this AWESOME DESK!  My son is soon to be 14.  This desk is fantastic.  It took mere seconds to put together.  It really dressed up that room quickly.  I bought a chair similar to the one that is pictured with it (the white one with wooded legs) on Amazon as well.  Great prices.  Highly recommend. ", "This desk is easy to set up, and it looked firm and nice at first. However, after a few days, the wood became bent in the middle, where there were only a laptop and a monitor. I did not ask to return or replace the item because the box it came with has already been disposed of and if this is how the desk was designed then a replacement won't make much difference. Apart from being worried about that the desk may break, I also wonder whether the desktop was made from recycled materials and may contain harmful substances given its unfirm properties. None After read alot reviews I wasn't sure if I should get it \u2615 but y'all, I love my friking new desk \ud83d\ude0d If you live in apartment, this is very friendly. Doesn't take too much space & for thoses who like farmhouse & industrial decor, this kinda style of desk fit perfectly. Awesome price, fast shipping, easily to assemble & beautiful. Just know, the desk have like a \"contact paper wood\" on top but I don't mind honestly. I have it in my living room & I like how is matching my decor perfectly. Goes well in this space. I highly recommend. Did I mentioned just took me literally 5 minutes to put everything together? Buy it & you not going to regret \u2615 All the other reviews are spot on for the desk.  The desk takes seconds to put together.  The frame is pre-assembled, and the top has clips that just pop right onto the frame.  The desktop has to be flipped a certain direction or the clips do not line up.  I thought it was defective, but turning the top around solved it.  You do need give it a hard tap to get into place. This is described as a table, but tables are not supposed to be flexible. The surface is flexible and won't support more than 15 pounds without warping.  Also, this \"table\" is described as a writing desk.  But the surface is grooved, so good luck writing with anything besides a Sharpie.  I bought because of the 4.6/5 rating, but now surmise that rating is mostly paid for.  I would rate 2.5 given the price, but the current rating makes this seem more like a scam and I feel compelled to warn others. Overall a very good foldable desk. I bought it to use as a drawing table, but since space is limited, I wanted something that could be folded and put away in the corner or under the bed. This fit that purpose very nicely. Seems to be very sturdy and I also love the wood grain finish (even if it's not actual wood). The only thing that stopped me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that the table top tends to sag just a bit in the middle of the desk once it's in its unfolded state. I noticed there was a little nub in the center-rear of the frame where the table top meets the frame. This is the only thing giving this desk support in the middle. I've remedied the sag by placing a piece of paper that I folded several times over so that it was about a half an inch in thickness and I placed it between the nub and the table top underside. This propped it up enough to eliminate the sag in the center of the desk. If the design could be updated so that the nub was about a half an inch taller, that would be a most welcomed fix. Overall I am very happy with it, however! None This item was very disappointing.  The desk top/table could not be attached to the metal frame because the plastic snaps (attached to the bottom of the desk top, do no line up with the metal frame. The desk/table also arrived scuffed in to places, so it already looks beat up.  I cannot even rig it, so it is completely unusable. I\u2019m super impressed with this desk! Absolutely adorable and it took 5 minutes to put together, not even kidding! All you do is clip the board onto the stand! Great quality and decently priced, will definitely be buying another in the future. man, this is the most elegant and portable study desk I have even seen. It might cost twenty bucks in its material and production, I am willing to pay the full amount for it, and buy one more if needed. It is sturdy, but it comes with no screw to secure it, its surface has been very carefully treated/designed, it is not smooth, yet an optical mouse works very precisely on it, it gives a feeling of warmth in its touch and elegance in its simplicity. If there is one thing I might suggest the designer to do is to add a small drawer underneath the table to hold pen pencil eraser stapler etc. That can be easily done with the current package and design without sacrificing the sturdiness and portability of the desk. ", "Arrived quickly and was packaged well. Here's some pros and cons: Not worth it. Though easy to assemble - I\u2019ll give them that it\u2019s just awful. The edges are too sharp to sit front of and the surface is too rough to write or draw on. One bar was bent and though we could force it into place the whole desk is just crooked. I\u2019m going to toss this one out and start over. Very easy to set up (just take it out of the box and snap it together - no tools required). Great value for the money. Can't really think of any cons about this desk. Most of the cons other reviewers are listing could have easily been avoided if they just read the description such as: \"small desk/not enough space\" (the dimensions of this desk are literally in the item description, maybe measure your intended space out before buying furniture) or \"desk is flimsy/can't hold a lot of weight\" (it's a $60 desk I'm not sure what other people are expecting for such a cheap desk). All in all it's a basic $60 desk and it does what it's supposed to do. I bought 2 of them for my kids so they can do their homework and play PC games. Like most fortunate souls, I am now working from home due to covid-19 and I needed a small desk to fit in the corner of my living room. I have a small one-bedroom condo and not much space. I needed something that did not require assembly, was attractive, and had enough surface space for 2 monitors and a keyboard! I am so glad I found this desk. I sincerely hope this company starts to make more furniture pieces like this that don't require assembly (e.g. tv stands, round coffee tables). It's a dream come true! It arrived in few days and the box was packed perfectly and lightweight. The UPS driver was able to carry it up one flight of stairs to my condo with no problem. It took less than 10 minutes for me to unbox and assemble the desk. The base unfolds and the top snaps in place via small brackets/clamps. The legs are sort of wrought-iron. Overall, it is a very strong and sturdy. The top of the desk is a faux wood with a tile-like texture. I couldn't be more pleased. I waited 2 weeks before I wrote my review because I think it's important to try things for a while. It's flawless. You won't be disappointed! Thank you Coavas! Previously bought one of these desk. Liked it so much I purchased another. The 2nd one had a bowed top (manufacturer defect, poor QA from factory). I bought this table six months ago. When it first arrived, there was a scratch on the surface of the table, which was not very strong. I found an important screw missing during assembly, but I bought it at a local hardware store (because I was very anxious to use it at that time). After half a year, the table legs began to fall off. I really thought it was a failed shopping. Don't buy it. While the design and price seemed great, the table I received had defective hardware. Two of the four pieces designed to \"snap\" together easily are defective/the wrong size. Returning/shipping back such a big piece is a hassle and I had already thrown away the shipping box. I tried to hack it together but it's no use.  It's taking up space and I'll probably just to throw it away Very disappointed. It was inexpensive and makes me feel like it was my fault for not ordering a higher quality table. Wow, what a great table for $56?!  The best part is took me literally one minute to put it together. Bought one for each guest room. I was honestly so tired of having to do work at the kitchen table because I didn\u2019t have my own desk. I had been researching different desks for a while because I found it difficult to find something that looked good, fit my needs, and was still within my budget. Then I came across this desk. It wasn\u2019t as heavy as I thought it would be when it finally arrived. I pulled the parts out of the box and there was only two, the tabletop piece and the frame. It\u2019s super simple to put together, I did it in less than 5 minutes. You just need to unfold the frame and put it where you want it and then you snap the tabletop on top and it\u2019s done. It feels sturdy enough for my needs and it doesn\u2019t feel or look cheap. I\u2019m easily able to fit a monitor, a PS3, the PS3 controllers, and some basic office supplies on the desk and still have sufficient room for something like homework and laptop or a book. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE THE EXPERT INSTALLATION THAT AMAZON SELLS FOR THIS TABLE!!! From taking the pieces out of the box to having a fully functioning table LITERALLY TOOK A FEW SECONDS TO BUILD- all you do is unfold the legs and snap-in the top of the desk via the two snap clamps on each side and it's completely ready. ", "I really wanted to love this product after all the good reviews I read online but there are a few issues which are not disclosed in the product description. Setup was quick, but here are the issues: I love this desk! I have a small room so I was looking for something sleek and low profile. This desk was assembled in under five minutes (with most of that unwrapping the packaging). The box came undamaged but this thing is so sturdy I wouldn't have worried if it had. I ordered this desk and it took 3 days to arrive via FedEX.  They left it on my front porch around noon this afternoon.  I had asked my 15 year old son to lug it up to my bedroom and put it together for me because I am far from mechanically savvy.  However, my son was still in school when it was delivered and I am quite the impatient sort.  So, I carried all 27 lbs of the box up my curving staircase and into my bedroom.  It really was not that heavy, just a bit cumbersome because of it's length and width.  Once I got it out of the box, I was able to put it together in no time flat.  There really is no assembly whatsoever.  You unfold the metal \"housing\" and then you place the wooden piece that serves as the desktop onto the metal \"housing\".  I was thrilled that it was unbelievably easy to have a desk in my room almost instantly after opening the box!  I really didn't want a large desk because I was putting it into a corner of my bedroom and this is absolutely perfect.  I took a picture of the actual desktop where I place my macbook.  I definitely have enough room to get an IMAC which is my next purchase.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't need a huge desk, anyone that does not have someone to put together a desk or anyone that loves simple things that actually look amazing and function perfectly!  This purchase is one of my best.  I love it so much, I just got a second one that I put in the corner of my family room.  So now I have one in my bedroom and one in my family room! I needed something small for occasionally working from home but didnt want to spend $150-$200 on a desk. Sure enough amazon comes through again. $50 for a great looking desk that took me 30 seconds to put together. Ironically my brother was putting together a drawer from ikea that had like 100 pieces and made me appreciate this desk more. Good things is if I need more space I pop the top off and fold away. Students, business folk, artist I recommend this desk. As you can see in the pic, we ordered two of these and put them side by side so my partner and I can work in our small space. Here's how we set them up: I was in dire need of a new desk and I didn't want to spend over $100 for one. I am so glad I got this one when I did, honestly the only trouble I had out of the desk was getting it out of the box because somehow the tape was attached on one side and I seemed just not strong enough to just get it out. (That's more of my fault but the tape from the box shouldn't of been like that) Other than that, set up was easy and I LOVE the leg room, very spacious! I personally hate the bars in between the legs that most desks have and since this one doesn't have that makes it even more perfect for leg room. Plus best part is that I know it won't be a pain when I move since it's fold-able and definitely easy for transport. I was excited for this bad boy until I opened it and assembled it I had to fix a few things There was one teeny-tiny ding in the top of the desk out of the box, but it isn't really noticeable. I bought this desk to have in various places throughout my home to work on my school work. Sometimes I like to be out working in the living room with my husband while he plays xbox, sometimes I like to be in isolation in the office. This is perfect for that. It's small and compact enough that I can break down and put together on my own and light enough to carry from room to room with no issue. I did buy a desk mat to protect the top since it isn't solid wood, but that doesn't seem necessary with the finish that's on the desk itself. I'm not using it for anything heavy, just my laptop and notebooks/binders, so I can't speak to how much weight it can take. It is really sturdy though. I searched on Amazon for a nice quality (relatively low priced) desk and my budget was around $50. Most of the desks I saw on Amazon didn\u2019t have very good reviews (about 3/3.5 stars at best) and were said to be \u201cwobbly\u201d or \u201cunstable\u201d. I have a 7 month old son and I was concerned about him maybe knocking it over ( he climbs on stuff nonstop) or that it would be a purchase that would last 2.5 seconds and break. Some people had good reviews of the other desks while some people didn\u2019t; it was basically 50/50 in terms of pros vs cons for the desks that were in my budget (also the assembly time was around 20 min to 1 hour for the majority of them, which isn\u2019t that serious but I wanted the best deal all around. I wasn\u2019t going to assemble something that would only collapse later). I then saw the star rating for this desk and indeed, it is worthy of its good rating. Very high quality (which is so important), assembling it took me about 3 minutes (all you do is unfold the legs and attach the top), very sturdy, and doesn\u2019t take up a crazy amount of space (also the leg room is very good). The piece of wood for the top is very nice and thick, and again, very good quality! This is my review for now and if an issue comes up in the future I will be sure to update it. If you\u2019re looking to buy a simple good quality desk (which also looks quite nice) but don\u2019t want to spend a ton of money then this is the desk for you! We purchased this desk based mainly on its design (i.e., that it did not require assembly), as well as the reviews confirming it was super easy to assemble. Once the desk arrived, it was indeed very easy to put together; we didn\u2019t run into any issues snapping the desktop onto the frame. As another reviewer pointed out, it was harder to unpack than assemble. ", "I bought this for my in-home office as a laptop desk. It\u2019s excellent. Easy to set up, literally my 5 year old figured it out before I put it together, and it\u2019s great quality. I have a set of file drawers that fit under it too, so saved more space that way. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and was worried about leg room when I bought this, but it\u2019s got plenty of leg room and it\u2019s comfortable. I\u2019m not folding it away but if you need to do it, it\u2019s quiet compact when folded. It can go behind your bed\u2019s headboard or under a bed easily. I once bought this really cool floating desk but due to my dyslexia combined with horrible instructions, I ended up building it both backwards and upside down. It traumatized me. Also ikea. Several years later, I found myself wanting a large office suite but I never found anything I liked. So I\u2019m on Amazon one day looking and trying to calm an anxiety attack imagining building a desk again. Low and behold, I saw this desk. It looked cute. I saw reviews with ideas of how to arrange two together. I thought why not give it a try. Got them in, and snapped them together in 2 minutes including opening the boxes. I am so happy. They are obviously not upscale but they are cute. I\u2019m going to put the bookshelf with some file folders next to them and use that for the next year or two. I got some cute velvet chairs and have a nice cabinet next to it. My office isn\u2019t what I originally imagined but everyone thinks it\u2019s super chic!! I'm in love with this desk! The ad copy says it's for urban, busy, young people. Well, one out of the three ain't bad. I live in the country and am retired, and only COVID has kept my activities down. This desk is perfect for someone like me who lives in a small apartment and still wants a roomy, attractive space for writing. This desk is completely stable and sturdy for my laptop and peripherals, notebook, coffee mug and other odds and ends, and I have plenty of room for my DeskCycle underneath. I also bought the matching bookcase. I set up my office in the small guest room where I also do my yoga and meditation, and if the pandemic ever ends and I need more space for guests, I can easily snap the top off, fold it up, and slide it behind a door or under a bed. I have my laptop, printer and small speakers on this desk with room to spare.  I would recommend this for college students or anyone who might move year to year.  This desk would be great for campers also as it can be easily folded and transported.  I looks nice and is good quality.  Perfect height and excellent for the price.  No complaints at all.  It matches any type d\u00e9cor and is one of the best purchases I have made.  Where I go it will go.  If I have company in my smaller home I can fold it up and put a cot or rollaway bed in it's place.  A real space saver. Very durable and well made. This desk is excellent!  I work from home and although I have a designated room for an office, I wanted something that would allow me to comfortably work in our general living area occasionally.  It was difficult to find something that was large enough to work on but small enough not to be intrusive in a living area, looked decent and was sturdy.  After looking at multiple options \u2026based on other reviews this was the winner and it has not disappointed. I love the look of this desk! Legs are modern and the top, though obviously not wood when you touch it, looks nice and doesn\u2019t have the appearance of plastic. Could it be any easier to put together? Unfold the frame and snap on the top. Simply brilliant. It arrived a week before the estimated delivery date. Works great for my laptop, plus I have my Apple computer (in the monitor) on the desk top and they both fit. Note there aren\u2019t drawers for storage, but I will be using this as a laptop desk and don\u2019t need anything for storage. Very unobtrusive. It\u2019s currently in the corner of my living room, but I\u2019ll be putting it in a spare bedroom to use as an office. I paired it with an adjustable height office chair from Ikea. It\u2019s already received complements from visiting family. Love it! This desk was for my office at work, I needed something I could move easily if needed. And put away if needed. It is perfect for a laptop a pencil holder and a paper tray.  It doesn't wobble like you'd expect it holds it own pretty well and I visually enjoy the surface. Unfortunately, this desk is just too cheaply made for the price. This was easy to assemble and really sturdy, as you just pop the top in and it locks the table frame in place.  This is sturdy enough to last a while and work with it safely.  I like this sturdy fake wood, which appears real at a glance, but seems easy to clean and maintain.  The wood is more like a medium ash brown, which blends easily with similar wood tones.  There is literally no screws or need for tools, which is a plus.  This can also be easily repackaged for storage and transport.  I would highly recommend this for small spaces, temporary living arrangements, and for relocating frequently due to grad school and internships. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. It's small and attractive but cheaply made. Not even sure the vinyl covered desktop part is wood underneath. ", "Maybe the seller can correct me if this is wrong, but there is a serious design flaw with this desk, It has absolutely NO support in the middle. I can flex the very cheap particle board with just my hand, as you can see from my photos the \"support piece doesnt even reach the board on my desk, plus that is only on the backside. THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR THE FRONT LIP OF THIS DESK!!! I honestly dont know how long it will last, or if i'm going to keep it since I really, really like the size! Easy to put together less 5 minutes. Flimsy and cheesy. Very disposable looking desk top. The table top is a wrapped in wall paper like wrap and any pressure to the top it will bend. The support bracket to keep it from bending  is at least 2 inches from the table top. No support whatso ever. Worse I have to pay to send it back! This product is way over rated. Believe those bad reviews. This is the second time I have purchased something that had a 4 1/2 star review and did not listen to those bad reviews. Had I have listened to my inner voice of reason; telling me not to order I would not be writing this review right now!  Don't order. Those bad reviews are real.  If you want something functional,that will hold up overtime (sturdy and classy) pay the extra money and get a good desk that will last. Also note, there are so many good reviews on this product that it can be misleading when viewing. First time shame on you second time shame on me. Sending back lesson learned. Definitely will pay more attention in the future. I bought one desk from this seller. When I got home I had very limited time to assemble it, my college class started in 30 minutes. I opened the box, pulled the desk legs out and the top part of the desk. The desk legs are already assembled and only need to be unfolded. The top part of the desk clicks on to the desk legs. It is surprisingly stable! The wood of the desk is smooth, no need to worry about hand blisters. Setting up the desk took no more than 10 minutes, that also includes taking out the leftover trash. Seeing how It looked and how it was holding up I decided to buy two more. The price is such an amazing deal! Now I have three desks in my room. One for my coffee maker, laptop, wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, and other pens. The second, I like to keep empty and use for paperwork. The third, I have all of my electronics like my 55-inch flat screen tv, under the tv I have all my everyday devices charging, under the desk I have Storage cubbies with my PS3 and games. I highly recommend this desk! I bought three after all! I may consider buying a fourth Desk! I'm a highly organized person and like to make the most of the amount of space I have in my room. These made my room look more comfortable. Hopefully, the seller sees this review and offers a discount for the fourth desk, as a college student it would be very much appreciated! The table, in theory, is easy enough to set up. You simply unfold the bottom legs and then click the top surface into position. The issue is that the hooks that the tabletop is supposed to slide into isn't sufficiently engineered, so you have to jostle it into place. This desk looks wonderful near my balcony door. Great natural light while working and the texture of this desk feels amazing. It's extremely easy to assemble. My husband was not home at the time it arrived, so me being anxious I put it together myself and it took less than five minutes not kidding. We love it and it was worth the purchase. First off I ordered a desk earlier in the year and it is great that is why I order another.  The  2nd desk was ordered I received the desk I unboxed it set it up but noticed it was shorter than my 1st desk I purchased I wanted them to be flush to make a longer desk.  I returned it and I received a replacement the next day.  Well here we go again the desk is still shorter by 1 1/2 inches it doesn't sound like much but it is for me.  I decided not to go thru the hassle of doing another replacement so i am  just keeping it. I purchased this as a 'summer office' desk in this new work at home world, with the idea that it's design would let me quickly stow it in the closet to restore my guest room configuration.  (My normal home office is in a room that gets too hot in the summer for long hours). Folds away for easy storage or to take with you. Comes in 2 pieces. The table top which looks nice and is light weight and the legs or frame which folds and looks nice too. Build construction is solid. Nothing is weak or wobbly. There were no clips to install. They were already installed. You literally fold out the frame and stick the top on it. Takes seconds and everything is sturdy. Great table in form function and looks. Made for a quick and easy set up in the midst of moving clutter. Will probably get another in a different color. Love this desk. Super easy to assemble and very sturdy. I received my desk and put it together (very easy). Once assembled, it wobbled...no way to adjust. Finally after re-screwing the table and playing with it...I sat down to feel it out. The surface isn't smooth, all the lines of the \"wood\" are textured, meaning you feel every bump. My elbows are marked from leaning on the desk, and if I write something on a paper, the table's texture will make it look like your 3 year old wrote it. ", "The desk is very sturdy and assembly was as easy as described - just snap top into place on the rails of the legs.  I like that I can roll up to it on my chair to do tasks that need more space than my desk provides.  It is very nice that I can very easily move this around the house for other tasks too.  The color was a little brown for what I anticipated, but pictures are so hard to capture that I'm not holding that against the seller.  They even warn of that in the listing and I could send it back if it really clashed with my existing desk.  I really want to give it 5 stars - but the top has SO many little flaws in the veneer.  There are tiny scratches and indentations that don't appear to be cause by damage - they appear to be flaws in the application of the veneer itself.  Almost like it was burned away in places or heated and warped.  I have a black felt mat on top of the area I would use for writing and such - so most of it is covered up and won't affect my writing surface, but it honestly looks like this was a reject and not 'first batch' quality.  For the price it could be expected, but with so many 5 star reviews, I guess it is a roll of the dice if you get a top quality or the guy sleeping on the job instead of checking veneer. This desk is awesome, it is perfect for the 'pandemic' work from home office. It was so easy to put together, literally unfold the frame and snap on the top. It is stable and the desktop looks high quality and feels nice. Well worth the price. My only gripe is it took 3 weeks to deliver, was 1 week past the estimated delivery time Amazon gave after purchase, so just be prepared. I get things are delayed right now and it did come from across the country, but goodness the wait to get a desk to work from home on was LONG! I am not knocking any stars off for shipping though, cause I hate when people do that... y'all want to know about the product, not the shipping, when you look at ratings, and this is definitely a 5 star desk in my book! I have my computer hooked to my 46 inch tv in my bedroom. Was using a lap board for keyboard and mouse use. We play games and use a full size gaming keyboard and gaming mouse. Larger lapboards are hard to find. This desk was perfect and the quality is very nice for the price. The desk is exactly the right size. Most were larger and would not fit well in the space I have. It would also be big enough for a laptop or keyboard and monitor. Very happy with this product. Highly recommend for smaller spaces. Firstly, this desk arrived well packed in perfect condition. It is constructed of three hinged panels which easily fold out to then allow you to simply securely snap on the desk top surface. The desk top is a beautiful and realistic textured wood finish which means the resulting desk looks and feels like you paid a lot more than what you did for it. I'm a tall guy and I find that I have ample leg room under this thing, not at all cramped, and it ends up being at perfect elbow resting height for me as well. The surface fits my 15.5\" macbook and my auxiliary 23\" acer monitor with room to spare. I use a clamp-on desk lamp to allow more surface work area and room for my mouse. I live in a coastal city so my square footage is at a premium, and I appreciate that I could fit an actual working computer station in to my space with this ideally sized and aesthetically pleasing desk. Wow, I can't say enough about this little desk! I have an 850 square foot house with 9x10 ft bedrooms and this desk was perfect for my space. The set up was ridiculously easy and was done in less than 5 minutes. The desktop seems like a heavy plastic or laminate and is solid. It looks almost like weathered wood and is textured, but still is smooth. I feel like it is going to be very durable. One of the best things I liked, as someone who has chemical sensitivities, is there was zero odor upon removing it from the box. Like I said in my title, do not hesitate to buy this desk! I was not paid or compensated in any way for my opinion, I bought this desk with my own money because I wanted to, And I'm so glad I did. Review for: Computer Desk Modern Study Desk Industrial Style Folding its a decent desk. it wont last forever but it serves its purpose. took longer to get it out of the box than to put it together. I wanted something cheap and temporary since I moved into an apartment and plan on getting a house soon and potentially getting a better desk by then, and boy did this hit what I needed. This actually is a table that I can see keeping in whatever house I move into. Easy to assemble, seems sturdy and fits in a small space well. Is able to hold my 32-inch monitor along with 15.6 inch laptop, along with smaller items like MAC keyboard and mouse. Easiest piece of furniture I have ever assembled. Literally took just 5 minutes to unbox and put together.  Since I've been working from home during this pandemic, I needed to find a small desk to accommodate a monitor, laptop, mousepad and desk stand with room for paperwork.  It doesn't take up much space, and has good leg room (I'm 5'5\").  I'm very happy with my purchase and the price I paid for it. ", "This is a wonderful desk. Perfect for small areas but still holds a presence. The design allows for the easiest assembly. Literally you take out of the box, unfold the frame, and pop the top on. It's very durable for the price and I'm an elbow leaner. This thing doesn't even move at the pressure of my elbows. So if you are looking for a good desk at an affordable price, this is the perfect desk for you. I like this table/desk. I wanted something I could use for projects and put it away if I needed to clean up. This will work. It is easy to assemble. The top pops off and then the bottom folds in so it will be easy to store or to move around the house as needed.  I'm thinking I could use it for parties as another serving station.  The only disappointment is it looks like it was returned and no one checked the desk's condition before sending it out to another customer. The box it came in was roughly taped up. The edges of the top piece are a little worn and there's a light scratch on the top but it's black so it's not horribly noticeable. The base of the desk is metal and those pieces look fine. It's just the top board. It bothers me but not enough to re-package it and transport it to a return location. Delivery took a little while (even with Prime) so that's another deterrent to returning it. This is why I gave it a 3 overall. The quality could be better. This is a great option for a desk in a small space. Obviously if you have a dedicated home office at your house, you're going to want a higher quality and larger desk (ideally with drawers). But if you want a place to work in a small nook of your apartment or home, then this desk is perfect. I love it! Looks good in person, and I was able to assemble it all by myself. The \u2018hardest\u2019 part was opening the box which was a little beat up but the desk doesn\u2019t show any wear from that. I use it in my office and I easily fold it up and carry it to the kitchen for meal prepping days. It folds up flat enough that I have little worry for when we move (being location independent we move a lot and long distances) Plus, it\u2019s cat and dog approved. My cat nests next to me on it, I have a bowl of grapes on the opposite side of my laptop, my 46lb dog naps under it, and I\u2019m not pushed aside by either of them! :D Everyone wins! The desk looks nice and is very small which is what I needed, but the center of it bends significantly with even the weight of your hands.  This is not a desk for a computer monitor.  I recommend that the seller reinforces the middle of the desk with an additional metal bar. I bought this for my daughter in college.  She needed space to set up a sound board, microphone, laptop, etc, etc,etc.  She didn't care what it looked like, I did. ;-)  As soon as I saw this one, I knew it was the one.  It's very stylish and minimalistic at the same time.  She has plenty of room for everything she needs, the microphone was easily able to attach to the edge of this and there's even room underneath for some nice storage drawers to keep her smaller items. This desk seems to be well made and uses sturdy materials. I have not felt as if anything was too heavy for it. It is not a huge desk, but there is plenty of room on top for a computer and a bit of a workstation. It has plenty of leg room, however the bars at the back which provide support do limit the space a bit. Sitting normally you probably won't have any problems, but if you like to recline you may have to work to find a solution. Some sort of semi-firm memory foam pillow would probably work to turn the bar itself into a foot rest. The desk stands at about 3 feet tall; I am 5'4\" and use a gaming chair at the lowest setting (a little over 2 feet tall) which puts the computer screen almost exactly at eye level meaning that I do not have to strain my neck. This desk is so easy to set up.  I am not kidding, it was the easiest set up of any furniture I've ever had.  It makes me want to throw away every piece of Ikea furniture I ever shed a tear for.  The desk once set up is perfectly sturdy and looks much more expensive than it is.  I have a small amount of space in my classroom for a desk, and this is the perfect size.  I love that I can easily fold it up and put it out of the way if my students need more space.  Don't hesitate, this is the desk for you. We are so satisfied with this desk! It is the perfect size for what we needed. Fits a laptop, a 24\u201d monitor, and a mouse + keyboard comfortably. The feel of the desk itself is smooth and soft, my mouse works without a mousepad. Assembly was literally 2 minutes, so easy yet it is sturdy and secure. Only \u2018con\u2019 I could list is leg room. I have long legs already, but I can\u2019t stretch them completely under the desk (ours is against a wall), but I can stretch them out through the side and there\u2019s a bit of a foot rest there. I have zero complaints and love, love, love this desk. Bought this because it was affordable.  Didn't have high hopes from some of the reviews and pictures but I'm super stoked on my purchase.  It's a really sturdy desk and the finish is nice for being a laminate.  Can't really even tell where the seams are.  The metal was a bit misshapen upon arrival but my boyfriend banged it out with a mallet or something.  Good as new.  Easy to color match other furniture with, also super easy to assemble and disassemble.  I use a large yoga ball as my chair and it's a perfect height match. ", "Initially I was very impressed with the desk parts as removed from the carton.. Upon examining the whole thing, I notice the left side was 1/2 lower than the rest of the desk framework. Looking at the hinge, it became obvious that the assembly was off as that left assembly as it was attached to the main back frame of the desk.... I had to re-align and redrill the holes that the left assembly attach too. Flat Furniture used to be a great way to save money because the assembly was upto the customer... but when something thats parts total $20 arrives and requires more than minor adjustments.. $59 was robbery. Quality control must have not been introduced in the factory either..... Very easy to setup, but the top is bowed as mentioned in other reviews. The middle of the top sags down about 1/4-3/8 inch in the middle, it's like it can't support it's own weight. The textured top looks nice but does make it difficult to write on due to the ridges in the fake woodgrain surface. I've been using this desk for several months now and I can say that I've never had any problems with it. It took a whopping minute or two to set up and it's relatively sturdy. I wanted a smaller desk (my other one was massive and took up most of my room) for writing/schoolwork. I use my laptop, and I'd imagine a desktop computer might be a bit cramped on this surface, but it's perfect for my laptop. For my needs, this is 10 stars. Very simple installation, no tools needed. Only two parts the top and the metal base. The base open and closed like a door.  More than expected. The top look like fake wood but very real looking design. We love it. Truly happy. This little desk saved me during COVID19. I\u2019ve been working in my kitchen for 2 months and couldn\u2019t take the distractions and setting up and putting away my work station every day. I tucked this against the wall in my bedroom and moved my bed over a bit. We love the study desk. No screws for set up; we just pulled it out of the box, folded it open and clicked the table into place. It's plenty big for a desktop, monitor, keyboard and mouse but still has the small dimensions to not take up too much space. I could see how maybe others have had a problem with the plastic covering of the wood plank peeling off or coming damaged but ours was fine and has a nice look. I assume its particle board underneath. Overall very satisfied! In all my years of purchasing items on Amazon, this has been BY FAR the best purchase I have ever made. I was nervous about ordering a desk online simply because you can almost NEVER match quality with cheap prices and behold this purchase has proven that statement to be untrue! I prepared myself to take 2 hours + to assemble the desk. I ate dinner, cleaned the kitchen and begin to unbox at 8:15p. It is now 8:28 and I am writing the review. Literally I unboxed the bottom half, and snapped the top on! I probably spent about 10 min looking for directions and the other 2 logging on to Amazon to write a product review. Literally took 60 seconds to put it together! It feels and looks like good quality. I will update after a few months of using! I am a teacher, and currently in school to receive another degree, this desk will get plenty wear and tear! Lets see how it goes! overly satisfied this far! :) I just received this desk today. It probably took me less than 5 minutes to get it out of the box and put it together! You literally just have to \u201csnap\u201d on the table top portion. It\u2019s a simple design and lightweight. I love it!  I was skeptical that it would look cheap, but it looks very nice! Also, you can\u2019t beat the price if you are in need of a desk! Very happy with this purchase. Perfect for my studio apartment office space. It is smaller. Comfortably fits my laptop, two plush animals, pens, notepads, and my easel. Plenty of room underneath for extra storage for rubbermaid dressers and organizers. Im about 6 ft and my legs fit under it. My friends cant believe it took zero tools to do. Its sleek and modern looking. Make sure you apply pressure when applying the base. I made the mistake of not \"snapping\" in into place at first. I am not mechanically inclined and this was an absolute breeze! I cant wait to purchase more of their no tool items. I love when a purchase is even better than I'd hoped. I was looking for a desk that didn't weigh too much because I needed to drag it up one flight of stairs to my apartment. I also wanted something that was easy to put together. And, finally, I wanted something that looked good and felt sturdy. This met all of that. I like this desk a lot and will probably buy more items from this company. ", "Edit:After a month, the desk top is in U shape. Completely garbage now. DO NOT BUY!!! Once I started to work from home full time during the SIP, I needed a desk to fit in my small apartment. This desk does the job - small, lightweight, easy to assemble. Now that I have been using it for 2+ months, I feel like It could've been deeper since I have a 34 inch monitor and using a laptop in front of it (to type). I have scooted my monitor to hang 2 inches off of the back and using the wall to help hold the monitor up and in place. This desk would be PERFECT if it was a little deeper, but overall, it's an awesome desk. I can not get over how awesome this desk is!!!!!!  Seriously comes unfolded and took me 5 minutes to unbox, carry upstairs, and set up the desk in my office.  I'm smaller (5ft2 130) and had zero issues picking it up, carrying, maneuvering my steps, etc.  Going to replace the desk in our family room with this bad boy.  Desk is sleek and gorgeous.  It's faux wood but the wood looks real.  It doesn't feel like wood but does have some texture to it  Reminds me of engineered hardwood flooring texture with the feel.  I still use a coaster with  my water bottle in case of a spill or water mark left.  I have 2 22 inch monitors, keyboard, mouse, phone, and file organizer and still have plenty of room to write and have papers sprawled across the desk.  I'm in the process of getting a 2nd one for the downstairs.  If you're on the fence with this one, just purchase it already! I just had this desk delivered today and so far I love it. I'm writing this review from laptop that's on the this desk. The assembly literally could not be easier - don't waste your money on Amazon's \"expert assembly\"! I had the box the desk came in on the floor of my living room at 1:55pm. At 1:58pm I was pushing the assembled desk into the bedroom it's going in. It literally takes long to open up the box and remove the pieces than it is to assemble! Just received it and put together in no time at all. It's been a real relief after not having a proper desk to work on for so long. Very glad that it's just the right size for my space, but what's even more important is that it's not too small, looks nice, and holds my 17.3 laptop well enough. I do get a bit of vibration when typing but suppose that's because I've always been a bit heavy-handed on the keyboard. The base is metal and the top snaps right into place. Had to make sure to push firmly so that the top went in flush. The top is MDF, not wood, so I wouldn't want to crowd the desk, let it stay damp for a long time, or weigh it down with heavier equipment. This is a simple, minimalist work desk. Assembly takes two steps. With a bit of extra space, I can easily fit a laptop, textbook, and a lamp on the desk. If you need to do any writing, be sure you are not doing so on a single sheet of paper resting on the desk. The desk has imitation-wood grooves and is not smooth like a typical desk. I do wish that there would be some sort of metal beam underneath the middle of the desk as it is only supported on the sides. This brings into question if the desk will eventually droop in the middle because of the lack of support. In that case, I don't recommend stacking textbook upon textbook on this desk. t is approximately 3\u2019 2.5\u201d  in length, 1\u2019 7.5\u201d in width, and 2\u2019 4.5\u201d in height. This desk sets up in 90 seconds, which is great. It is exactly what I need. I like to write in my living room, looking out toward the back yard. I'm a guy who has to have natural light. With this desk, I can work on my writing with my laptop and then move the whole outfit if we need to entertain or whatever. I actually have two laptops and an iPad open on the desk at the same time. The construction is surprisingly solid. I may buy a couple more to use for projects and other activities. I love this desk. I actually bought three of them to make a full lenght desk across a wall in my computer room. It looks great and makes for a nice computer/office style area. The wooden look matches my house well. and couldn't be more easy to assemble. just open it up and pop it together. Don't even need instructions its as easy as looking at it to see how it goes together. Price isn't too bad either although seems like bing plastic and not wood for the top it could be a little cheaper. But it's well made for being from china and has the nice metal black legs. A nice sturdy and secure table that holds my HP 7720 wide format printer (34 Lbs.) plus a few other things. Easy to assemble, no tools required. There's four clips that snap into place and securely hold the top onto the legs/frame. The only problem was that one of the clips was broken when I received the table, but I suppose it's no big deal and it'd be more trouble than it's worth to return the table for a new one. I just put the broken clip side to the backside of the table and the weight of the printer firmly holds the top in place. My package was sort of crushed when I received it and I'm thinking that it broke while in transit so I'm not going to blame the table manufacturer. I have been working from home more now due to COVID.  I will have to go back into the office full time eventually so it didn't make sense for me to set up a \"permanent\" office in the spare bedroom.  This works perfect because I can put it away when I need to.  I feel like I will be using it for other things as well though!  Perfect for a laptop, an extra monitor, wireless keyboard, etc.  I would even fit a second larger monitor if I wanted to. ", "I have purchased 3 of these for various uses around the house. Starting with the assembly - which consists of opening box, unfolding stand, and clipping top to the stand - 2 minutes, to the price and value, I think this is a great little desk. To be sure, the desk top is thin - you don't want to have anything heavy on this, especially in the center (like a heavy old school monitor or something) as the top will sag in the center. The top is also particle board covered with a nice plastic print of wood - so don't expect heirloom quality or anything, but it seems pretty tough. Of the 3 I have purchased, 2 have had imperfections along one of the short edges of the desk top, but were hidden when snapped to the base, so not a big deal. The whole thing assembled is pretty lightweight and easy to move. I'm using one as a extra desk, another as a nightstand/desk in the bedroom, and a 3rd to hold hobby gear.  Hope that helps you! This was perfect for my little office area. The fact that it collapses was a huge plus too. It seems to be sturdy enough to hold a ton of books I put on it and it has enough room for studying. The style is nicely modern and it looks great and stylish too. I was afraid that it would look cheap and it absolutely did not. For the price, this is an unbeatable item. Extremely easy to assemble! The top just folds down and clicks into the legs. It can\u2019t get any easier! The frame is made out of sturdy metal and the top is a durable plastic with a faux wood finish. It fits perfectly in my bedroom where I use it to work from home. I usually have a laptop, mouse, a little plant, and some papers on the desk and everything fits fine. If you\u2019re super messy and need to spread out a ton of papers all over the place, I would recommend a larger desk, but if you have somewhere else to store all the mess and only need the desk for a couple of items, it should work fine. One thing to be aware of - Once I put a hot bowl of soup on the desk and it slightly melted the finish, so watch out for that. Other than that, this desk has worked perfectly for me, and I searched Amazon hard to find the best desk they had for the cheapest price! I highly recommend this item! We use this desk at our weekend market business.  It is easy to transport, set up and looks great!  The one issue I have with it is that one of the four quick release attachments for the legs came off of the desk.  Though it is still usable, it is not quite as sturdy.  Having said that, the thing broke because we remove it from and store it back in its original box weekly.  We do this because we transport it weekly to our market.  Having said that, the screws that hold the (I don't what you call the receiver for the frame) in place were too shallow, barely going into the desk.  I should be able to fix this break pretty easily.  For the money, it's a great value.  If you travel with it, be careful that you don't shear one of the receivers off. I was planning to buy a card table to set up my temporary home office, so I was resigned to having an eyesore in my front room until the end of the pandemic.  Then I saw this folding desk and figured I\u2019d give it a try.  After all, it couldn\u2019t be worse than a card table.  It actually looks very cute! It\u2019s small enough to fit in my tiny corner, but big enough for a couple small monitors.  The top is laminate, but it looks fine - not cheap and ugly as I\u2019d feared.  I chose Slippy Vintage Brown.  The desk comes fully assembled, except for simply snapping the top on.  No tools needed.  I also ordered a cable hider box and screwed it onto the bottom of the desk to hide all my cords. I think the desk looks great and I highly recommend it! I really wanted a folding table for my laptop, two monitors, and a keyboard. This table was the perfect size. Just wide enough and just the right length. It looks good, is light, is easy to assemble, and easy to disassemble. I found it too tall for comfortable keyboard height, though. That was fine. I bought a hanging keyboard tray and secured it to the edge of the table. I made the right choice with this table! I purchased this item because I needed a desk I could set up in a quiet space when I work at home, but also store when I am not using it.  I also wanted something that fit the room d\u00e9cor and didn't look cheap, but that I didn't spend a lot of money on.  This desk checks all the boxes.  The desk arrived in perfect condition.  It was super easy to set up (takes less than a minute).  It took more time to get it out of the box than to set up!  It will fit easily under the bed or in a closet when not in use.  The desk also looks nice and fits in with the living room furniture downstairs.  The reason for 4 stars is the board bows slightly in the middle when there is weight on it (i.e. leaning your elbows on the desk).  This isn't a huge deal breaker since my laptop is light and I'm not leaning on the desk much.  My concern is the board will permanently bow over time.  That said, this desk was like $60 and the board is made out of pressed particles.  I mean, you get what you pay for.  The board is also textured, so you need to use a pad for your mouse or for writing.  Not a big deal.  I also wish there was just about 4 more inches of depth on this desk for leg room, and so I can use my monitor stand for my second screen.  Again, not a deal breaker, and I knew the dimensions going in.  Overall, desk is pretty decent for the price, look, and functionality. Table was alright quality. For me, the table was uneven - rocking back and forth when working and there was a gouged out dent underneath the table which sort of bothers me considering that it\u2019s deep enough to expose the wood underneath the coatings. This would be great used on carpet flooring but I can\u2019t guarantee it on even surfaces. I almost didn\u2019t order this because the bad reviews were really bad. However the percentage of 4 & 5 star reviews outweighed them significantly. I glad I listened to reason. I looked at several options some were cheaper, but when I noticed that this one had the top that snaps in rather than me needing to use any screws it was my choice. Very easy to take out of the box open it up and snap the top in place. I like the rustic look of the wood surface however If you want something very smooth you might want to put a pad down to write on. However writing  on normal paper I didn\u2019t seem to have problems.It fit between my closet and the window. I am 5\u201911\u201d and feel like there\u2019s plenty of leg room. As you can see in the picture it was big enough for my laptop, extra monitor,keyboard and mouse.  I feel as though it\u2019s very sturdy catch but I don\u2019t know what the weight limit is. ", "I purchased this desk for my son who has limited space in his room.  He loves it.  he stores it under his bed when not in use and when he needs it he pulls it out and sets in up in 2 minutes.  And we also really like the look of it.  Perfect for anyone that doesn't want a desk set up all the time. The best aspect of this product was that it was incredibly easy to assemble, as advertised. I in fact was surprised by how easy it was. It looks nice, nothing too fancy but for the pricepoint and what I needed it for it's been great. It is sturdy, but you have to understand that it folds and locks into place and is very efficiently made, so there are no extras. It is more focused on function but the black metal legs and wooden-looking top of the desk look nice. It provided me with what I needed a quick solution to needing a home office desk that was easy to assemble and priced nicely. For the price I was impressed This desk is great. I've had it about 2 months now and so far, so good. It came quickly and arrived fully intact and looks really good. Super easy to put together. I had also read all of the reviews beforehand and saw the comments about the sagging in the middle over time, as well as another person's solution to prevent it. So, immediately after setting my desk up, I placed some styrofoam between the gap in the back frame and the tabletop to prevent the dip from occurring. I haven't had any issues and that little trick made the top sturdier. I'd definitely recommend anyone who buys the desk do the same thing. Overall, i love it. Compact, easy set-up, looks good, and decent sized desktop for good workspace, and nothing obstructs the legroom. Wow! I read so many reviews. I was super skeptical but I absolutely love it! I\u2019m working from home for a few more months due to COVID 19 so I needed a better set up. This desk is absolutely perfect! Great height. Extremely easy assembly. Sturdy, durable, and can\u2019t beat being able to fold up and store when not needed. I can not recommend this desk enough! I\u2019ve suggested it to so many people already. I\u2019m very impressed with this desk. I used to work from home one day a week but now I am home way more so I needed a bigger desk that was just mine. I also wanted the option to easily store the desk later if my situation changes. This desk is perfect! It fits beautifully in a small corner of my room, but is big enough for my laptop, ergonomic keyboard, mouse, monitor, and papers. The setup was literally a snap - you take the legs and then snap the desktop into place. If I need to store this desk, it will fit nicely folded up and take up almost no space. The desktop is faux wood but looks pretty. It arrived earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise. It was SUPER easy to assemble. Just unfold the legs and click on the top of the desk. The desk together is heavier than I thought which is a good thing since it makes it sturdy and not flimsy. The metal legs don't look cheap and the \"wood\" part looks really beautiful. This desk blew me away with it's great quality considering the affordable price. It seems like I'm not the only one who has had this problem based on other reviews I saw.  As I was purchasing, I was betting on not receiving one from the defective batch, but luck was not on my side.  How am I supposed to use the desk if it flexes downwards even when a light-weight laptop is placed on top? I'll start with the good and move to the bad. The fake wood wrap is already coming off right out of the box. My particular wood piece does not align perfectly. Says in the instructions to email them but does not leave an email and their website is no where to be found. Also lowered the price to $60 right after I got it, not sorry for being salty. Perfect for impromptu work-from-home set-up. It took me longer to unbox this thing than to actually set it up. No tools required for assembly. Easiest thing I've ever \"put together\" (the top is the only part that needs attaching, and it just snaps onto the pre-assembled, fold-out legs/base). My only complaint is that this has risen in price by $25 in the last 10 days. Not a complaint about the desk at all (hence still 5 stars), but it's still a bummer considering a lot of people are finding themselves in need of a desk for small spaces in a pinch. Regardless, this desk is fantastic and I still highly recommend it. ", "This a great desk for small spaces. Easy to assemble as you do not require any tools. You just need to stand up the legs of the table and drop wooden plank on the hinges and secure it in place. This is a nice desk but falls short of being perfect due to it not being very sturdy and the plan bends when applied pressure or higher weight on it. So be selective with what you place on the table. I needed a small desk as I live in a two-bedroom condo. I wanted something I would be able to stowaway. This is perfect! I am currently working part-time at the office and then my home. I had taken over my kitchen table and had to eat in the living room. Since purchasing this desk, I have it in front of my sliding glass door to my balcony and can work with a view. I also write, so this will make this process more comfortable as well. I highly recommend this desk if you require a stowaway desk. I did not want one of those cheap plastic white desks. The desk is stylish and fits in with my decor beautifully. None Good small table fits my thunderbolt monitor and MacBook Pro with its stand. I also fit my Apple keyboard and mouse. I've been working from home for 4 months, and I don't know if I will be able to go back to the office anytime soon. I finally broke down and decided to get a desk for my 600 square foot apartment. I couldn't be happier with this purchase! Absolutely worth the money. I was shocked at how light it is, so if you have back problems, this will not be a bother for you! (Granted it is very light, it is also still very sturdy.) I hate leaving anything work related out over the weekend, so I just pop the top off of the desk, fold the sides in, and throw it in the closet! So easy to assemble, unassemble, move and store. I'd been making do with a bunch of small nesting tables in front of my sofa, and decided to order this table after seeing great reviews on another site (Apartment Therapy, maybe?). Anyway - best money I've spent on a piece of furniture in a long time. It's sturdy, has good legroom (a little on the tall side, which I like), but isn't so bulky that it visually clutters up the room. Mostly I use it for an all purpose sofa table, but when someone comes over to co-work with me I can quickly change it to a desk. And all my nesting tables fit under it! so that's a bonus. Great purchase. So far so good. I bough two of them to prepare an area for the online Back to School of my two girls. The desk is very easy to assemble. The size is perfect, not too big not too small. Shipping was not as fast as I am used for Amazon items; but it was not late and within the provided window for arrival (the usual after the Covid started). I love that the desk it is so easy to assemble/ disassemble and move. It makes it very portable and I believe I will need the portability to adapt to the new virtual school format. I originally bought this as a desk to temp work at home. However, ended up working at home perm and my husband bought me an actual sit/stand. When this arrived I was planning on returning it, however, this little desk is amazing. It's super easy to store and if you need any extra room for whatever. , It's really pretty as the wood top looks real and is a good neutral brown color (not red or gray). I used this at the end of my kitchen island for puzzles and extra entraining space. No way would I return this!! Kinda want another one.... This is just what I needed and was looking for. I was getting overwhelmed with the amount of options online but decided to give this one a try based on the look, color, and price. I bought 3 of these for my home office. These desks are not extremely sturdy but they do the job that I need them to. Very easy to assemble, all I had to do was put the top surface on to the legs/standing part of the desk. No tools needed. ", "It\u2019s a delight to have in my room!! For the price it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m 6ft tall and I can sit perfectly in it with room for my dog to sleep under while I study the Bible! I bought this item, a few months back and it is a legitimate and reliable product with a fair price. However, there are a few things which I want to highlight: I purchased this desk a year ago and have overall really enjoyed it. It's minimalist in style, which I love, and the assembly was as easy as pulling out the iron legs and placing the actual desk in position. Great for small rooms! Which was why I bought it. The material is a kind of MDF particle board, the the finish on top looks gorgeous and would trick someone into thinking it could be real wood if viewed from a distance. When I do upgrade to a metal or wood desk one day, I'll likely still keep this around as an end table because it really is rather cute. I assembled this in about 30 seconds. It is so cute, incredibly sturdy, and fits perfectly in the corner of my small apartment. I paired it with a pretty accent chair. I love my little workspace now! A great purchase! I received this table quickly and w/o any damage.  It really is very versatile table.  Solid table when fully assembled especially on a carpeted surface.  Very easy to assemble.... no brainer here. \"Open and pop on the table top. Boom! Your done that quick.  If you really need the instructions, they are available and they're readable and easy to follow.  The best part is that when I need the space back, I can break it down in nothing flat, and store it off to the side or wherever.  Great little table for whatever I want it for. This desk is AWESOME!  I don't usually take the time to post pics and write reviews because I am so excited to get my \"new stuff\".  My teens slid it into the garage until I got home.  Cut box open,  took out frame, put in room, took out top, snapped it on.  Boom!  Done!  I took pics so you can see how much stuff fits on the desk.  I opened my Canon wireless printer so you can also see the slide out part for the paper fits too.  My chair fit and 2 sterilite weave drawers stacked on top.  I use it for extra shipping/office supplies.  Even tho there is no drawer, baskets/tubs/storage can go underneath so you still have room for your chair.  I looked at several desks on here that were over $150 bucks.....no need for it, this one is looks the same but costs less.  Excellent purchase for sure! This is a really cute, small desk great for when you have limited space. I like the industrial feel of the mixed wood/metal, and it was ridiculously easy to put together. If you\u2019re looking for something portable, get this! Firstly, this desk took 3 weeks to get delivered, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have any kind of time constraints. Overall, I liked the desk when it arrived. I have bought two bookshelves previously from the same company, and really like the no assembly products. However, I noticed that in only a few days, the covering of the fake wood top starting to peel on the sides. I have been extremely careful with the desk, and this is very disappointing. If the aesthetic appeal of the desk is ruined, it really isn't worth anything. ", "I know, I know....the top is rough? Really? That's what we are sad about in 2020? I'm not really sad, I just spend a lot of time at this desk working from home and I put my arms on the table like my mom told me not to do so I just wish it was a smooth top instead of textured. That's all. Attractive, Affordable band EASY Assembly!!! The good thing about this price.  The height however is to high for me and being male I am taller than average females.  So problem with desk is height at least one or two inches to high  for computer desk.  My wrist especially on mouse side should be lower or even with my three office chairs none however even with full height, I can not get my arm to go above the desk height.  So I have to buy office chairs with arms that extend as well but shouldn't have to make strange settings.  So, I classify  this is either a writing desk 2 inch to high or short term usage.  If you use for few hrs no good. Next desk I will make sure lower. This is a very high quality desk.  I like the fact that it can easily be folded and stowed away.  It's sturdy as well.  My only complaint is the brace that's behind the desk made it difficult for me to mount a clamp base for my LCD screen. This is a great space-saving table.  It got here on time and was in excellent condition.  I needed more storage space and easier accessibility for frequently used items in my kitchen and this table was the perfect choice.  It is also very sturdy. An added benefit is that it can be folded up. Typically the space it occupies has a square table for the time between Thanksgiving and new years for food and prep for the holidays. Now I won't have to find somewhere to store it during the holidays. I would buy another one should the need arise. It is small and simple to put together. My only complaint is that it is a little flimsy. I like that is it foldable, it's a nice feature of the desk. My son loves the desk. If you\u2019re using it as a computer desk, know that you\u2019ll need a mouse pad, the surface does have a grain. It\u2019s not the sturdiest of desks. It\u2019ll hold a decent amount of weight so long it\u2019s evenly distributed. Don\u2019t count on putting a computer tower on top of the side of the desk. The desk isn\u2019t quite wide enough and the weight so far on one side makes the desk unstable enough to not take the chance. Tower goes on the floor. I am a taller man and can easily fit into this desk. It also is extremely easy to put together and store. The ability to simply remove the top and fold in the legs creates an opportunity for me to easily move and store this desk when I need the space, making it perfect for dorms or smaller apartments. The only downside is that the top board doesn't have much support in the middle so excessive leaning when reading or writing puts a bend on the top. Despite that I love it and use it frequently for my studying and writing. This desk is sturdy and easy to set up without help. I use it in my relatively small, dorm-like room at home (recent college grad living with parents) and it's strong enough to handle my computer, some books, and my drawing pad. I'm not sure if it would be great to handle a hard drive or anything that substantial over a long span of time, but it's pretty great for basic needs. It's also aesthetically beautiful with a modern sort of look. The surface of the desk isn't fantastic for writing on directly, because it's a little textured, but the texture also prevents anything from easily sliding off, so I don't mind it. Pretty sturdy, and it took me like 5 seconds to put together. Literally like legos. I was suprised some people had difficulties. Anyway. After installing the 5 second desk, i put all my stuff on it. Its pretty small for my full tower pc. So the computer takes up all the space. The picture kinda makes it look big before you buy it. Oh and yeah dont try to write on it haha i wish there was an underframe with bars to install across under the wood slab. But hey, it was 60$. I still honestly believe its only worth $20, but it works and its pretty good. Only I have to return it now cause my foot hammock doesn't work well with the bars that go across the back. Make sure you want it before you buy it. Seller will make you pay return shipping. ", "Only one issue with this table, the textured surface wrap is a bit loose around the edges, and you can feel it. Not sure what sort of material the desk top is made out of. But any weight of your arms on it and it bows slightly. As I am using this for working from home in a pinch because of the great pandemic of 2020, I needed something easy and quick to get myself off the kitchen table and to my own space to work. It shipped fast, assembled REALLY fast and simple which is a plus. It will easily fit in a closet when not in use which is where it will be until another work at home situation. I had no idea this was going to become my home office desk. It was supposed to be just a little work space for kids and adults. It's a great little desk and has been a huge help in what became a very sudden home office situation. Extremely easy to set up: you unfold it and snap the top on. The end. I recently moved to a different state but only plan to be here temporarily so I didn\u2019t bring any furniture. I needed a cheap desk to use for a gaming computer that didn\u2019t take up much space. I wasn\u2019t expecting much since this was so inexpensive but it\u2019s actually pretty great! Took a minute to set-up and seems very sturdy. It also looks pretty nice. It\u2019s obviously not a fancy piece of furniture but it doesn\u2019t look cheap or tacky at all. I\u2019m very pleased! If you need an easy, low cost desk, I don\u2019t think it gets any better than this! Would definitely repurchase if I ever need another Perfect for small space in sons room. Has a farm house vintage look which is great. Good price.. folds away easy and is light. Can be stored under bed easily to be out of the way if needed. Son uses it for gaming, puts a  large light up mouse pad on top of it.. and  uses it to game with for Xbox. Uses tv as his monitor. Lots of room on desk with mousepad and keyboard. Large chair fits nicely with desk. Son is very comfortable now when he games on Xbox. Does not need to stand for hours in front of tv now. Too small for my expectations. I thought it was bigger and wider but it\u2019s just a very small compact desk that would be perfect for a studio or college students. I pretty much can\u2019t fit my paperworks, documents, and other items that I planned to put on this desk. So, I tried to see how much it can actually fit, and I put my usb port, desk lamp, keyboard and a mouse - this seems to be pretty much all that can fit on this little table. This is perfect for my room!! It fits in my space perfectly and was really easi to unfold and click the top into place. It's lightweight yet sturdy for my workspace. The top is texturized so the only downside is you can't write directly on it.. you have to out a smooth surface under your paper. I love it though! I got this desk before COVID-19 thus prior to full-time remote working but boy am I glad I did! Although I never expected to spend 8-10 hours a day at this desk when I purchased it, it has been a life saver.  I have a large monitor and laptop on a stand on it and I still have plenty of room for my wireless keyboard and mouse.  The desk isn't super wide/deep so if you need to keep files or work with paper, it may be too small for that.  But for a fully electronic job, it's superb. It fits nicely in my guest room, was easy to assemble, and can fold down/tuck away easily if needed. I highly recommend this desk! This was probably the easiest furniture to setup ever, it legitimately took longer to pull it out of the box than it did to set it up.  There fold up feature is really nice for small spaces.  I'm eating it 4 stars instead of 5 because it says it can hold 200 lbs, and mine is bowing slightly with under 20 lbs on it.  It's a great desk for a normal setup, just don't expect to put 200 lbs on it if you're basing your purchase on that I love this desk. My bedroom is where my office area is and there isn't a ton of room. I used to have a big and bulky office desk but got rid of it to free up space, but I found myself having to work from home more and more. What I love about this desk is that is has plenty of surface area to work on it - I am usually working with blueprints and my laptop at the same time on it - then when I am done, I pop the top off, fold it back up and lean it against the wall. It could easily slide under a bed, between your bed and dresser, or in a closet and is light weight enough to move it about the house when and where it is needed. When it is folded up and leaned against my wall, it is about 6 inches wide or so, giving me the room I need to do whatever. ", "The desk to start with is easy to assemble but below are my issues and I had to return the same. While it took nearly a month to arrive and I had to adjust major presentations due to covid-19, the desk is as advertised.  It is perfect for a small home office and can be put together in mere minutes.  Most of time is unpacking from the box.  Good product and would recommend to college students getting a small apartment or dorm setting. Due to COVID-19 keeping me from returning to work, I have decided to invest in a desk space. I didn\u2019t want anything large or expensive, something easy to set up and store away, while still looking luxurious. I found this desk and after reading the positive reviews and measurement details, I decided to purchase without hesitation. I am SO glad that I did, because this desk is absolutely perfect. It takes seconds to set up, is very sturdy and looks perfect for the minimal space that I have. I was so thrilled with this desk that I had to tell all of my other coworkers to get one too. The material is top notch and this desk has been a lifesaver while I am working from home. I highly recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive at-home office desk during these unprecedented times. You will not regret it! When I got the desk the screw part was already assembled in a slightly wrong place and caused the problem that one of the side won't go in. Also there was a little scratch on the surface. I considered returning but the service person was very nice and patient and helped me reinstall the desk through email. So now it works. Now after too much effort to fix the table it is a little bit shaky on one side when I move it but it's perfectly fine to do work on. I also really like the design of this desk. First, let me say, I really like the simplicity and look of this desk. I have a very small space to work with for my home office and this fits nicely. I also have the 4 tier folding bookshelf from the same company and it's fantastic. This desk was also insanely easy to assemble. So those are the pluses. I looked for a desk for months- needed something that wasn\u2019t big and bulky but also cool. I bought this based on reviews and pics of different configurations you can do with adding another price to it. I love how you can create and L , U shape workspace if you choose to. I also love that the desks can be used in other areas of the home as well. This was super easy to assemble and light weight. I\u2019ll be purchasing another to create a L shaped work space do I can really spread out my paperwork etc. This was a great price too . If you hate those bulky , cheap looking desk systems that take up a whole wall then you will love this. This thing comes with only 2 components.... The metal frame (already connected via hinges) and the desk top (solid fake wood). I looked in the box for tools or parts... Nothing else. Hmmm. The top snapped right into place. Easiest desk setup I've ever experienced. It's slightly small for a laptop and second monitor but I'm going to mount the montior to free up some space. Killer desk! Exactly what I needed!  Small enough to fit in corner of my living room for my \u201coffice\u201d space but big enough for my laptop, extra monitor, keyboard,mouse, and coffee cup.  It looks nice, it\u2019s super easy to put together and I like that I can fold it up if I don\u2019t need it long term. I bought this desk to hold a desktop computer and a 27\" monitor. It's just the right size. Even though it's not the type of desk that will someday become a family heirloom, it looks nice. Nonetheless, my favorite aspect of this desk is how easy it is to assemble. It comes in two pieces, and it just snaps together, which took me about one minute. There are no screws or other small parts to deal with. The most difficult part of the whole assembly was opening and disposing of the box it came in. I'm thinking of ordering another one to hold a printer. It's the perfect size for one. I needed a small table that was long enough to hold my computer, papers, a few books, and a snack but not too wide since the room in which I wanted to place it is small. Plus I hate assembling furniture, but this required merely unfolding the legs and clicking on the top.  Took less than a minute.  Sturdy enough that it holds what I want and doesn't wobble or stand uneven.  I may purchase another one to place in front of some floor to ceiling windows to hold plants.  I highly recommend. ", "Let me say that this was a piece of cake to assemble and packaged well. Most of the installation time was just getting it out of the box where it was tightly packed with foam. If you receive one that is chipped or anything I assume it was sent that way. I received mine in great condition and literally all you do is unfold the legs and snap the desk top into place over the top of the legs, takes 30 seconds. It looks great and seems well worth the money. I am 6'2 and was worried about leg room but I have plenty. I keep it tucked into a small space in my apartment bedroom and holds my 32 inch monitor, keyboard, mouse, laptop, headphone stand, and an audio receiver for my guitar all neatly and comfortably. Very impressed with this purchase and would highly reccomend it to anyone wanting a desk that wont take up much room, has just the right amount of desk space, plenty of legroom, and is easy to transport (especially for those of us who are renters and move more often). I've been working from home since March and needed a desk urgently. This is a really nice simple looking desk, it's definitely smaller than what I'd hope since I need enough space for my two monitors an Ipad, keyboard, mouse plus my notepad and notes. I find myself struggling for enough writing space. It's also not as sturdy as I would've hoped. I can't really lean on the middle section as it caves in a little bit. Overall a wobbly, thin, simple desk. This table really is badly designed and I\u2019m not happy at all. I only have my laptop and a lamp on it and yet with every touch on the keyboard, the table shakes. It\u2019s very annoying. I wish I could return it but I\u2019ve tossed away the box. This desk takes longer to unpack than it does to assemble. You just swing the legs open and pop your wood top in. I work from home a lot and I purchased this desk to supplement the desk space in my home office. I love the fact that it's so easy to fold up and store if I don't need it. I can also choose to easily move it to another room if I need it for another purpose. It seems sturdy enough for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you have limited space or need the flexibility to move this desk around. Liked that there was basically no assembly needed. All you need to do is inbox, unfold and snap the top on- when I don\u2019t know need it I just fold it up. I like this desk because it is easy to assemble by yourself, it is simple/aesthetically pleasing, and it\u2019s big enough to fit a laptop and several other miscellaneous items while still being small enough to fit well into a small room. I\u2019ve had this desk for about 2 weeks, and it seems sturdy/durable enough. The only reason why I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because the wood really doesn\u2019t seem that great of a quality. This was the easiest desk I\u2019ve ever assembled. Comes in two pieces: the top wood piece and the metal frame/legs (which are foldable). No screws required since it just snaps together. If you\u2019re looking for something small and simple and affordable, this is a pretty good choice. I think it took longer to get out of the box than to put together. I love this table for my office at work so much. I needed additional surface for my tonnes of paperwork. Easy to set up, contemporary and rustic at the same time. Well made, sturdy, price so reasonable that my boss is willing to pay for it. I would buy another one for my apartment and recommend this fantastic table to colleagues and friends. Thank you seller and amazon! I saw the same or similar table from other sellers but they\u2019re more expensive. So I highly recommend that you buy from this seller! I really love this desk for many reasons. It's super easy to assemble and fits nicely in a room that doesn't offer lots of extra space. It looks very nice for the price. There's not much in the way of support in the center of the desk, so leaning on it causes it to bow some in the center, but I use it primarily for a laptop so item weight there hasn't been an issue. I live in an apartment with 4 other people. My tiny room is already jam packed with stuff and my housemates didn't want me putting a desk in our shared space. This is absolutely perfect for my needs. I, a very small and weak human, can assemble it in less than a minute, including the time it takes to carry it down the hall. It's not super heavy (not super light either, but very reasonable for what it is), and if I'm having a good day I can carry both pieces at the same time. I slide it behind a bureau when I'm not using it and it takes up basically zero space. It's also really well made, stands flush to the floor, and is big enough to have a laptop, keyboard, books, and a few plants on top.  Definitely one of the better purchases I've made! ", "Great table design, very sturdy, ridiculously easy to put together. Bought two, both had a scratch on the top, kept them both anyway cause I liked them so much and not hugely noticeable.  Box was not damaged and intact, so it had to of happened in packaging. What I liked about this desk was how sturdy it is and how easy it is to set up. You need to correctly align the desk to the rail's connectors or else you're gonna have a bad time. I have a 28-inch 4K monitor, my lamp, keyboard, drawing tablet and mouse all on this desk and its not wobbly or creaks. Its actually pretty good and I have had it for a long time without no complaints. The paint might chip off, but other than that, I love it. Easy to assemble. Looks nice, clean, and simple. Is this a fancy piece of heirloom furniture? No. Should that be your expectation? No. Perfect as a desk I can use in the corner of our living space due to this new work-from-home situation. Took about 12 days to arrive. This product was easy to put together and does not take a lot of space. I am using as extra space when I need more desk space. (Is your desk ever big enough??) It seems sturdy. The top is a little rough to write directly on it, but is fine with something underneath the paper. And my dog's bed fits under the desk, which is important for me. I needed a desk for schoolwork (returning to college as an adult) but am short on space. This desk fit perfectly in my room (don't judge the panelling, we're remodelling at the end of the year lol). It wasn't too difficult to set up and it's pretty sturdy. I wouldn't do jumping jacks on it, but it will hold your books and computer (and your head if you need a nap) just fine. Shown is a 15.6\" laptop and single subject notebook for size comparison. The surface has a light texture to it, but my (cheap) optical mouse doesn't have an issue on the surface, and when moving the mouse along the surface the mouse smoothly glides over the texture, so you don't feel it with the mouse. The finish is a darker neutral/cool brown color, similar to a med/dark walnut color. I've had it for over 3 months now and have had no issues at all. I recently moved to a new house. Although I have reacquired office space--a real plus--the space for y office is much smaller. This desk is perfect for that space. It arrived on time, was easy up as soon as it was out of the box. The desk area is not the expanse I'm used to, but it really cuts down on my personal clutter. A comfortable size, a reasonable work space, and it looks good. I'm pleased with my purchase and would buy this again. Bought this as a temporary desk and was planning to eventually give it to son for his studio.  This table is exactly what I wanted.  It took 3 minutes to assemble: open the metal stand, put the top and align plastic catchers to the metal rod designed for this and push a bit to secure.  This is light enough for even a 12 year old to carry and assemble.  It's not flimsy, does not rock or sway.  It lays flat for storage. I'm rating it and all time 5 star due to ease and practicality, the materials are not substandard.  Oh, and not to mention, it does not look very nice and not cheap looking. This is a fantastic little desk. I run D&D games and wanted to extend the table area a bit to let me spread out my books, dice tower, laptop, etc without taking up too much of the dining room table. This is PERFECT. It's very lightweight but sturdy enough for what I need. It was a BREEZE to assemble. I sat down with some tools expecting an IKEA type assembly job but instead I just had to unfold the base and snap the tabletop in place.  If you are looking for something attractive and light duty, this is a good option. I've used this for a few months: It sets up in minutes, super easy! It is reasonably sturdy and has lots of leg room and surface area. It doesn't look cheap. Recently purchased to create a home office set up now that I'm working from home due to COVID. If you are an indecisive person like myself, it's hard to make purchases like this sight unseen. What attracted me most was size and the ability to easily put together and store the desk. I am able to fit a lamp, laptop and monitor on the desk. I loved the ease to put together (literally less than 10 minutes). Don't pass up this buy!!!! ", "If you are tight on space and want something easy not only to assemble but move if you ever needed to, BUY THIS. I love how quick and easy it was to assemble and being a female who is not super strong I loved that I could move it my self. Of course the top is not real wood but that is to help with its weight. You could easily build the square top if you wanted it to be real. But for me its perfect in every way it promised. This desk was a pleasant surprise. Our son has a small bedroom, but needed a desk for schoolwork. So many folding tables were too large or better suited to a child. He's I'm college, so it needed to be reasonable for an adult to still maneuver around. We gave it to him for Christmas and he uses it every day. It was far more sturdy than I thought it would be. Plus, when he needs the floor space, he can fold it and easily store it. This desk by far is the easiest piece of furniture I have ever put together! It\u2019s perfect for my home office needs. It has a good fake wood look, however needs to be handled gently, because it can scratch easily. I\u2019m ok with that because I knew that going in. Another plus is that if it needs to be put away or moved to a new location it folds up nicely and can be hidden in a closet or put in my car. Very happy with purchase This is a fine-looking simple desk, for the price. It has a 3-sided metal frame on top of which the wooden table goes and clips on. The table can be later unclipped and the frame sides can fold so it's easy to move if you need to. This is an excellent product, however, I purchased it for $60 a few months back. Was considering purchasing a second one, but this product is absolutely NOT worth $90. A 50% increase in price is ludicrous. I really like the concept of this desk; I have a small house, so the size and storage capabilities are great. This is the easiest piece of furniture I\u2019ve ever put together. The downside is that the top is pretty flimsy. I have a home office with two 27\u201d monitors and the middle sags a lot. I was able to reinforce it a bit, but if you\u2019re planning on having more than a laptop on it, this may not be for you. Perfect for my needs - desk easily has enough room for a fullsize keyboard with at least 6-8\" on both sides. I've got a lamp, school books, planners and more with no issue. The one thing I will say is that the support on the back forms an X at the exact level of my outlets, which was an issue for placement. Having the desk slightly offset from the outlet solved this issue for me. Do not plan on having a lot of weight in the middle of this desk, as it will bend. This is only an issue when a family member tries to lean their entire body weight on the desk  - not during normal use when resting/leaning arms on the desk while sitting. Simple and stylish, and fits my needs. My primary desk was out of space because of Keyboard, external drives, desk chargers and USB hubs.  Didn't have room to pay bills or study and write notes.  This is perfect size for a writing  or study desk and it won't break the bank.  Easy to set up and very sturdy.  I may have to purchase another as a platform for my Aquarium. I ordered this desk to help with a temporary homeschooling situation and I have to tell you, if you are looking for a desk that looks nice, is sturdy, is ridiculously easy to assemble/disassemble, look no further!  This desk is absolutely perfect!  It's lightweight, but solid and it will easily work with any space - big or small.  I would highly recommend purchasing this desk if you are looking for something that you can set up and take down.  It's literally two pieces - no tools necessary to set up.  I promise you will not be disappointed! THE EASIEST FURNITURE I\u2019VE EVER PURCHASED! ", "I love my desk, and the matching shelves. So easy for me to fold and move them. The desk is a little small for working on, but that also makes it perfect for small spaces. Also, I just remodeled my room, and the black metal was just wrong in the space, so I spray painted all the metal silver, and it looks awesome with the wood tops. I strongly suggest this product for anyone in small spaces or someone who likes to move furniture around.  It also stores super easy because of the folding metal. Like other reviews have said, this thing is not the most well-made. It seems like problems vary, but mine was that one of the bars that the wooden part latches to isn't fully welded to the table frame. Likewise, I don't think the table ends up being totally level. That said, it's not hugely noticeable, and considering the price, weight, and portability of the item, I still think this was my best bet. Compared to other desks like this, you either have to pay a lot more, or you get something that weighs 70 plus pounds. I've been moving a lot from place to place at this period in my life, so something that I'll be moving around a few times weighing that much is kind of a dealbreaker for me. So, if you're okay with dealing with a small quirk or two for the desk, it's very versatile and affordable. It also looks pretty good, and the no-nonsense rectangle design gives you a lot of surface area for the space it takes up. Again, would recommend, but just be ready for a weird flaw in your table when you get it! You could not find an easier setup, it took 2 minutes to get out of box and setup. I needed a small table that I could put up at the beginning of my work day and could take down at the end when my home office transitions to other uses. This works perfectly. Easy up and easy down yet stable and nice looking. It is a good height, pretty much level with my computer desk with plenty of leg room. I am 5'6\" but it would accomodate someone taller with ease. It folds up and fits against a wall needing only inches for storage. Excellent product. Just got this desk and loved it at first, then noticed that the paint was chipped on the edge of the desk. This crack in the desk coating is exposing the particle board and is starting to flake off which is really disappointing. I love all the other aspects of this desk and would return the desk top for a non-cracked one but I don\u2019t have the time (I need a desk for school and work). I also wish the desk top was made of stronger material, not particle board, as it does flex when an amount of pressure is applied. Overall, the concept is great, and I may have just gotten a defective desk top, but I do wish my coating wasn\u2019t already chipping away! The bar the top snaps onto already broke. This part is welded together. But it was cheap and doing the job it was built for. Going to throw away when we move. I work from home full-time and don\u2019t have an office, so I needed a desk big enough for a large monitor that could be easily stowed away. This desk was absolutely perfect for my needs, lots of pros: I work remotely and we decided to take a family vacation out of state.  I needed a desk for my laptop, monitor and documents I was working with.  I needed something that I could put in the SUV for traveling, but sturdy enough to hold a 15\" laptop, 2 large monitors, and the papers I was working on.  This desk is amazing!  It snaps together solidly and the top rests on the sides so it is very sturdy.  I am extremely impressed and will be looking to this manufacturer for any portable furniture needs in the future.  I am actually looking at adding the table right now. THIS IS THE FUTURE! Foldable furniture, easy to move and it looks BEAUTIFUL! I bought two of these to make a L shaped desk. It looks great in my studio! I recently had an art show and I was able to fold both the desks and take them with me. I didn't even have to use a table cloth because not only did my product look great on the tables but everyone complimented my desk! It's just about 39 inches wide and fit perfectly. Has a good amount of length to it and my MacBook horizontally is about 1/3 - 1/2 of the  length. ", "For the price, you can't beat this desk.  Took around 5 minutes to take out of the box, unwrap and assemble.  Literally 2 steps to assembly ~ unfold metal frame and fasten desktop to frame.  By far the easiest furniture assembly in my lifetime.  It's definitely not ideal for a 60\" TV or super heavy items, but it is sturdy enough to hold any desktop computer (I have a 27\" iMac on it).  Its also just large enough to serve its purpose but takes up minimal space.  So if you have a small room or are short on space, its perfect.  Stop looking and buy this one. I have a small therapy office and needed a compact yet durable table. I was skeptical due to a low price but decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how great the table is. I am a young woman and don't have much experience putting things together, I was once again surprised how easy it was to set up without much hassle. I was able to do it in 15 minutes. Can't say enough good things about my table. Love it! This desk is nice for small spaces and was very easy to assemble. However- I tried to use this as a work desk for my laptop with a monitor and the tabletop is too thin and flexible. It made my monitor shake and look blurry when I typed. The tabletop needs to be thicker or have some additional support underneath to make it more stiff. This desk may work as a writing desk, but if you are going to use it for a laptop or monitor it will not work as well. My 12 year old assembled it by himself, with no tools and no assistance. You don\u2019t even need instructions. Super easy to assemble. Good size and has many uses. The top will scratch in no time so has to be protected if you want to keep it nice. I found a bit expensive for what it is. But useful for us. A  really great price for an easy-to-assemble and simple desk.  My teen put it together himself.  He is using it for a monitor and gaming system.  The wood finish top is better looking in person than in the picture. Desk arrived quickly and with no damage It took longer to take out of the box than to set up!  The design is fantastic.  The legs just unfold, and all you have to do it snap on the top.  SO EASY!  This has solved my desk problem. Since I don't have a designated office, I was moving from place to place all over our house with my computer.  I saw this desk, and it fits perfectly behind my loveseat in my living room, so I can have \"command central\" without anyone really seeing my mess.  I would totally buy this again. This product is exactly as advertised and has worked out great. I purchased this (in light of current working conditions) to supplement a desk I had previously purchased. The set up was incredibly easy with the following steps: Supremely easy to set up. Literally just open the base like a window and pop the flat surface top on. It's pretty stable except the middle of the table top does bend ever so slightly. As long as no one sits on it (why would anyone), I think it's fine. ", "Wow was this desk such a surprise!! I thought for the price that it would just be an ok desk but it really blew me away. It was easy to assemble, light weight, the perfect height for an at home desk, and when you fold it away it doesn\u2019t take much space at all. I have a more modern apartment and it fits right in to the rest of the decor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND \ud83d\udcaf What a great desk.  I was looking for something simple and attractive to put in my front room since I am now working from home.  I didn't want anything too hard to assemble.  This thing was a breeze, I literally pulled it out of the box and within 1 minute it was up.  It looks great.  Has just the right amount of space, it is study and has great leg room.  Not to mention you can't beat the price.  I love this desk! I needed a small fold up desk that could be stored away under a bed in the guest room when not in use and this desk is exactly that. It's actually getting a lot more prolonged use than I first intended lately, and I'm still quite happy with it. I do with the table top board was a little thicker. g There is a bit of flex) but for what I paid for the desk it's more than good enough. This desk is a lot sturdier than it looks.  It didn't wobble for me, and feels like it can hold a lot.  Very easy assembly, as shown in the pictures included.  Two pieces, that's it.  Fold out the legs, then snap on the surface with the plastic clips on the underside.  I'm able to fit my legs beneath with my swivel chair at its full height.  I'm happy with it. Hear me out when I say that you could (and should) splurge a little extra on something that guarantees better quality. I purchased this desk due the cheap pricing and supposedly good reviews. When it arrived, it was already scratched in some areas. When I tried to assemble it, I noticed the joints on would not line up evenly and attach at once. It is practically impossible and is pretty much useless. Be a smart buyer and DON'T waste money on this piece of crap. You will not find a better bang for your buck.  This desk is very solid quality and VERY easy to put together.  Fold out the bars and snap on the top of the desk.  DONE.  That's it.  Nothing else.  It's really that simple.  This thing is freaking awesome! This desk is a great addition to my office!  I have it set up as an L-shape to my existing desk and it matches a bookcase I bought perfectly.  It is extremely sturdy and I really like the fact that it folds up too, although I plan to keep it set up as I use it daily.  The only thing I would note is that the surface is not smooth, so it's best to put something underneath if you are writing on it.  UPDATE:  I set a cup on the top and it left a ring that won't come up/out.  VERY DISAPPOINTING. Only took a minute to assemble. Looks great with my other mid century modern furniture in my apartment. My only complaint is that if I lean my elbow onto the desk while I am working, the surface tends to sag under the slightest weight even though it says it supposed to be able to hold 200 pounds. Otherwise this is a great desk or somebody looking for a fashionable desk at a affordable price. Cheaply made desk - maybe worth 1/2 to 1/3 total price as-listed. That said, it works in a pinch and isn't worth the hassle to return so I'll be using it. A little sad about the price tag though. I absolutely love this table, I had a bit of an issue but the seller/manufacturer worked together in solving my problem quickly. This desk looks great and is easy to store in virtually any room by leaning against a wall behind a dresser or under a bed, wherever you can. My only comment is that you should avoid having arm chairs rub against the finish as that could possibly degrade it. Love the desk, the finish is beautiful. ", "I have a studio apartment and needed an option that was easy to assemble, but also easy to put away for the days where I don't need a home office. This is lightweight, easy to use, and looks great in my place! Possible \"downsides\" include the ridged material that makes writing on paper less than desirable but I got a notebook to help with that. It also doesn't hold a LOT of weight, so just be careful - you can see it start to bow if you put too much weight on there. Otherwise, overall a great purchase! If you have a small room I highly recommend this desk. There are not that many foldable options for tables out there. This table is probably one of the 3 options you have. The reason you should get this table from the rest is that the material is very nice. This table feels very well made, the materials do not feel cheap, and it's very sturdy.  If you have a small room you can easily put this table under your bed, so get yourself a well-made collapsible desk for better optimization. Problem is when you rest your elbows on the desk for a bit the edge of the desk facing you is pretty sharp and it\u2019s uncomfortable even with and elbow pad on the desk. It also scratched the heck out of my arm and now I really wish I didn't purchase this. It is a spacious desk. Accommodates my desk lamp,  Macbook, Ipad, and bluetooth keyboard + mouse. It does bend downward when in use. I recently rented a room and needed a desk for my laptop. I also have a separate monitor that I use frequently. The desk is large enough and sturdy enough to handle both with room fo ran external keyboard, mouse and extra hard drive. The absolute weight limit for things sitting on top is 100 pounds, though. I kind of expected it to shake a bit while I was typing, but it's fine. It only moves slightly when bumped. It's a great solution for a small space. Simple assembly. Literally two pieces (frame and table top). Love it! It feels sturdy and goes well with my  design look. Package arrived fast, no damages, easy assembly. Another thing is that the wood looks very realistic which i love. I had to relocate one of the plastic holders that snap onto the rods of the legs since it was originally located too far and would not snap onto the rod. Since I know how to do it - it was easy. This little desk is just what I need to fit in a small space to help me work from home. It was very easy to unwrap and move just the two pieces upstairs to its new home. It was very easy to put together. This desk was the easiest and fastest thing I ever put together. No tools needed at all. It is pretty sturdy and the right height for most of us to slide under with our desk chair. Not the most fancy looking, but it was just what I looking for because I need a non obstructed view to my 50\" TV on a entertainment stand. Enough room to put all my junk and accessories on the desk. If you need no draws this is perfect, I have desk in the center of the room. Overall it\u2019s a nice desk that\u2019s really easy to setup in less than 5 minutes.  I like the fact that it can also be folded up and stored away in a closet or underneath a bed if needed. My only complaint which I find it hard to believe no one has mentioned is that the wood top is already bowing in the middle from the weight of my 27\u201d 10lb monitor. How has nobody brought up this flaw? I\u2019ve had this thing for literally 2 days and I imagine it will get worse after a while but for the price and ergonomics I can\u2019t complain too much. ", "I was a little hesitant about ordering a $50 desk from amazon. But I\u2019ve been wanting a new desk for my room for a while now so I decided to buy this one. I really liked the color and the size. When I got it, the set up was SO easy! My friend and I set it up in 5 minutes. It\u2019s the perfect size and it\u2019s not too big! There\u2019s the perfect amount of work space on the desk. Pretty sturdy and looks great. I highly recommend this product if you\u2019re on the search for a new desk! This desk is super! It comes semi-assembled, which means the metal foldable frame already comes put together as one piece, all you have to do is put the table top one top and snap it into the metal frame to make the table complete. Assembly takes only 5 minutes once out of the box, no tools are needed! It may be a little hard to align table plastic snaps to metal frame, just do one on each side at time (alternate between sides). For example, do one snap on the right side then snap another on the left, alternate so that they can align properly and don't be afraid to apply force, just make sure the metal frame is under the snap, you don't want to break the snap off. Once table top is on the table is sturdy and large enough to fit multiple books, a computer and possibly a printer. It is super convenient especially for small spaces because it is super easy to take down apart as well. All you have to do is take the table top off and fold up the metal frame. It is flat too, so it's good for laying against the wall or pushing underneath the bed for storage! I got this table to have something to study on in my room that has enough room for my books and computer. I live in NYC so my room isn't super spacious to have a table always sitting in the middle of my room. So, when I am done studying. I just fold the table up and place it against my wall. It is totally worth the money! Perfect size for my needs.  I have an MSI GP73 laptop, 2 jbl extremes, and lamps on the desk.  It's very minimalistic, which is refreshing now that most desks are too complicated and I think ugly.  This is metal and wood.  Very industrial, which is my style anyways.  Love it. It's super easy to put together, very cute and light-weight. I would not suggest putting something very heavy in the center as it noticeably dips inward a little, but besides that it's great. Great desk for working from home in a small apartment where you have no space for a real desk. Super lightweight and easy to pop off the top, fold the frame, and cram under a bed. Only issue I have is the picture showing the Apple monitor and keyboard is extremely misleading. They must have photoshopped that monitor in the pic, because I have a 30\" Apple monitor and it takes up literally half the desk. Not really any regrets in my purchase, but I wish I would have known about that space issue. I guess it's my fault for not taking the measurements listed on the site into consideration. Wood panel almost looks plastic btw. I'm not sure if it's real wood or not, but it has a coasting on it that looks like fake wood. Still does the trick. 4 stars. I needed a desk that was large and strong enough to hold a large monitor, a docking station and the various peripherals that goes with having a laptop for work.  It had to fit in a tiny space I have allocated in my living room for my workspace.  I also needed something I could easily fold and put away at a moments notice.  This desk fit the bill so perfectly.  It came in a large box with the wood top as one solid piece with the metal frame folded.  The two sides fold in quiet easily.  Assembly was super easy, just open up the metal frame and pop the top on, and done. The study desk is very nice. It isn't too big or too small and I can use it to to things on a laptop with a lot of breathing space. The only problem was the assembly. Almost every corner of the top part snapped in perfectly, but there was ONE corner where it just didn't seem to even fit. It looked like it was screwed in too far to one side but eventually it snapped in with much force (and maybe a hammer). The bar holding the table up seems to be a bit weak, but it holds the weight, so maybe that's just me. It is a comfortable height and a GREAT desk. 4.3/5 This little desk is exactly what I needed. I didn't need anything fancy or too big, and this desk fit the bill. It was literally a snap to put together! The legs come hinged onto the back piece, so all you do is fold them out and the top snaps on to the bars. Can't get much simpler than that! Good price too at $55. Love it! Open up and snap the top on - thats it! Its really durable and looks great. Very happy with this desk, I hate when furnishings come with a bunch of bolts & screws. This small desk has been a huge addition to my office.  It allows us to create an office space in an office that does not have room for a desk.  it is large enough to function for work but small enough to fit almost anywhere.  It is light and easily moveable.  I highly recommend it for someone with similar needs.  You can break it down and set it up in seconds! ", "Got mine in the mail today. Very easy to assemble, it's good for the small space I had. The top feels like board, not hard wood. The edges are sharp and not smooth so if work for long hour be mindful to not rest your arms on there for too long. Maybe the manufacturer will come up with a product with smooth edges on the front of the wood in the future. Slightly high priced. 3.7/5 Received and was unboxed and set up in 5 minutes. This is such an amazing life saver! I have been working from home and will continue to work from home until October and this is so perfect in my small apartment. I can break it down every weekend or whenever I\u2019d like to. The top is heavy and feels like real wood. It\u2019s super sturdy. Looks expensive and nice. Just all around 10/5 stars. Thank you thank thank you!! And thank you from my sister who can begin using the kitchen table again! LOVEEE Works nice. BUT--- Middle/front had a natural sag to it- and could stand to use some support. While sitting at it, it's ok, but from farther away, you an see the top starting to bow down. The back is supported fine, but the front middle is not. Otherwise, it looks great- and was amazingly easy to put together. It folds open and takes like 30 seconds to setup. To me- the sagging quality of it is what warrants the 3-star review. The assembly for this desk is painless and can be done in less than a minute! This was a huge sell for me as I've recently moved and bought the desk to replace my old particle board walmart special which I could not take apart as all the locking screws were stuck. It ended up breaking in the move. The desk is sturdy and as pictured. The finish on the desk surface is slightly rigid or faux wood grain so it is not a smooth writing surface alone. It could also easily be resolved by buying a big desk calendar to protect the surface while writing. There's room to fit small file cabinets underneath and the iron sides make the desk a less cumbersome options for smaller spaces or to reduce clutter. I travel a lot and stay in AirBnbs for work. I'm a coder and a real desk is a must. I got this so I could always have a consistent workspace on my travels. It has been wonderful. I thought it might be a little flimsy or cheap, but it is not. It is light and easy to assemble, break down, and transport. Once together it is quite sturdy and doesn't have hardly any wobble. My only wish is that the legs would clip to something when it's in the folded position. When your carrying it the legs are just kinda lose and flop around. I started using some twist ties, but sometimes they break off. Stores nice and flat in the trunk of my car. Highly recommend. This thing is great, no exaggeration! I ordered this table to use as my husband's computer desk/table.  He has a small space in our home office space we use for our business.  His space is for personal use only.  The size of the table is perfect for the space available and Bought these desk because I didn\u2019t want to spend all my time building furniture and this was the best and easiest desk I\u2019ve ever set up. It was so easy and I anticipate it will also be easy to move! I have enjoyed using this desk to study on with my computer. All my studying is done on the laptop so this wasn\u2019t too small for me but if you have a lot of notes and books this would be small I\u2019d imagine. Depends on your needs! I'm sad cause this was a great desk for students. Then the cheap material, weird fake wood, began wobbling a lot when I put my new desktop iMac and when I was moving the table, the screw panel came fight of the table on the left side (with a chunk of fake wood). It was such a bummer because the desk is collapsible and made moving so easy but its not a great product. I ordered this desk because it is simple, functional, and incredibly easy to assemble (I've put together way too much Amazon and Ikea furniture in my life). When I ordered the first time, it arrived without incident and serves its purpose well enough. I decided to buy a second one to expand my available desk workspace without committing to something larger or more difficult to assemble. When the second desk arrived, it had an enormous crack up the middle of the wood panel and was warped to the point of not fitting the frame. The box was not damaged, to it seems that the desk itself was defective prior to shipping. The desk is also packaged in an ungainly, irritating way - crammed into a box barely large enough to hold both pieces. So, I'm returning it for a replacement, but now I've had to re-box this thing in its ill-fitting packaging, and I have to wait two more days for the same item. ", "Bought two of these for the wife\u2019s new Cricut workspace.  She\u2019s new to the hobby, but excited to give it a go.  She needed ample space for all the materials and attachments, so I bought 2 of these for her, and we set them up in an \u2018L\u2019 shape in the corner of her hobby room.  They look great.  Assembly was a snap, pun intended.  0 effort... superb!  0 tools needed. Cute and lightweight desk that is easy to assemble/disassemble, and put away. It's very aesthetic. However, keep in mind the top/table portion of this table is not made of solid wood, and bends a bit upon weight. It can withstand my laptop and all my books, but if I put a bit of my body weight on it, it will bend a bit. One corner of the top was damaged.  The outer box looked intact, but the damage was constant with having been dropped on a corner before the inner box was packed into the outer box: i.e. not a shipping problem.  The top is pressboard covered by plastic. that has a wood look.  I needed a last minute desk and had no option but to keep and use this, as I could not stand and do my work during my office renovations.  It is a $25-30 table. This is the problem with buying site unseen.  I put it together and moved on. Would not buy again. This looks great and it was so cheap! If you are looking for a nice wood accent, not so big table for work or studying then this is a it. I love the fact that the top can just pop off and the legs could fold for easy transport or storage. I wish I went for this kind of table rather than an actual desk when I was in college. Currently I have a laptop, speakers , and plenty of room for my mouse when gaming. So small and compact but plenty of space still. I have a small room and this fits my iMac and laptop perfectly with some room for books/pen holders/etc. Super easy to assemble and easier to fold/store! It\u2019s pretty sturdy, however, I don\u2019t recommend putting too much weight on it (sitting/standing on it). Would definitely recommend to any student or someone with lack of space I moved into a new apartment and this table was exactly what I needed it to be. The table was very easy to assemble, taking about 15 minutes or so, and has been a pretty durable table considering the amount of stuff I put on it. It helps that the dark wood and metal look is very stylish if you're going for a modern look for your room. The only downside I have is that the table doesn't have a lot of leg space so try not to put too many things underneath the table or you're going to find yourself bumping into a lot of things as you're sitting down. Incredibly light weight and easy to assemble. It stands at a good height so if you're tall you won't bang your knees. Just have to mind your fingers when you put the desktop on I use this desk in my kitchen area that we use as the family room.  My daughter loves having it there so she can do her homework without having to be at the island.  The desk is super easy to set up and it literally takes longer to unpack it than to snap the top onto the base.  I love that it can be folded and put away when not in use though we plan to leave it up all the time. The worst thing about flat packed furniture is the time it takes to assemble them and the bad instructions in most cases. Due to stay at home requirements I purchased this desk to create a workspace in my bedroom. It is perfect! I told all of my colleagues and now we all have matching desks again! Bought one for my college student as well. He loves it ", "I just needed an inexpensive desk to use in my basement-makeshift office during the pandemic.  This works well, but it doesn\u2019t fold up as easily as I had anticipated. The top comes off and connects only with four plastic clips which will probably break easily if you disassembled the desk too often. So, I am just leaving it set up 24/7. Also, as I anticipated, the top piece is not very sturdy so don\u2019t purchase this desk if you intend to put a lot of stuff on it. You will want something sturdier. It works well for what I wanted it to do, and it\u2019s pretty much what I expected for the price, so I am satisfied. Like many of us, COVID-19  quickly illuminated some unexpected challenges with my WFH situation.  After realizing that my kitchen table would not be a suitable long term solution, I needed to set up a dedicated office workspace within a limited footprint.  For the price point this desk is ideal.  It comes in two pieces (frame & desktop), so setup takes 5 minutes.  It can easily be broken down and tucked away if needed. And the quality is good enough where I feel comfortable it will last beyond the point where I will still need it.  For $100 you can't go wrong with this option. This was super simple to set up and was a matter of just sliding the legs into place. It was packaged well and came un damaged. It looks pretty decent for the price but has a somewhat plastic feel. Needed a desk for hobbies and my sewing machine and this has been perfect. Would recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive but reliable desk Took me about 5 minutes to assemble. I was able to put a monitor, a laptop, my wireless mouse and keyboard on this. The space under the desk will hold a lot, put a 3 tower shelf or something to hold your office supplies. It makes a good home office. I paired it with another amazon chair and it holds up well so far, no issues! The product looked nice, and was super simple to install. My complaints would be the imbalance it had. I had to use a few quarters as shims to get the legs even. My other complaint would be the lack of rigidity I felt it had. Even lightly resting my forearms on the desk seemed to make it bow down a little, just felt a bit flimsy. I am still happy about the purchase and for the price I think it would be difficult to find a good replacement I bought this desk once I started working from home permanently due to the pandemic. I have a one bedroom apartment and the desk is small enough to fit in my room. Super easy to put together and take apart if needed. For the price, I am very pleased with this desk. It also looks a lot more expensive than it actually is. Highly recommend if you need a cheap desk that doesn't take up too much space. This is perhaps the first time I'm writing a review without being asked via an email from Amazon. I L-O-V-E this desk! It took me more time to remove it from the box (thanks for the secured packaging Amazon) than it did to assemble this lovely desk. Don't be discouraged however this desk is sturdy and awesome for tight spaces. I can go on and on, just buy it, you'll be glad you did!! Exactly what I was looking for! I turned my folding door closet into an office that I can close away when I'm not using. It's a small closet, so I needed a narrow desk and this is perfect! It took me approximately 30 seconds to put together and it feels sturdy and doesn't look cheap. Just enough space for a wide screen monitor and laptop - and plenty of room left for a keyboard and mouse pad. Highly recommend! I really liked the look of this desk, the low price, and the generally good reviews. I was not that lucky, however. One end of one of the plastic clips that attaches to the frame was completely off and it was obvious to me this wasn't due to damage from shipping. Much to my further disappointment, the rest of the clips were not aligned properly so even if they were all secure it still would not have attached to the frame properly. I am definitely returning this. To echo other reviews: you get what you pay for. I bought this desk because I\u2019d been searching for a nice antique sewing/craft desk and hadn\u2019t had any luck. Since these are affordable and easily stored I settle on them as a temporary until I could find what I was looking for. ", "This desk was exactly what I needed for my Mac PC.  A little extra desktop space for a small lamp, writing pad and a cup of coffee, too.  I read reviews where people commented the desktop bowed in the middle under too much weight, but then I don't think this desk was built to support stress in the first place.  I think it was made more for space economy and ease of storage.  It's a nice metal frame that folds open, and then you simply pop a faux-wood plank on top.  That's it.  So I would suggest keeping the usage simple, too.  For me, I like it because it's exactly what I needed, exactly what I expected, and it is easy for me to put together and take apart. This table is perfect for doing crafts.  The table top is very sturdy and the entire table is a nice piece of functional furniture. I am very impressed with the quality of this desk.  It is super easy to set up (no initial assembly required beyond unfolding the legs like you would do every time you set up).  And it's quite stable and solid for being portable.  Nice surface, good height. This desk is SO easy to set up - no tools needed.  It takes LESS than 5 minutes from opening the box to admiring it's chic-ness in your home office.  Industrial rustic, while it's plastic and metal, it gives the appearance of hard wood that is very in-style right now.  I've had one for 6 months, and just ordered another to make an L shape in my office because they rock that much.  So affordable as well! Omg! When I tell you I LOVE this desk!!!! I was waiting all day for it to come in. I finally got it and started unpacking it. It took me longer to unpack the box than it did to put the thing together. It took me maybe 1 minute to put everything together. After I decorated it and then voila! It was done. It came clean and free of scratches. The desk is perfect and beautiful. I would recommend this for sure. It was one of the more affordable \u201cexpensive\u201d ones. I couldn\u2019t find another desk anywhere that was both fashionable and affordable for this price. And that includes the fact that it was so easy to out together as well. Totally recommend, get it!!!! I wanted something easy to assemble, and this was perfect! No boyfriend or dad needed lol Put it together in less than 3 mins. The board snaps in with a hard push. It is pretty sturdy for the most part. I wasn't sure about the color of the faux wood, but actually looks great. It is \"grainy\" so if you want to write like on a piece of single paper, you will have to place something underneath it so it will be smooth. I like that it is not bulky at all, it is simple and modern. Looks great against a lighter wall. I don't put too much trust in reviews because I always wonder which are actually true and not obtained through free samples. However, this is very sturdy, can be assembled in two minutes the most, and does not wobble. The only thing to know, which I did before I purchased, is that the texture of the table top is not a smooth texture you can write on.  But I love it. I just use padding in my writing area, (sort of like a huge mouse pad) and it is perfect. Love the look of this desk. It is the easiest piece of furniture I\u2019ve ever assembled. Two clicks and you\u2019re done. Fits in my small space well. It is pretty light weight so it isn\u2019t the sturdiest on carpet but that doesn\u2019t bother me because this desk is just what I was looking for. I loved everything about the desk when I got it. Shortly, one of the legs bent out of shape (picture attached). While it still works, it\u2019s a little Wobbly and I have to worry even when using anything besides just my laptop and notebook. Spectacular! A true sanity saver for me. I was able to quickly set up a COVID19 remote workstation in my home. The desk is easy to put snap together and looks great! I will have many used for this desk/table after all this social distancing is no longer required and I\u2019m back in the office more. ", "I work from home and needed a small desk for a small space, but enough room for my stuff. This desk was literally the easiest thing I've ever assembled! Literally take it out of the box and pop the top on the legs and you're done! My computer and all my things fit on top nicely, I have tons of leg room, and it fits great in a small space in my living room. Definitely satisfied with my purchase!! I've had this for about 2 1/2 months and it is still intact in spite of being subjected to hard use by a teenager.  It looks modern and works well for it's intended purpose.  My teenager has two laptops and a PS4 on it and it is crowded.  Other than being a little small for his purpose, I think it's a good value.  Super easy to set up. This is both the easiest desk I have ever bought... and the sturdiest for the money.  Had to setup a 48\" TV on it originally, until I got my new monitor... and had no worry about it falling apart.  No screws, bolts or figuring out what goes where.  Simply unfold and place the top on it... and you are finished. Great desk! Sooo Easy to assemble! Took me about 5 minutes to unbox and assemble! Nice that it could be folded if needed to be moved or stored away. Not as long as it looks in the pictures.. wish I had a measuring tape but overall content with my purchase. Does not wobble and like the texture that makes it look like real would (Not smooth surface) but I\u2019m okay with that. Would recommend for small spaces. I ordered 2 of these desks for my niece's rooms and also a similar book shelf that coordinates just great. This desk was THE EASIEST piece of furniture I have eve assembled and it's so practical, a perfect size for what we needed and the price was right! So glad I purchased this as it will work in a number of rooms in the future and is easy to store if at some point it won't be needed. Absolutely awesome! It's a decent desk especially for the price. Two slight complaints.... 1) Top is a little off on the right side. Snapped in place on the left but right didn't. It's only off a little and really won't make a difference. 2) Top gives slightly so if you have anything heavy in the front middle it will bow a little. Why they didn't use a more solid particle board I don't know. I wanted to love this desk but it just wasn't usable so I had to return it.  It is very narrow so fitting two monitors and a keyboard is out of the question.  Definitely more of a writing/journalingdesk than a substitute for a 'working form home' desk.  The edges are also sharp so dig into your forearms when typing.  If is super cute otherwise j I love this desk!  It is sturdy and fits perfectly in my studio apartment.  It's simple to put together and then quickly folds down so it can be stored behind a leaning mirror.  I had been sitting on the floor with my laptop prior to purchasing this desk (and that worked fine), but having this desk makes a world of difference.  I am so glad I purchased this desk. I love that this can be broken down into two pieces when i need it out of the way! With all of this quarantine we needed a good desk to work from while I attend school and we love the look and the sturdiness! - bought this table due to high review ", "I needed a desk because I started working from home and my apartment is very small. This desk is a nice size, I was able to fit my laptop and an extra monitor with space to write in my journal. It was also very easy to assemble. Looks great and very solid. I bought this desk as a temporary fix but I ended up using it as my regular desk. It's great because it's easy to set up and light to move. All you do is unfold the base and the top snaps in the supporting bars. It's very sturdy. If you like working at a desk in different areas of your house I highly recommend it because of its easy mobility. It folds flat enough to easily store under or behind a couch or bed. It took a long time to get to me and the delivery date was change 4 times. When it arrived I was mad a the situation but after we started using it I really like it! We buy a leather mat because the relief of the cover makes it difficult to write or sign papers but I really like it. I actually ordered 2 of these because after I ordered the first one I like it so much I turned around and ordered one for my daughters room.  Its not an expensive looking desk but it is of good quality for what it is.  It was SO EASY to put together and is very durable.  Great size and quality for what we needed. I have never ordered a mail order table that was easier to assemble.  It took longer getting it out of the box.  This is a perfect table or desk for anybody working on the road.  Very compact, Very study.  Tear down and reassemble in seconds.  Had to buy a second one. Perfect inexpensive desk for my small space. I needed something that would fit in the corner of my bedroom and this worked perfectly. It was really easy to assemble and lightweight. Only drawback is that it is very cheap material but that is okay for the price and it will serve its purpose of holding a laptop. Happy with it overall. Bought this to accommodate my son's desktop while staying at my mom's for the weekend.  Flat box for transport in our SUV.  On arrival, opened Box, unfolded legs, snapped in desktop....WAH-LAH!!  On departure, took off top, folded legs, put back in box, stores easily at home for next use...Holiday Cocktail Bar!!  ***The top is \"wood-like\", not actual wood, But sturdy and attractive enough to be seen and easy to keep clean! At first glance I thought, \u201cno way this will hold up\u201d. So far I am wrong. This desk was super easy to assemble, no tools needed! You pop up the frame then lock the table top in place and BAM! You\u2019re done. It probably took the UPS driver longer to bring the package from his truck to my front porch than it did for me to assemble this. I would definitely buy this again. I purchased this desk because I work from home and moved into a smaller space. I love the simple, modern look, the fact that it\u2019s lightweight, and was easy to assemble. However, after only 4-5 months, the fake wooden layer on the front of the desk started to chip. When I touch the chipped spots, it feels like the covering- which feels like thick paper- isn\u2019t even glued to the front of the desk so eventually it\u2019s going to fall off in chunks. I do use this desk 40 hours a week and it was budget-friendly, but the wear and tear I\u2019m seeing on this desk from where my hands rest while typing really happened way too quickly. Kind of disappointing purchase. ", "I love this desk so much, I bought four... one for each of the bedrooms upstairs. Each of us has a different need for the desk and it meets those requirements. I love this desk!  I had to purchase a desk for my bedroom due to needing a confidential space for work from home.  The size is perfect for the space I have available, it was super easy to assemble (no tools needed), and the finish is on point.  There were no visible flaws or defects in the workmanship.  Plus the best thing for me thinking about the future... it will be super easy to move as it can be easily taken down and won't take much room in a move.  This is a great find and a keeper for sure! I bought this desk to work from home occasionally. It fits my laptop, external monitor(24\"), keyboard, and mouse just fine. Although, after having all of that stuff on the desk there isn't much room for writing. If I had to buy another desk I'd look for something a little bit wider. I initially returned the item as it came to me mangled so badly that the weld broke! Moving forward three days when I received the replacement, the box was pristine. My husband put it together in about 5 minutes, and it is very sturdy. Exactly as pictured. Size of the desk is great for small spaces. The reason I\u2019ve put four stars instead of five: the legs of the desk aren\u2019t straight, they curve inward a bit. And the top part is very thin, I would not put too much weight on it. Seems like it would snap in half if you put too much on top. Overall not a bad product for the money, good value. Okay I knew this would be small, but it actually was the perfect size to put right next to my bed, so that ended up being a good thing. And it\u2019s big enough for my monitor... and my cat.. to sit comfortable. It took like 30 seconds to put together and didn\u2019t weigh much so it was easy to move to my room, but seems sturdy enough to where I won\u2019t worry about it falling or anything. So.. for a budget friendly cute desk, I recommend it! Like this desk for small nook area where I work from home. Meets my needs. Caution: Can't place hot beverages (tea/coffee) without a coaster underneath. Ring lines appear due to heat warping the finish? It doesn't bother me. Size wise the desks is great. Dont put too much weight on it since it's not the steadiness. Weird that its put together almost too easily. My problem is the giant scratch on the top when I recieved it. And it was wrapped up well and not destroyed outside the box which means it was like this before they shipped it to me. Finally the desk came after being delayed twice! Easiest thing to assemble! However, all four edges of the table look scratched up and not pretty (as pictures). I purchased the Matte Black desk so I can say for other colors and if they have the same issue. Also, the seller lost my first package and made me wait for over a month. Secone came in later than promised as well. Unsure if it's worth my time and money but I'll keep it just for the sake of my kid having his study desk . It seriously was the easiest thing i had to assemble. It seems to be quite sturdy. However, it could have been just 2 more inches deeper, then i would be accidentally kicking my wall all the time - but that's a me problem. Seriously, a nice and cheap desk solution for a notebook. Im pretty sure, as long as i never jump on it, it might last me a while. ", "I absolutely LOVE this desk. I couldn\u2019t believe the price for how it looks and the sturdiness. It\u2019s very sleep and stylish. Took under five minutes to set up and I love it for my work at home where I spend 8 hours daily. I even rest my feet on the back of the table. Love it!  Highly recommend! I love the smaller, elegant and simple style of this desk. It does not takes a lot of space. It can feet in any room. It is sturdy and it was so easy to assemble. (My 14 year old did it all by herself) Great value for the money. I will be buying more of this desks, because you can use them as small tables to place flower pots, decorations, etc, etc... Very disappointed that Amazon and the manufacturer delivered to me a damaged new product, with a major scratch on the metal frame, as you can see in the first picture. A product sold as new must look like new! I need to check the Amazon return policy for this product, but I cannot return this desk and have no desk at home while they send to me another one. I Purchased this desk because I needed to save some space in my apartment and I wanted to get rid of my much bigger desk so I decided why not get something that I can fold away as well. When the desk arrived, right out of the box I was loving it. The desk is only 2 pieces, The steel frame which is very sturdy and nicely finished and the desktop which is finished in some sort of synthetic wood but looks great. Once assembled this desk looks like a more expensive piece of furniture. So much that instead of folding it away after use like I originally planned, I Haven't taken it down yet. This desk is a great Value for the price and definitely recommended, I would purchase this desk 10x over if I had to. For someone who is pretty much useless when it comes to assembling things, this was a godsend. Literally only just unfold the legs and place the table top over them-- that's it. The quality is great for the pricing; I bought it in September as I was moving into my apartment, and it fits snugly into the corner. Even though it's designed for small spaces, I think you can store a decent amount of stuff on/under the desk. I had a two sets of plastic drawers stored underneath, as well as a lamp, my laptop, and my books on top. There's a lot of room to work with. I really love this desk; it's very lightweight, but it doesn't feel cheap-- also really dig the wood aesthetic. I love this desk! It's compact, super easy to assemble, sturdy, stylish... seriously this desk is all-around awesome and it's a wonderful price. I bought a second desk from a different brand recently and had a horrible experience... I'm buying this desk a second time due to needing more surface area. Can't wait!! Very light, good packaging. It took longer for me to take the desk out of the box, than it did to install. The U or C clamps (whatever you want to call them) made installation easy.  Took me about 30 seconds. The desktop looks great, not sure how it will hold up after a few spills. Overall, it is worth the price. It looked elegant at the beginning. But I like to drink hot tea, the surface is plastic and it\u2019s very easy to be broken by my hot tea cup. Don't buy it! This so nice to have. Sometimes I need a table for different projects, but we don\u2019t have a lot of space. This is sturdy and super easy to assemble. It hardly takes up any room when stored. I love this desk for the price, for the fact it\u2019s compact and folds up and because of how well it\u2019s made. I was shocked that the top (which clicks on) is made of a hard textured plastic that simulates wood grain, this was great for me because sometimes you get condensation rings from hot coffee or cold drinks. ", "Perfect for my bedroom/office. I was working on a TV tray and decided to upgrade to real desk. It\u2019s sturdy, big enough for both laptops and still room to write but it\u2019s not big or bulky. It snaps together easily. It took longer to open the box than to set up. The desk is big enough for both my 6 foot husband and my 5 foot 4 self however I wouldn\u2019t recommend leaning on it too heavily. The top is way too pliable to hold much weight and would probably snap if enough was put on. There is enough room to put a long piece of plexiglass or plywood right underneath for extra support if you really feel like you can\u2019t help but lean. We use this as a feeding station for our cat to keep the dog from gobbling up her food. It is VERY easy to assemble and equally easy to take apart for storage. It is well-made, stable, and doesn't wobble or flex. It is not high-style furniture, but looks pretty good. The table surface seems to be durable. No marks from kitty's claws yet despite her jumping up on it five or six times a day for the last month. This desk is designed for a laptop , monitor and a few books.  You cannot stand on this desk.  So if you're just looking for a simple desk for school, writing, work. It fits the bill.  I wish it were a little sturdier on the front so I could lean on it - as is my habit but I've just had to stop leaning on it. Small price to pay. This is a great looking desk and took literally five minutes to assemble from the time I got it in the door. This table was exactly what I needed for working at home.  It has a simple, minimalist style, but is sturdy and the size is perfect.  Super easy to assemble - take it out of the box, unfold the sides from the back, then snap on the top.  I would definitely buy this again. Love it. Perfect size and height for my space. Big enough for my laptop, extra monitor and wireless keyboard with a bit extra space for writing or whatever if needed.  Put together and take down are great. Hope it holds up.  Highly recommend. Love this product! I was looking for something for when I worked from home, but living in a studio I knew I didn\u2019t have a lot of space. Great thing about this is how easy it is to assemble, and how small it can get to store! Fits easily in the back of a closet or under a bed when folded. great value on this purchase. I bought if once i started remote working in march and i have a 1 BR apt and needed something smaller that would work for a home set up. NO tools required which was a big plus, put together in less than 5 mins and it has been great. nice surprise for the money and would buy it again.. leg room is good, desk surface hols my lap top, a monitor and a key board. A great desk all around This desk is good if you need a small desk for writing or just to put a few things on to make a small space organized. I never sit at the desk but I utilize it for organization on top and underneath. Really great for small spaces. You can easily assembly this desk by yourself.  I spent a months looking for a good desk and I wanted something functional that wouldn\u2019t be a pain to put together. I\u2019ve had it for 6 months now and I\u2019m happy with my purchase. ", "The table is sturdy, easy to set up, and looks decent. But there is a major flaw in the plastic material lining the top of the desk that I can't believe I didn't see mentioned in the reviews; it absolutely cannot handle heat without melting/damaging the material. I was drinking a cup of hot tea at the desk and the bottom of the cup left a very noticeable circle where the plastic material seems to have melted where the bottom of the cup contacted the desk. Very disappointed with this flaw in the desk. This is a very nice desk.  It is easy to assemble and stury.  My only issue is that it is taller that I expected.  I am only 5'4\" and I have to put a cushion in my chair to make it a better working height for me. Ordered this desk not expecting too much from it. Just needed something for my sons room. Its actually so easy to out together it took my husband less than a minute. It looks very nice and is light weight easy to move. The top is made from plastic however it looks like wood. Very good product for the price. This table is incredibly sturdy, holding a very heavy gaming tower, good space, doesn't wobble or bend, and I love the feel of the wood.  It has a good finish but you can't write directly on it, as it has the wood texture.  Overall, glad I bought it, and probably getting another one for my server machine! It looked used when I opened it as it had scuffs and scrapes on it. I opened it up after my return window passed. It looks like poor quality material was used. I do love the idea of being able to fold it away and would have been fine buying it for about $40, but definitely not the $100 I paid. Bought this as a means to study in my room for the days I can\u2019t go to the library. On my desk I have my 13inch MacBook, 8.5x11paper, wallet, camera, diffuser, and water bottle. Hopefully that can give ppl some perspective about the size. The table came in 2 pieces. The wooden desk and the metal frame that\u2019s foldable. All you had to do was unfold it and clamp the wooden desk onto the ridges of the frame. Don\u2019t expect some heavy duty desk tho. You definitely can\u2019t put your own weight on it as it\u2019ll probably break. But even still the wood is fairly stable. It\u2019s also extremely light weight The desk couldn't be any easier to put together, and looks pretty nice for being a portable desk. It's also a great size for a small space (I use it for storable office in the home). The only complaint I have, is that because the top snaps on to the frame only on the sides, it flexes quite a bit near the middle (I rest my elbows on it occasionally) so my monitor tilts a bit. An attached metal support under the top could help prevent this, but other than that it's a decent quality foldable desk. Perfectly sized desk and super easy to assemble. I was shocked at the ease of assembly and the way in which this could even be a travel desk of sorts. I use it in my bedroom, which isn\u2019t the biggest, and it looks great! If you\u2019re looking for a small desk that is easy to assemble, looks good and is affordable, take a gamble with this one! The best desk for small spaces. I customized mine with gold spray paint and marble stick-on paper. I love the outcome. It\u2019s perfect for customizing and the ease of assembly is refreshing. I been used this table for 1 year now with my laptop, the table is too high that after keep using mouse my wrist hurt and my arms are not comfortable at all. Other then that was good. ", "Wow. This desk is every thing! I\u2019m a nursing student so I needed a nice desk that wasn\u2019t an arm and a leg and was stylish yet simple. I got this and the matching bookshelf and the quality is fantastic. Literally takes you minutes to assemble. All you do is unfold it and snap the board in and you\u2019re good to go. It holds my haven arms resting and textbooks on it all day. I need a desk I could shimmy into a space in my living room. This item was easy to assemble, right out of the box, it basically just snaps in place! I love the wood grain top is not only for looks, but the texture is lovely. Not great for an art desk, if you need a flat space for work, but a perfect little modern desk for your computer or crafts. I've had this desk forever now and I'm in love with it! At first it was for my laptop and now I use it for my massive 27 inch monitor like a champ! Could use a little more space with this monitor but its nothing to complain about because it fits in my already cramped room! It's super easy to set up a chimp could do it! The only thing with it is I imagine its not great for writing on due to the surface not being really smooth, but that doesn't really bother me because I don't write on it. Great desk 10/10 recommended for people that need a desk in a small space! I procrastinated on getting a desk for my home as I always want to keep work seperate, however been working at home for over 4 months on a outdoor table and a laptop table.  This table I was able to get rid of both.  It is stable, able to fit monitor, laptop, and still have room for keyboard and mouse.  Plus I will be able to store it easily when I am able to return to the office Got it in a timely manner. I really love this desk, the ease of assembly is awesome and it looks great in my small space.  I have only one small issue and that is that the faux grain wrapper is already starting to peel.  It feels like this small section never adhered to the desk to begin with as I can feel an air bubble and the paper is starting to peel on the edge.  It's right where my arm rests while typing so I keep snagging it.  I will be really sad when it does finally become a larger tear.  If anyone knows how to fix this I'm all ears.  Other than that, I think this desk is great and I would buy again. Very pleased with this desk. It is very easy to assemble and is pretty sturdy. If you are looking for a desk that won\u2019t break the bank, this is it. Keep I. Mind that it doesn\u2019t have any storage such as drawers. Otherwise, compared to the others in this style, it\u2019s a good buy. This desk is amazing!!! The wood is fake but good quality. The metal work is trendy and looks amazing with our bedroom decor. The wood is a brown grey and is exactly what we needed. Barely any assembly and it is lightweight and perfect for storing if needed. I cannot recommend this enough. Let me start out by saying that this was truly an incredibly easy desk to set up. The legs open up like a gate and ideally the board falls flush with the frame and the clips. My desk however seems to be a bit off because there is obvious warping when I clipped the board on the frame.(pictures in review) The desk is not flush and I can't seem to remedy the situation by changing the orientation of the board or moving the legs. This would be a perfect desk otherwise. Could not be happier with this desk. It\u2019s essentially already assembled. The legs/frame are folded and the top snaps on. It\u2019s actually extremely sturdy. It\u2019s a simple, basic desk that has a very nice, modern look and will fit into many decors. For the price and ease of assembly, you can\u2019t beat this desk. I\u2019m considering buying more and using them as small tables. ", "The assembly is why I ordered it, aside from it looking nice enough.  Takes about 90 seconds to unfold the frame and snap the top onto it.  Didn't want to deal with anything complicated and this was great for that.  Seems lightweight but sturdy enough.  Wouldn't try to sit on it or anything but it's good for normal desk activities. Wow! If you don't need something fancy but are instead interested in durability, assembly simplicity and a small \"footprint\", this is the one :) No offense to women but once my girlfriend had it unpackaged (we both have severe mechanical deficiencies) it took her less than 45 seconds to snap it together. Seems sturdy and fits the bill perfectly for a compact computer desk. Highly recommend if you don't need bells and whistles. This is the easiest piece of furniture to put together. For the space I had this fit perfect, and works great to keep my laptop on. It is also nice for when my grandkids come over, they can use it for homework. Was weary when ordering a desk at such a great price that it wouldn't hold up, but this desk is great!  It is super easy to put together and looks great in any space.  It is just a flat piece of \"wood\" so no drawers or anything, but looks exactly like the photo.  No complaints here!  I am happy with my purchase! Wow, quickest and easiest assembly table. This is the type of table I was always looking for, light weight, quick to fold and ready to go. The space is enough if you are a tidy person. I only gave this deal 4 Stars because I don\u2019t think the materials are worth $100. Aside from that, delivery was on time, setup is super easy, and no pieces missing. I just needed something I could fold away for my laptop and this fits the bill. I started working from home after COVID-19 hit and desperately needed a desk to work from. We have a small condo so I needed something fairly compact. This desk worked out perfectly. The assembly was a cinch! All the pieces snap in place but it is still super sturdy. It has enough room for my laptop and extra monitor as well as everything else I need for work. Very happy with my purchase I bought 2 of these to match and sit next to each other up against the wall. One was 28 inches high, the other was 29.5 inches high. Even the texture of the desks was different. The one that is 29.5 inches high is a much higher quality desk. The desk was a gift for my son and it arrived with the boxed damaged and taped up. I had to ask him to open it to make sure it was not damaged, and thank goodness it was not. The desk is very nice and easy to put together. My son liked to desk and it looks great in his room. I would recommend the desk to college students. It is easy to break down and slides under the bed to make room if needed. Good looking, sturdy, lightweight desk. Love it. Like that I can easily fold it up and put away if needed. ", "We wanted a desk wide enough that we could sit beside our son in two separate chairs to help with homework but not so big it ate up his room.  The perfect height, depth, and width.  And a very nice looking color of paint on the legs and wood grain on the top that are classy. Great desk. Got for grad school in a small room. Fits well, has good leg room, enough space for laptop, a textbook, a lamp, and various other small things. Was extremely easy to set up, and is very stable. The black legs and dark wood top looks great and blend into my room very easily. Great for students I was looking forward to an affordable ascetically pleasing work desk. It was easy to assemble and have enough space for my dual monitor and work papers. It is a good deal for the price, just be aware that it may not be able to hold very heavy loads- though, again given the price point, I think it is a good deal. None I LOVE this! It is so sturdy and VERY easy to put together! It is just the size i needed.  The only problem Im having is Id REALLY like to order the table one size smaller than this one i bought, but for some strange reason, it tells me that it cant be shipped to Hawaii. Huh. But the bigger one did! Anyway, if i had room for it Id order the same size. These are WAY better than the pressed wood type. Im NEVER going back to those now... Great price and super easy to setup. Please don\u2019t pay for assembly. You literally just unfold it and snap the top on. That\u2019s it. Awesome purchase... wanted something hung light and easy to put together but not cheap looking. Spot on!! Very happy with my purchase followed up with another to expand my work space. I would highly recommend and best part which I save for last not tools needed to assemble very easy and straightforward! Unfold and snap.. literally!! I am particularly pleased with the ease of assembly.  The desk came in a very manageable box, very light weight, which almost scared me.  After opening, I did not even need to look for tools, nor even the instructions it was so easy and clear. I love this desk. I love that I did not have to assemble it, I love that I can fold it up to move it and I love how it looks in my office. I was somewhat concerned about how sturdy a folding desk would be, but this desk  is very stable and durable. I needed a desk that would not only fit my small space, but looks great. I see clients all day long and I get daily compliments on this desk. I did not add a picture because it looks just as advertised. I paired it with charcoal-colored couch and chairs as well as a black bookcase. Excellent, sturdy desk.  Took less than 5 minutes to put together.  No assembly, no fuss, no frustrating nuts and bolts and pieces with silly little numbers that just don't even piece together.  Two pieces.  Open and snap the desk on.  Look is great, not cheap looking.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but the desk fits my needs for a small space and love it. ", "It\u2019s perfect for my space! I have a small room, and it fits snug in the corner! Super easy assembly, I was surprised how easy it was. Took less than five minutes. If you\u2019re looking for a simple desk for a laptop, this is perfect! It is light too, so while it\u2019s great for basic needs, don\u2019t order if you intend to do rigorous tasks. Exactly as described. Removed from box and put up in 5 minutes. Sturdy. Using it for a study area. Fits my books, small lamp and lap top easily.  I love that in can be easily taken down, folded up and put away if I\u2019m in need of the extra space.  Likely buying another one for my mother in laws room. I was referred to buy this desk in 2019. I did purchase it because I had to work from home and I did not have allot of space to make an office. I liked it so much I purchased my son one for his house and he likes it. I recently referred it to a friend who needs to work from home. And I noticed that the price went up almost 50%. It's a decent desk but its not worth the money they are asking. I only paid 65.00 dollers after tax and shipping. I am sure they're price goudging because of the COVAD and more people are working from home. The desk was nice for a laptop desk, but definitely not for a writing desk which is okay for me because I don\u2019t do much paper/pencil writing. The top was not a smooth surface. It is very bumpy and tries to be textured but it feels like a very cheap, plastic-like texture. However, using it as a laptop desk is perfect. I love this desk I purchased it for a study space (I'm a college student living at home) I wanted to stop spending money on starbucks to have somewhere to do homework or have to stay on campus to study. It's awesome and you could fit a chair with no back under it as well. Super easy assembly Since I\u2019m somebody that needed a desk to sit at for my online college courses. This desk was very cheap on and effective. Now while putting it together I had some problems because the wood and metal wasn\u2019t lining up with the snaps so I had to bend the metal frame by forcing the wood plank down. Other than that everything is perfect so far. The design of this table couldn't be any easier. It required no tools to set up and was ready to use in mere seconds. It also looks relatively nice for the price. Only couple of things to note are that it doesn't have a lot of support holding up the center, so it does give a little if you put weight on it (though it's still fairly strong), and additionally, I would be careful placing anything hot on it (like a mug with hot coffee/tea) without putting something under that to protect the surface of the table (I have a small mark on the surface of mine in the shape of my coffee mug now. Haha.) -Desk is easy to fold and store away Easy to assemble but the table flexes when your typing which makes my monitor shake which is pretty annoying. The corner of the desk isn\u2019t rounded either so hurts the wrist/ forearms after a while. I\u2019m surprised how sturdy it is even though it\u2019s soo easy to assemble. Usually, set ups like that aren\u2019t built to last but so far it\u2019s still standing strong carrying my computer and as my work desk. ", "Love this product and I\u2019ll be ordering more from this brand. I just wish there was extra support for more weight and based on the design aspect they definitely could\u2019ve run an extra bar on the sides instead of one. Otherwise it would\u2019ve gotten 5 stars. The price is also fair but a bundle deal for buying more than 1 would be ideal. I can\u2019t put anything together. This is literally already assembled and you just click the legs in. Very happy about that. Just a heavy board with legs so on the downside, even at this price it was overpriced in my opinion. I LOVE IT!! My apt is about 600 sq. ft and it fits perfectly in my living room and doesn't take up too much room.  I have a 15 in laptop and 20 in monitor on it and still have enough room for an open binder.  So easy to assemble.  Took less time to put together than to get it out of the box I need a nice size but a small easy to assemble desk due to my physical limitations. All I had to do was open the legs and the snap the top on the top. This desk is so sturdy and it holds a lot of weight (the exact amount listed with desk) And I love the design of the desk especially the top of the desk. So I would definitely recommend buying this desk!!!! this desk is FANTASTIC!  i just moved and needed a desk for a smaller space. the look is great....no assembly required and the desk just looks modern and sleek. I LOVE IT and would buy it again if i needed another one. this is a great desk and i would recommend it to anybody Great desk. Took me less than a minute to put together. In fact I would say it took me more time to get it out of the packaging. Great design. Table top and frame very sturdy. Easy fold out frame and snap on top. It is fine for a smallish room if stored after use.  Desk top must be lifted off frame for folded storage or transport. Frame is lightweight but sturdy. Table top about somewhat heavier. Great computer desk that snaps together very easily.  The color is darker than I expected, but there is also a gray version that I may try instead.  Looks great in a modern style room. The wood top is actually a resin/plastic that  looks realistic and is great for wet beverage glasses. I need to throw a telework gig together and I ordered this a double monitor bundle and a chair for a great price. Just ask a super nice I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more. I have the same set up as if I was at work and it makes me really happy! perfect choice for people who are looking for a smaller room. It easily holds one good size monitor and a laptop and enough space for books. Assembly is just 5 minutes. Very sturdy and solid. Look and feel was very rich. Worth the money. ", "Great desk at a wonderful price- just what I needed for my daughters room- now I want one for my room. Snaps into place. Looks more expensive than it really was! I bought this desk, because it matched a book shelf I had purchased, and I needed something to fit in a small space.  It didn't disappoint.  There no assembly, other than unfolding the frame and popping the top on.  I found a stool that matches it, and completes my desk, bookshelf ensemble!  Perfect!  I love it! Looks great for the price. I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it for a heavy desktop computer set up but it\u2019s perfect for a laptop and general studying. Nice and light and easy to move around. Love that it can be folded up if needed. Easy to assemble, the legs just snap in to the top. Excellent desk! Liked it so much we bought another for our other room. Took 60 seconds to assemble. I absolutely adore this desk! Not only is it incredible for its price, the quality of the materials are very high quality. It was the easiest desk I\u2019ve ever had to assemble (keyword being assemble \u2014 it required no nuts or bolts or screws for us to put in!). Simply take it out of the box, and pop it right open. I love the simplicity of its design. It fits perfectly in my simple and small room. There\u2019s plenty of leg room for a tall person such as myself (5\u20199\u201d!) and I can even fit a small sized cabinet right under it. I\u2019d definitely recommend this to the minimalists! Desk itself seems to be good quality. Extremely easy to put together. The veneer on one edge of the board was cut incorrectly, so I have a line on the edge of the desk that is pretty visible. Have not used yet, so cannot verify sturdiness. absolutely love! Perfect for my teen\u2019s desktop PC. He\u2019s got a small room so this is a great size for the space. Incredibly easy to snap the top onto the base. It\u2019s clean lines, classy appearance, simple, and sturdy. I\u2019m definitely going to purchase again for other uses. The is the perfect desk.  Literally took two snaps and boom assembled! It\u2019s cute and very roomy in the leg region.  A good amount of work space. My only negative thing is that the top is textured so you have to write on a note pad and not just a piece of paper or you will have all the squiggles and lines. This desk is the perfect size for working remote from home. At the end of the week it folds up and can be moved out of the way. This desk was easy to set up (no tools required). Very well made, very easy to assemble and worked perfectly for me. Held computer, keyboard, mouse and flawed scanner easily in space provided. Will be easy to disassemble and store as needed, excellent design. I expect years of service from this desk! ", "We rent a furnished home in Florida during the winter months every year. The home does not have sufficient desk space for my husband and I to manage our small businesses. We purchased two of these desks. They are just perfect for a small computer, monitor, keyboard and a bit of work space. They are light, but sturdy, simple to assemble and look nice in the home. We plan on taking them apart and storing them in our local storage facility when we leave, so that we can reuse them again next year. When dissembled, they will take up very little space in the storage facility. A great little desk and for the price it can't be beat. It fits in a very small space but still has room for a chair and a compact filing cabinet to slide underneath. It took longer to get it out of the box and packaging than it did to set it up. If I have one complaint it is that the surface is textured and if you are writing with a pen or pencil you will need something smooth to back the paper. Easy to put together, no tools needed!  Unfold and push legs, it really is that simple!  I live in an apartment and needed a workstation for my laptop as I work from home.  The desk looks like a piece of furniture - perfect addition.  I love it!!! Highly recommend. Really like these desks, got them today and were super fast to put together. We have enough space for both of our PCs, one of them with 2 monitors as you can see in the picture. The monitor on the left is pretty heavy, but the desk feels sturdy. The only thing I would suggest is maybe getting a desk pad because it scratches easily. Absolutely perfect for my needs. Was worried about flex on the desk as I draw often and lean onto the desk. Much sturdier than I expected, works great. Looks awesome and an absolute breeze to set up. Might grab another for my bedroom, and definitely looking at the bookshelf soon! Desk is perfect. It took me about 2 minutes total to unbox and setup, no instructions required (it's literally 2 pieces). It's the perfect size for laptops while leaving room for other items, and my desk chair fit right under it. No complaints. we Put this desk under a child's loft bed, with her gaming chair & PC. She loves it. It is big enough for a Dell 27\" (Gsync) monitor, a Keyboard, mouse pad ,etc & her laptop too.  as long as it  stays strong & lasts , it is a definite good buy, especially since it was less than $100. I am using this desk as sort of a dressing table. It fulfills its purpose quite well. This desk is almost shockingly easy to put together. You unfold the bottom bars and pop the top on. That\u2019s all. This desk is so awesome that a few days later I bought ANOTHER to put my reptile terrariums on! This desk may look unstable but it is surprisingly strong. I have a heavy sit to stand module on top with my laptop and a 21 inch monitor and it is so sturdy. The beat part about this desk is how easy it was to put together. No tools required and only two parts...the base and the top. Very intuitive so no instructions necessary. Just unfold the base and snap the top on. Love it!!! Well worth the money. ", "Arrived today and I am so disappointed ! Defective. There are only 2 parts to put together. The first part did not sit on the floor straight and it was a little off-balance - first clue. Then the second part had a chip had a tab that was off so it could not be securely put together! Oh well - potential. Returning it and not re-buying it. Thrill is gone. This is by far the easiest piece of furniture I\u2019ve ever had to assemble. Exactly what I needed while working from home. I gave it 4/5 stars because it was a tiny bit wobbly after assembly, but that was easily fixed after placing a tiny bit of the packing cardstock paper underneath one of the legs. You would never even know! I\u2019m definitely happy with this purchase. I used this as an office desk table. It supports the weight of all items (monitor, coffee maker, speakers, keyboard/mouse, etc) with ease. It can support your weight if you lean on it but I wouldn\u2019t sit on it for sure. Very inexpensive but good quality. The only thing I can complain about is the desk pops off at one corner but we just pop it back on. It\u2019s not noticeable when it does but it has held up well with my 7 year old Putting this together requires no tools, and almost no effort, which was awesome. It feels sturdy enough, and has worked well for the simple purpose of having a small workspace at my home. It's got enough space to keep a laptop and printer on it. This really is a great desk for the value.  nice looking and it can be folded up and slid behind something against the wall if necessary.  Very happy with this purchase - was looking for something nice but small for the guest room - this was perfect. Arrived late, slightly damaged and is shorter than I expected - BUT is less than $100, so I guess is ok? Definitely feels and looks like it\u2019s less than $100, so hopefully it just lasts long enough to get through WFH. This is exactly what I was looking for! Something chick, cheap, elegant and big enough for my monitors..! Ugh so happy to finally have a set up for my work needs! Would recommend and would buy again, def! This is an excellent table or desk for small spaces.  It's works perfectly in my temporary home office / spare bedroom.  It's solid enough in the construction that it's not going to wobble as I use it and it doesn't look like a folding table (although it actually does fold up).  I really like the fact that there are other coordinating pieces that I can add when I move into my permanent home office and have more room. So we live in a pretty small house and I wanted a smaller desk for our computer and stuff. This desk is perfect. I could not love it more. Super easy to assemble, took all of 2 minutes to snap it together. It\u2019s obviously not real wood but it\u2019s super durable and very cute. Love love love this desk. If I could give 10 stars I would. ", "I needed a desk for my laptop, and this solved the problem for me. It's smaller than the office desk so I have to keep it clean from the clutter all the time. It is sturdy better than flimsy plastic tables. I like it. Recommend it for students. I love this little desk, which I use as a side desk to hold my printer, automatic stapler, and other office electronic devices.  It could not have been easier to set up and just as easy to move around or put away.  I get lots of compliments on my classroom-based office. This desk is incredibly easy to assemble. It looks great in our small apartment and while it can't hold a lot because of it's small size, it's big enough to serve as the computer work desk that we purchased it for. 5 stars all the way. This is desk is SO EASY to assemble!!!  I gave five stars!  It took me longer to get it out of the box than it did to assemble! My room is incredibly small so I was looking for a desk to fit well in it. It's a pretty good size, nothing really big but it works well. The assembly was incredibly easy, the \"legs\" of the desk just fold in and out and the wood can be taken off for easy transportation. It's a nice quality and it looks good. It\u2019s for a small work area so my wife would be comfortable instead of working from the bed or couch I had to have a computer desk less than 42\" wide when we moved so we discovered this one.  It fits the space fine and is great for my business computer, speakers, etc.  I would recommend it.  It does have a scratch on the top but it's useful so nothing to complain about. So day one of owning this desk but it's exactly what I was looking for! It's light but also sturdy and it's well made! The stain is super cute and not at all cheap looking. It was a breeze to put together and took me about 10 seconds to do it! I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a nice looking, quality office desk that also is decorative! This is a very nice, sturdy, easy desk! I thought it was a little pricey but after receiving it and having the easy of popping it together and knowing I can easily just hide it away or move it so easily, I really thing it is worth it! This desk took longer to remove the two pieces from the box than to put together. Parts fit snugly together to create an incredible and instantly sturdy desk. I have a large laptop, additional monitor screen, keyboard, mouse and paperwork on this desk. It is perfect for the small space I had available. ", "Item looks as it except the corner of the metal frame had chipped paint and the edge of the table on one corner and the sides next to it was slightly scuffed. Box was not damaged so it must've been error in warehouse. Otherwise, it's what I was expecting. I love this desk. I needed something small enough to fit in my room without taking up too much space but big enough to do school work on. This desk is perfect! It is stable, and only took 10 minutes to build. I would recommend to anyone! This desk was unbelievably easy to set up - literally, take it out of the box and unfold it! Yet it doesn't look like a folding desk. My son uses it as a computer desk, study desk, eating desk - for everything, and loves it. It took me longer to take this out of the box than to put it together.  It\u2019s sturdy and has ample surface space for my laptop, external monitor, keyboard, and a small writing area.  I took off one star because the laminate is very easily bruised, not sure what I expected for $100 though.  I would definitely recommend for small spaces. I liked this table so much that I bought two! It comes out of box in two pieces (the top & the metal base). You unfold the base and set the top on and click it down to stabilize it. If you want to fold it up, just \u201cpop\u201d the top off and fold the legs back together. Prob slips right under a bed or in a closet easily! Love this table, price and ease to set up/break down! Needed something small and sleek for my living room. I absolutely love it. Great value, too. Only con is the surface is NOT ideal for writing (grainy texture) unless you layer something underneath whatever you're writing on. Just got this today, it takes 1-2 minutes to set it up. I need a smaller desk for behind my couch, it is perfect! The finish is awesome( they need to make more colors!) I love the ability to fold it up and put it away, the was the deciding factor for me. So convenient!! Chose this product for 2 reasons: size and reviews (about quality and customer service). It arrived quicker than promised and was better than expected for quality (for price). Would now buy another but unavailable for shipping to my area? *Side note: Was careful unpacking to preserve box in case there was a defect and I needed to return. My reviews are all based on why I bought the product and is it what I expected and the answer is yes.  I needed a small no frills table to hold my laptop and 24\" monitor so I could do some work in the house without taking up a ton of room and this table fits the bill perfectly,  It takes (no kidding) 5 minutes to put together looks fine, feels sturdy enough to hold my stuff and the price was right. This is the perfect desk for people who have tight spaces or move frequently. It\u2019s easy to set up and fold down. It\u2019s a good size desk; I can fit 2 monitors. It\u2019s not too big though. The desk fits perfectly in our guest room / office. It\u2019s sturdy and I can write on it. All in all very happy. ", "Wasn't very optimistic about this desk when I ordered it but WOW! I love my desk so much! Needed something sturdy but chic. It literally took 30 seconds to assemble. Such a nice addiction to my small home office! So this desk has a very flimsy top. It does not hold much weight without the desktop curving in the middle. Very disappointed. This is such an amazing desk! It may be small but I\u2019ve been using it to work from home for the past three months and it\u2019s just what I need! I also moved and was able to move it very easily due to the slide in frame of the desktop. I\u2019d recommend this desk for anyone that moves a lot and wants a desk that can fit in almost any space. Love this desk. The wood looks real, and it was the easiest thing to assemble. Highly recommended. I would have given this table 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the fake wood surface is actually textured. If you try to write using a ball-point pen and a piece of paper it either won't work (as the ball does not get rolling) or it looks like you were writing on top of a rock (the lines jump and break). Every time I write I have to put three of four sheets of paper under the piece I'm actually intending to write on. It's too big to return, I don't have the box. What a waste... Just received it.  The initial quality looks great.  The surface is nicely finished and looks like a much more expensive piece.  Assembly is basically nil.  Just snap the desktop on.  Very pleased with this desk.  I may buy another. Very sturdy, yet super easy to assemble. It took me longer to open the package than to put the desk together! Love the wood pattern and color. Surface is slightly rough though, not optimal for writing on a paper on it without a pad or a thick support With an urgent \"work from home\" order from my company I was in desperate need of a desk but in my very small apartment I couldn't justify buying another piece of furniture. Then I found this desk! Perfectly priced for something temporary that I can fold up and put under my bed after all this. But still trendy enough that it doesn't look like it's out of place in my apartment. Now, I would never stand on top of this desk haha but its perfect for day to day work. After moving multiple times with a heavy desk with annoying parts, I love how easy it is to assemble/disassemble this desk. It has a nice modern look. FYI, the desk top is textured. The only downside is that the middle of the desk doesn't handle weight very well. I'm not a very strong person, and I can see the desk giving in a little when i press down on it. I've been treating it gently, so there's no noticeable distortion in the board. Still, I'm always weary about it. Working from home now so a desk was needed. This fit perfectly and was easy to assemble. It's comfortable to work at. Lots of room. Plenty of space for laptop, 2nd monitor and other work supplies. ", "The whole thing feels a little cheap, but it *was* cheap, and super easy to put together. It looks pretty good once it's set up, and given that set up took all of two minutes, I'm quite happy I went with this. Pieces were all perfectly fine--no bad welding, and no chipped desktop. As with others, I started working from home in March. The dining room table wasn't cutting it and we had limited space for an office. This fits perfectly against a wall and has room for my laptop and an additional monitor. Very happy with this purchase. The top is too thin and can't hold much. If you put too much on this desk it sags. I should have returned it when I had the chance. I am in love with my new desk! It\u2019s compact, modern and the finish on the wood is impressive!  It took me longer to open the box than it was snapping all the parts together. Great leg room and sturdy, too!  And the bonus: no assembly tools required! Don\u2019t think twice and buy it! Perfect desk or landing zone for a small apartment. I couldn\u2019t believe how easy setup was. It looks great and feels solid. It\u2019s clearly laminate but doesn\u2019t look like it all. For the price I don\u2019t need to worry about setting drinks on it or scratching it. Plenty of legroom and zero wobbling. I used this desk as a computer desk. I setup 2 dual screens, keyboard, and computer on it.  It came in 2 parts, the wood and the stand. Very easy to assemble. Just unfold the legs and set the wood table on top. Looks very nice and I love the color of the wood as well. Update in 2020: Awesome desk for the price. It was easy to assemble and seems like it will be easy to fold and store if I ever want to. I\u2019m also a big fan of how deep it is without being too long. I got two of these for my new apartment. They came in compact boxes that were relatively easy to handle. The assembly was virtually non existent. You just stood up the legs and then lined up the desk top and pushed it into place. They both look great and are doing what they need to do. Daughter was furloughed and later asked to return and work from home indefinitely. Desk is perfect and works well for her office setup. Great price and put together in less than one minute. ", "I bought a study table from another store and it was hard to assemble and also very expensive and it broke the next day. So I looked on Amazon and this is the cheapest and affordable table on Amazon. Plenty of legroom, Easy to assemble. I would recommend this to everyone. I have a desk top computer and this was just the right size for that, plus extra room still for any desk items you might want to add.  It was easy to assemble and its very sturdy.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice table for your office/computer work.  Price was just perfect too. I wish I would have bought it sooner. This table was cheaper a few weeks back and I kept waiting not sure, if I really wanted it but now that I have I love it. It was perfect for what I needed. I use it as a \"fake\" kitchen table or desk for photos! One leg is slightly shorter, so it makes the desk wobbly. Unfortunately, I had already thrown the box away and couldn't return it. Since it is one piece and just needed to be unfolded, I thought it was safe to discard the oversized box. From now on I am keeping all boxes until I use big items. At first Amazon offered a 30% credit, but another rep wouldn't honor the offer. Poorly made product and poor customer service from Amazon. This is a great desk in regard to assembling and overall quality. I will however warn that it is NOT meant for heavy things such as larger desktops or anything heavy in general. I have a 15 inch macbook pro laptop and even this computer is making the table/desk top warp just a tad. Overall pleased with what I had paid for. I love this Covas furniture. I had an empty bedroom and decided to make it an office. I'm 62 and have never put anything together. I found this on Amazon along with a table and bookcase. You literally open it up and place the wooden top on it and push to snap it into place. It is really nice looking. It is a brown board with a grayish wash. Goes with modern, farmhouse and any casual style. The perfect simple desk for my at home office. I purchased two to make an L shaped workspace not knowing that Coavas also sells a corner L shaped desk. You wont be disappointed. Set up is a breeze. No screws or tools needed. Awesome little desk, small enough to use anywhere but big enough to sit my employee at with a work station and when needed it folds up 0 tools required to put together I needed a tiny desk to fit in a tiny space and this was perfect! Just enough room for my laptop, mouse, and a small space for notebooks, etc for taking notes/doing homework.  Super easy to assemble, surprisingly sturdy, and exactly what I needed, plus it was SUPER cheap! So easy to put together!!! Wood is laminate but it looks very durable. Shipping did take longer than it said but with what\u2019s going on in the world I understand. It is small but not too small, perfect for my studio apartment ", "Overall, it's a pretty nice desk and it's relatively affordable.  But it looks like the top was messed up during manufacturing because it won't fit together no matter how hard I try.  It's almost like the top is 1/4 inch too long.  And so I currently have one side snapped in and the other side is just resting on the top of the frame, making the whole desk sloped. Love this desk for the price! Really cute and meant for smaller spaces and I definitely think this desk will last a while. Although it is small, I have enough room on it to set my laptop, iPad, and a few other things comfortably. The surface of the desk is more rough than a regular desk so keep that in mind if you need to be handwriting things on paper. This doesn't bother me because I just put a binder under my paper if needed! This desk is absolutely perfect for my new-found work from home station during Spring/Summer 2020. The reason I\u2019m not giving a full 5 stars is the fact the top of my desk had a 4 inch long deep scratch when I opened the packaging for the table top. Deeply disappointing but I don\u2019t have time to send it back. It's a good value and easy to assemble. A little low to the floor for me,  but usable. Good for something that is going to be moved. I banged my knee on this and then when I stood up to teach the desk a lesson I banged my crotch on it. I got this for my daughter's small room. She doubles it as a vanity and student desk. My husband was skeptical when I ordered it telling me it looked cheap. Even he had to admit when we put it up that it was very sturdy and worth the money. Don't hesitate about ordering this. Very good for the money. The \"wood\" desk part is very thin and bends a little if you put a good amount of things on the desk. I stuck a piece of wood between the frame and the middle of the underside of the desk part to support it a little more and that helps Fantastic for the price. Light, simple, sturdy. Absurdly easy to set up. I love everything about this desk. It\u2019s visually attractive. It\u2019s super easy to assemble. It took less than 5 minutes to open the shipping box and set it up. And I really enjoy the fact that I can fold it back up and stash it behind the couch when I\u2019m not using it. I like this desk a lot with one exception. There\u2019s a bit too much flex in the writing surface when you put weight on it. It does sag about 1/3\u201d in the center when you lean forward to write on it. ", "Very sturdy little desk and looks nice, especially for the price. It literally took longer for me to take the desk and stand out of the packaging than to set it up in our spare bedroom. One of those items that actually meets expectations! I should I have checked the details of the desk but note that the top wood-looking part is some form of PLASTIC. While it is a very durable material I imagine and actually quite aesthetically pleasing, it is a bit rough on the forearms while I am typing this. So easy to just put together - no assembly required. Nice design, looks great and very lightweight. Can be easily moved around as is or folded up. This is an awesome desk.  Price is a bit on the expensive side but worth it for the convenience, features and quality. Very easy to assemble, would say it is slightly small for a computer desk. I just want to mention that when I put a hot clay pot on the desk, its surface was broken, but I don't see any warning about that when I bought the product. This proved to be a perfect side table for our small study where we have a main desk that my husband and I were sharing, but not conveniently. I needed a small additional table for a small space to work at, and this little table was the perfect fit at a very good price. It is stable and assembled easily. Exactly what I needed. Had a small space for my desk and this fits. Looks good enough for the wife to accept it and is a good height for my keyboard. Supports my laptop, keyboard, two 24 in flat screen monitors, and my echo show no problem. So happy I bought this desk! I had a writing desk forever that was wobbly and clunky, this one is smooth and stylish. When I have guests over it will be easy to pack away. Assembly was a no brainer. 5 stars for great price, simplicity and ease of putting it together. Wish there wete lots more shelf options made like this desk! Also wish there were more color options. This desk is a great add to a small condo. Note: not sturdy enough for super heavy items. But really a steal! Happy customer. Don't know if anybody else experienced this, but my elbow resting on the table got a terrible skin rash. Beware of buying this item in case you have sensitive skin. Took son and I less than 15min to put together. So easy! No tools required. It feels sturdy and looks nice. Priced right. 100% recommend for basic computer use, school work, etc. ", "I love this desk. You can assemble it in less than a minute (yes, a literal real time minute) and it\u2019s supportive of my bulky desktop pc and accessories. It is a little shallow if you are tall like myself (I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d), but this was easily fixed for me by just pulling it slightly away from the wall. This desk was easy to assemble, easy to move, fits in the small space for my office without issue. The top of the desk isn't as smooth as I wanted, it's textured but not enough to get in the way with my writing. Cute desk! It was easy to put together and it\u2019s great quality for the price! This was by far the easiest desk I have EVER put together. Literally unfold and snap together. Sturdy. Very affordable. I use it daily. Laptop/extra monitor and keyboard fit nicely. Matches my home decor. I may order another for my bedroom! The desk is solid, assembles in a snap, literally.  In the photos it appeared the tabletop was attached to the frame and merely needed to be lifted and snapped. In reality, it's a separate piece, but, still merely snaps easily onto rails on the frame.  The whole thing took literally seconds to assemble.  Seems solid for its mass.  Enjoying it. Bought this for my son\u2019s bedroom. It\u2019s perfect for a laptop. Does not have a lot of room for knickknacks. It\u2019s a basic writing desk. The best part is that there is no assembly. You literally unfold the base and put the top on. Product came damaged. Extremely cheaply made. It\u2019s just some plastic wrapped wood. It is literally two pieces. The \u201cwood\u201d and metal. It snaps in. There\u2019s cross bar so you can put anything remotely heavy on it. Style is nice. Sad I was looking forward to the desk because of its looks. This desk is perfect for my needs. I didnt need anything big or permanent. I needed a study area that could fit my laptop and 5 large course books. It has enough room for all with enough room to have two books open at once. I love that I can fold it up and store when I finish my course and possibly use it as a side table for the living room. I was pleasantly surprised by this desk. It was easy to assemble, compact, and it seems sturdy. So far the top surface is holding up to general light use. This desk is only for working from a vacation home during the pandemic so it won't see much use after that. This desk is good quality, lightweight and very easy to assemble. Highly recommend. ", "Surface area holds a laptop and additional monitor. Easy to transport in a standard-sized sedan when unassembled. Assembles and unassembles quickly. Attractive surface has a wood-grain texture but if you plan to write on it, a pad of paper would be easier to use than single sheets of paper. I like the look of the desk, it's incredibly easy to assemble and feels sturdy. The only dislike is the surface of the desk; it's a bit rough/ripple & unless you're writing on top of a book or something, it messes up your handwriting. Sturdy and feels like quality materials. Looks great and super easy to assemble right out of the box. Wanted something to match my industrial / rustic look and this fits the d\u00e9cor.  Was the easiest thing I've ever assembled.  Light weight and doesn't take up a lot of room.  Would definitely purchase again. Great for the price. Love the color and it was so easy to assemble. The only thing to note is that it is not super sturdy. I wouldn't put anything over 50 lbs on it. I use it for my computer monitor and laptop so it's great for what I need. Would recommend! Extremely easy to put together\u2014 looks great & very sturdy! Bought another to match. Satisfied customer. You get what you pay for, but if that's true, this is way over priced. I agree it's really cute -- but it's not functional. It sags and bounces with even the slightest pressure, and mine also showed up warped. Very easy to assemble basically jst snap it place I love this little small desk is so convenient just the right size for my family room.  Doesn't take up a lot of space it's good quality I just got it today so I'm looking forward to working on it while I'm teleworking during the covid-19 unfortunate situation. Bought this desk for working from home. Very easy to move from room to room when needed. Folds and stores easily as well, no tools needed. Pretty sturdy, would recommend for monitor, laptops, drawing, printer etc. Might be a little lightweight for computer tower. ", "I moved into a different office with a much smaller desk. This table fits perfectly beside that small desk and gives me some much needed room. I do wish the surface was a little smoother, this table isn't suitable for writing on without using a blotter or other smooth backing. Easy to set up and works great. A good item for the price. (We painted ours white to match decor) I needed a desk for me to work at until I move in with my significant other. I spent a lot of time looking at different desks and decided ultimately on this one. I thought we'd both have to put it together but, while he was off at a game night, I decided to bring my all-in-one screwdriver to put it together myself. I was surprised when I realized all I had to do was unfold the legs/frame and snap the top in. Awesome! The size is perfect. My only concern is how wobbly it is, but for the price I'm glad with what I have. It's not as stable as my wooden desk in my apartment, but it's been great to work with the last few weeks (and until the summer). You get what you pay for. It's very light weight I would not recommend putting anything super heavy on it. I use it for my home office. I can fit a monitor,laptop, keyboard, mouse, and have some space. Doesnt take up much room and looks nice. I bought this table to use as my sewing table.  It was reasonably priced, sturdy and gives lots of chair and/or leg room.  Easy to assemble, looks nice.  If I didn't need this as a sewing table, I could use it just about any where.  Good find! The desk is stylish, super easy to assemble and take apart, and light. The only concern is that when I have a lot of stuff on it and when I rest my hand on it, the top bends a little. Definitely monitor the weight limit. If it's for studying or putting knick knacks on top it should be okay, just keep in mind that it's not heavy duty. I recently got married and we needed a second desk in our new apartment since my husband and I would both be working from home. I did some searching and came across this desk -- looked nice and easy to assemble (aka hardly any assembly required). So, we purchased it and we are more than satisfied!

I needed a desk immediately kept it, but again, the top came basically destroyed. I ended up covering the top with contact paper. ", "I like the desighn the the top is a huge weak point. They could fix it by adding a little angle iron piece to the front of the lip. I ended up replacing the top all together with a birch top from the hardware store. I am really happy with this table.  I use it for a computer desk.  More than enough room for two monitors and a keyboard or to use with a laptop.  Extremely easy to put together it takes 5 min.  Simple but very nice design and the size is great for me. I wanted a functional table for using a computer, writing, or gaming without a giant desk I really like this table. It was so easy to set up.  I\u2019m not using it for computer but instead a sewing table. It fit perfectly along the small wall of the room. This was so easy to put together and perfect for just use of my laptop, taking some notes, and working on paperwork.  Spacious enough and great for a small space at my parents.  Would buy another This is the perfect little desk! It looks nice, literally just snapped together for set up, is sturdy enough, a perfect size, and a great price! It arrived in great shape as well! I definitely recommend this desk! It is easy to put together. I bought four of them. Highly recommend if you are looking for a reasonable price desk. The desk is so flimsy .I thought it'd be more like the reviews said it was.its tiny ..so cheaply made .I was so disappointed Bought this to add to the side of my bed - wanted something a little bigger than a nightstand that I could add a chair to and this is perfect. And literally the easiest thing in the world to assemble! It just snaps together but doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. I wouldn't do jumping jacks on it or anything but it is perfect for what I needed. This desk is exactly what I wanted and needed. It takes up minimal space, but most importantly, it was incredibly simple to pop into place and is nice and sturdy. It arrived very securely packaged. The only remotely negative thing is that the slightly textured desk surface makes handwriting a bit bumpy. This hasn't been a real concern for me. I ordered this in a bind as I had to start working from home. Quick delivery, setup was a breeze, and it's the perfect size for my crammed little space in a bedroom. Most importantly, just enough space for a mouse, laptop, and a second screen so I can work effectively from home during this Covid-19 crisis. ", "This desk took me about 7 minutes to assemble never did I think that would be possible!! Very happy with this purchase and convenient for people who move around a lot. I gave this five stars which I believe it earns. I am using it as a credenza in a loft office. It looks great from the lower level, took no assembly, and holds things like, well, a flat surface does. It is about 2 inches taller than my regular desk so the sliding of piles would be best served with a little ramp so I have to actually pick up things and move them. That sort of sounds like my problem and not the desk. Next purchase... Marie Kondo. The desk, despite being just the perfect size, having an easy assembly and small form factor for stowaway, was too wobbly for my intended use as a writing desk. And aesthetically, I found it 'meh' but then again, a matter of opinion. The company was cooperative in the returns and my refund was issued in a week. Exactly what I needed, a lightweight desk for studying. I love that I can fold and store as needed. The rustic wood-like finish is a nice touch. In case this helps, I will add that the table top is not a smooth finish. So, if you are doing any type of handwriting you will need something underneath the paper because it has a textured finish. I liked this thing so much for my daughter, that I also got one for myself. I use it as a computer desk and so does my daughter. Very easy to put together. The top snaps onto the base. NO HARDWARE. Takes longer to get out of the box than it does to put together and have ready to act like a respectable table. Easiest table i've ever assembled. Thought I would need to spend time, but this table was engineered to literally pop out, then bing bam boom its a table. Not great for writing on. Need something hard underneath ur paper. Just for placing a laptop on, you're good. Cross wires that are supporting desk prevent ur legs from going all the way under, can feel a little bit straining if u can't sprawl out have to get around it by adjusting seat height and whatnot.

Is kinda of small but gets the job done, i want something to write on and do some hobbies, the only bad thing i could say about it is that it really looks cheap, but if you dont care about the looks and just about how useful it is, then go for it ", "This table works perfectly as my desk for work or schoolwork. It is higher than I expected, but I am only about 5 ft. I have not experienced any trouble writing on the surface of the desk but I usually write in notebooks anyway.

My son had been wanting a desk for a small area of his room but I couldn\u2019t find one small enough, stylish, or affordable until I came across this desk. It fit perfectly. He took it out of the box and it must have already been assembled because he has it up in minutes and he loves it. Just what we were looking for. We needed a small desk for the corner of our nursery. It fits the space well. My only complaint is that I thought the top would be wood, but it's more of a plastic-y material. You get what you pay for though. Would buy again. The desktop is an extremely cheap, weak material. It is not sturdy at all and due to the design of the the desk, there is no support for such a weak material. Very disappointed in the product Unfold the frame, snap on the top, and you're ready to roll.  Big enough to hold a laptop and monitor.  Sturdy.  It's not \"fine furniture\" but the quality for the price is excellent. Awesome Great height, plenty solid, good depth, it looks nice. I wasn't expecting great things from a cheap table but it's exactly and more than what you expect. The only issue I have with this table after using it for about a year now, is that the edge material begins to peal away from the table due to normal use (laptop table). I am so happy with this buy. Literally took 5 mins to assemble. Took longer getting it out the box. Sturdy. Holds my two monitors, keyboard and work phone with enough room for a few things. Fits perfectly in corner of my bedroom. It was light enough I carried it upstairs. I really can not believe how easy it was to put together! I love it It's not small but folds up super small. I have a tiny office, I can fold it up and put behind my door. ", "Plenty of leg room and desk surface, yet still fits pretty well just about anywhere you have a few feet of free space. Plus, it snaps together in seconds! Everything about it is perfect. Great desk for the price. But if you plan to stare at big monitor for a loooong time, the desk maybe a little small that big screen is a little too close to your eyes. Laptop is a good distance. Took less than 5 minutes to set it up. Ample room for a monitor, lamp, and whatever else you might want to put on a desk, though i wouldn't put too much weight on it. Pretty tall so if you've got a short computer chair you'll find yourself uncomfortable during prolonged computer use. Good price for what you get. I love these desks and now own three.

I was happy with the one I bought in January (same product and seller) and decided to buy another in July. Easy to setup, holds weight, etc. as others have reiterated before. It\u2019s a decent table but you can not put too much weight in front of the table. I think it needs metal support underneath. It saggy when you lean your elbow or even put books on it. Not sure how long will it last. This desk is over priced for what you get .... the desk is big enough , and the legs are sturdy for sure. But the shelf is cheaply made ... it just has some ridiculous sticky paper. I got this thing for my bf otherwise my IKEA $40 desk offers better value. This desk is even better than I expected. I love it. I keep mine folded n behind a door which works great, but would easily go under a bed etc. Assembles super easy, and it's sturdy-very sturdy. Great product will likely purchase more. Easy to assemble and break down. The wood material might not hold up well to wear and tear long term, but you get what you pay for. ", "Ready to use in less than 5 minutes.  All you have to do is unfold and snap. Durable, light weight but sturdy and looks great! I highly recommend it.  Purchased it during stay at home orders and it made working from home so much more manageable.  I plan to buy one for my classroom when I return to school. This desk/table is pretty good. It came a day early. Nothing was damaged! The top and the base are two separate pieces. You take the base out and open it up. Then once it's open with the back and two sides you place the wood on top. You line up the clips on the wood piece to the bar piece on the base. It is definitely foldable when you take the top off. Pretty sturdy. I felt like it could of been a lower price but overall all is good. This table is better than I expected. It is very sturdy\u2014 not wobbly at all.  And really nothing to assemble. This desk came packaged carefully, which I appreciate. It took just a few seconds to put together: just open the base and pop on the top, and Boom! All done! It looks perfect with my contemporary decor. The \u201cwood\u201d top is tough and durable, but it really looks likewiod. I am so pleased with this purchase! I can use it in so many purpose. Right now it is my working desk. But it's so nice and can be use as the decor as well. Love it Perfect for a quick and easy but a quality at home work/school desk! It's not wood first off, secondly it bends when two small monitors and a cup are on top. The vinyl wood pattern was torn when I received it. Not a high quality item. Very easy to assemble. The table top is like a plastic material so I don\u2019t have to worry if my child places cold drinks on it The cutest modern desk/table I have.  I really love this desk first and foremost it was extremely easy to assemble, it\u2019s sturdy, and lastly it\u2019s versatile. Glad I made this purchase Took longer to open box than to put together. Really sturdy but not  a work bench and not for holding all your picnic supplies. Just be reasonable and not put heavy weight on it. Highly recommend as desk for laptop, lamp and a few books. ", "Do not buy this desk unless you want to waste $70 or go through the hastle of returning it. Brought a monitor for my new gaming PC and this fits the bill. It also holds he keyboard and mouse when not in use. It folds up and can be put away as well. I plan on using it as a table for get-togethers as well received it after 3 weeks from ordering and I got so disappointed after receiving it. It is so easy to assemble but it does not even fit right! The plastic hooks in the bottom does not align with the metal I have go remove the screws and redo it in the right place and on the other side there's a gap between the frame and the table top which is bigger from one side than the other. Easiest assembly ever. 1. Open the box. 2. Snap the pieces together. 3. Move to the right spot. Couldn\u2019t be easier. We bought two of these, one for each of our children. Doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space, nice design and profile, and super cheap. Can\u2019t go wrong. This desk is perfect for my need and easy to install.  Only issue is that the table surface has noticeable flaws/dings. A little unfortunate but not the end of the world.  You get what you pay for. Perfect price, unbelievably easy to assemble (I took longer getting it out of the box than I did putting it together). It doesn\u2019t look cheap by any means. Simple, cute, great price. 10/10 happy!! Get this! This desk was extremely simple to set up. Very compact and has a good look to it. One thing to note, the table top seems a little cheap as if it's covered in paper. Be careful as it seems as if it will scratch/tear easily. Overall, I think this is a great desk. I've owned it for a year now and it is still in the same shape as when I bought it. Still looks great, very modern and stylish.  Easy to put together and take apart as needed, but when assembled, very sturdy. It looks great with my black leather office chair. Son-in-law assembled and liked it so much for his \u201cvirtual\u201d work At my Condo over the holidays that my daughter ordered one for her home instead of getting a card table. Incredible desk and great size! Big enough for two monitors if you are a gamer. Plenty of room for a desk chair underneath and a tower! ", "This desk is amazing. I've had it for a week now and I am so happy with my purchase. After spednig $50 on desks which broke during set up, I was looking for something with easier setup. This desk was just that. Just snap into place, and it's done. There are a lot of other desks on amazon for about $10 cheaper, don't waste your time with assembly, spend the extra $10 for this desk, and you'll get a sturdier, better looking desk. Also fits very well in my small apartment. This desk takes minutes to set up from in the box to finish. It looks nice and has an okay feel to it. This is the best desk ever. Strong, great looking, kinda fancy. My room is small, so I thought this might work, and fit perfect. Too easy to assemble. Great desk! Recommend 100% This table is next level in assembling, gosh it\u2019s so easy, getting it out of the box took longer than getting it set up; looks great, sturdy, great value and super cute Great Computer Desk for My Needs.  The Desk is a Good height for Me to Sit up Straight and feel Comfortable doing My work.  Mostly Entertainment I Listen Music and My Speakers Have Plenty of Room I have Some Some USB Peripherals set up up It all Fits on this computer Desk.  Good product i am a Happy Customer. This has probably been the easy purchase I\u2019ve ever had to put together. Was done in less than 5 minutes. Very sturdy. Love the industrial look. Matches perfectly with a shelving unit in my bedroom. Great for smaller spaces. Small, but exactly what I needed for right now. This desk is great for small spaces and is best for someone using less equipment than I have (laptop or single monitor desktop). I knew the desk would be cramped with all the hardware I use, so no complaints here! I got exactly what I expected for the price. I use this as a computer desk and I love it really. Looks clean and well put together. Also love the fact that it took a whopping 30 seconds flat to put together. Buy it. You wont regret it. Bought this as a gift for my brother. The was so easy to assemble! Took maybe 2-3mins to put together if that. The woodwork has a beautiful design, the framing is great and sturdy and doesn\u2019t wobble after a year of installation. I would buy this again! Looks really good in my room, feels sturdy to hold all my books, like the finish on the table and super easy to assemble and disassemble. Only feedback is I wish the legs had a latch for the legs to make it a more sturdy feel and rubber grips at the bottom maybe for hard floors? Although overall it was a very good buy (: ", "This desk gives you plenty of space under it, and the folding design means it will be easy to take with me next time I move. It's very small, but I needed to fit it in a small space so that's fine. The easiest piece of furniture I\u2019ve ever had to put together!!! Only thing I\u2019m not super fond of is how textured the top actually is. Can\u2019t write smooth without something underneath but definitely worth the price and convenience of setup. I would purchase again. I love, love, love this desk. It\u2019s easy to assemble. Easy to move. I love the size. I love the way that the top looks. I love the price. This desk was easy to setup and begin using. No complaints about durability. I didn't pay close enough attention to the desk dimensions, so had to buy a separate stand to fit my 2nd monitor on the same level with my laptop and first monitor. Not the desks fault, though! Well the desk is nice but the clips are not in the right spots. I put it on and did what it said. 3 of the clips broke because they were not put in the proper place to clip in right. Now I have 3 broken clips I'm going to have to fix. This thing is great. I wish all home assembly products were this easy to put together. It looks good, especially from a distance. Up close, the wood looks and feels a little more plasticky, which is a positive when you realize you've left a previously cold drink sitting on top of it. I was skeptical about it at first. After watching the images on Amazon I thought the deflection of the desktop on the front center would be a turn down, however the desktop is firmer than I thought it would be, it does deflect but very little if it has only reasonable weight you will be just fine. I tend to put the laptop on it and support my arms at the elbows at the unsupported front center of the desktop and it feels alright. Also was skeptical about it arriving without damage since I'm from PR, but it also did arrive undamaged. Great concept and design.  I would have loved to have been able to implement this desk, however my concern was the quality of the laminate top.  I really don't think it would stand-up very well for my needs. If you need an super easy to assemble desk (like <2 minutes), this is the one.  I use it for an AirBnb, but it could be used as a regular laptop desk without a monitor.  Pretty sturdy for being so cheap.  I was impressed overall. Very easy an convenient.  I do recommend buying a extended mouse pad to help resist scratches. The color was a little lighter than I expected but not bad. I still like it. ", "Time will tell whether this desk will hold up over the long run, but for now I couldn't be more pleased. The of the design is definitely a selling point. When you add in the handsome, solidly made top with a simulated barnwood look, it's hard to imagine being able to improve on this product. Easy to install.  It can fit a 27\" monitor, laptop, keyboard and mice all at the same time.  Wont leave other room after that, but it does what I needed and it's sturdy.  Looks good in person as well, I was surprised by the finish. The Top buckles in the middle even with no weight on it, perhaps it's because someone tried to clean it with bleach.  There is an area that was scrubbed with some kind of cleaning product.  I thought I was purchasing a new desk This desk was easy to put together, no problems. Everything came in perfect condition and has a nice design. It\u2019s definitely worth the price !!! It is very useful an convenient. Has sufficient space for laptop  mouse or any documents.  Perfect height and leg room. I propose to buy another and will recommend anyone to buy this product. UPDATE: the company contacted me and offered to replace the desk or give a full refund. They have made good on this promise. Despite my issue, I would recommend the desk knowing they offer good customer service. Absolutely loved this writing desk.  It was so easy to put together and assemble.  Looks great in my room and I highly recommend it. We wanted a computer desk we could out and put away easily and also looked nice.  This is perfect.  It also attractive enough that I could definitely recommend for a more full time job. It\u2019s a nice desk. It is SUPER easy to put together. It\u2019s a little on the shorter side thought. My chair is completely lowered. The height is great and its very sturdy. It can easily hold two monitors with room to spare. Definitely worth the money and the leg room is a major plus even with a full size tower under the desk. ", "It's definitely portable, but doesn't necessarily look like it once setup. It's a nice looking desk in addition to being easily setup where you want. I love this desk! It\u2019s very portable and easy to disassemble and assemble. I\u2019m currently working from home so sometimes I work from my partners house. I can just snap it down and it fits in my car. A little smaller than I expected length wise but perfect otherwise. My boyfriend comes to my apartment and works from home often. He\u2019s a little tech nerd, lol. So ideally, I bought this for him. I put it in my living room and it matches my furniture perfectly. This desk is perfect ! So easy to assemble and no tools need.. Every pieces of furniture should be this easy to put together!! Probably the easiest piece of furniture I have every put together; 5 minutes after delivery, we had it set up with plenty of room for laptop and monitor. This is a great and surprisingly sturdy desk. I assembled it in less than 5 minutes and you just snap the top on. Good quality for the price! Love this desk! I started working remote and needed something quick and functional. The setup was very simple and took about 5 minutes. Fairly spacious and allows for leg room. I\u2019ve bought 2 of these for use in a small  apartment. Very happy with them. They\u2019re not super sturdy so I wouldn\u2019t put anything really heavy on one. But great for everyday use and so easy to put together. Worth the price. It really is exactly what it claims to be. Nothing at all to put together- it\u2019s not even putting together bc it\u2019s already in one piece. It looks good and is light and easy to move if you change your mind. It\u2019s awesome for a few hours of work a week. ", "Love it! I am currently in a really small space for sleeping apposes to the shared living area. Any how it went together super easy, seriously anyone could do it with much ease. It folds away nicely. Assembly was stupid proof and provided enough space for all the goods. Feels sturdy and looks sleek! I recently started a job that requires me to work from home full-time. I live in a small apartment so I was looking for something compact, yet with enough room for my laptop and monitor. This desk was perfect! I was able to comfortably fit it in my space and it has sufficient room for what I need it. The assembly is a breeze and I had it up and in use in no time. Good quality for the price too! I'm sorry, but not happy w/ this desk. It came w/ a corner damaged. More importantly and unfortunately, it doesn't clip into the metal stand correctly. It's very easy to put together. There's no work. But, the build wasn't aligned correctly so I can't snap one side in properly. Disappointed w/ this product. Even at this price point. The photo is as little bit deceiving in my opinion. I'm more than happy to send photos. Not high quality, but not cheap either. Not meant for heavy items imo (just the monitor)  so find a place for you computer if this is what you're using it for. Great purchase overall! So easy to assemble, my granddaughter did it herself. Sturdy, very stylish, great desktop space.  Perfect for college student, or a spot with limited space. Surprisingly sturdy and a esthetically pleasing. We ordered this for my husband to use as a home office for a laptop and large monitor and this is perfect. Looks good, was easy to assemble and doesn't take up much space. WAY more sturdy than I expected. There was a tiny bit of damage, but after contacting the seller they were so quick to give me a partial refund! This desk is beyond light weight and so easy to transport. I am thinking about ordering another one for my other room! I love it! The wood doesn\u2019t look cheap either! This is an extremely easy to set up desk. The legs fold out in the top snaps on. It takes 10 seconds. The picture of the wood it's starting to peel though after about a month of use My daughter needed a desk for her New York apartment so she could work remote. She loves this desk, it's stylish and the size is perfect. Assembly is a breeze. ", "This desk is great!  I love the color of it, and it's so easy to put together, all you have to do is fold out the sides, and pop on the top!!  I love it! Wow, talk about service. There was an issue with one of the table tops and the company sent me a replacement right away. The desk material seems okay for the money, but the manufacturing or QC must be way off. The latches to attach the desktop to the frame just refuse to line up to assemble, and the desktop itself seems too narrow to even fit well into the frame itself. The desk may work with some rebuilding but that defeats the purpose of buying vs building a desk and may cause structural issues. If you're putting anything of value on the desk I'd think twice. This was a last minute purchase to be able to work from home. I needed something compact and easy to put together. This purchase did not disappoint! Assembly was less than 5 minutes and did not require any tools. Its very sturdy. I haven\u2019t found anything I dont like about it! Easiest assembly ever!!! Nice desk for the price.

Easy to set and sturdy. This desk is exactly what I needed for a space right next to my bed in my bedroom.  It took me 5 minutes to put together.  It's surprisingly sturdy and rustic chic. This desk is actually really good for most instances. The only thing that I am not in love with is that the wood is a little thin so the middle is a bit flexible. In all fairness though, I have a monitor and laptop on the desk so there is a bit of weight in the middle pushing it down. Great, great desk. Easy to snap into place. I bought this for my sister to use for school and she absolutely loves it. Definitely wanted a desk that I didn't have to put together so, this was perfect. I bought the desk for something temporary to work on in my room. Even thought it's not too expensive for a desk I expected better construction. The main bar along the bottom broke at the weld after only a few days of having it. I didn't exert force on it or mishandle. Just broke after moving the desk into place. ", "I was looking for a smaller, portable desk and this ended up being perfect! It looks great and assembly was a breeze. All you do is unfold the legs and snap on the top. It\u2019s not the sturdiest desk in the world but it\u2019s a $59 piece of furniture so I\u2019m honestly impressed with the quality for the price. I love it. It was easy to put together and much sturdier than it looks. It's the perfect size for my makeup/vanity along with a mirror and a lamp. Great addition to my bedroom. This was perfect for what I needed! Super cute, way way easy to \"assemble\" (a.k.a. take out of the box and unfold), and a decent amount of workspace. Unfortunately, my fiancee also loved it and took it over with his computer and crap. There may be a fight to the death for ownership of the desk. Fingers crossed that it isn't damaged in the battle Exactly what I was looking for. Minimalist, and I can always add a shelf underneath, or another table if I need more room. Snapped together in seconds, and feels sturdy enough. I\u2019d buy again in a heartbeat. I bought this table on sale for about 60 dollars about a month ago since i needed something mobile that I could just set up. I use it as both my gaming station and a place to rest my arms when I'm watching TV. Pretty soon I'll be moving into a small apartment and I realized that I would need another table, one for my gaming station and one for my TV. This one was still on sale so I picked up a second table without a second thought. Looks simple and easy to install , the table top is very thin, and kinda shaky , it barely fits a laptop and two monitors , no place for keyboard . UPDATE: I was going to buy another one but the price has literally doubled ... :( last time i bought i paid $54 now it\u2019s $100 This desk is everything I could ever imagine. So easy to put together and had rotiron legs! This desk has me doing my homework for school with so much comfort! The desk top finish is nice as well! This table is exactly as described and just what we were looking for.  Super easy to assemble, attractive and can easily be folded up flat when we need to store it! ", "It looks great and was so easy to assemble. Best part is I\u2019ve moved three times with it. I\u2019ve been able to easily move it and fit it into all my apartments. It only took me 5 minutes to bring the box in, carry it upstairs, unpack it and put it together. Very easy, and very sturdy. My 7th grader loves it. It was a much better deal than anything I could find anywhere else. It also is easy to take apart to tuck it in the closet for when cousins come to stay. Perfect for our purposes. This desk worked perfect for me! I currently have a very small room but really needed a desk. I looked around a lot for something attractive and sturdy but also affordable. I\u2019ve had it for about 4 months now and I love it. It\u2019s very good looking and I like the desktop material. Perfect size, it fits a small space but somehow still has a ton of desktop space ever with my huge (old) mac computer. 10/10 I love that this desk snaps together easily and can fold it up easily. Have had it up for 3 months and no complaints. I was debating ordering this desk or going to Ikea to grab a desk, and I'm so stoked I decided to give this a try.  Absolutely perfect, super easy to assemble and store away.  Saved me a trip to Ikea and bolting their desk together.  Totally worth it. Well made, high quality and very easy to set up. Folds up small so that it's easy to store if you need to take it down and put it out of the way. Best quality and price of all small desks that I looked at. This product shipped quickly and was easy to set up. It\u2019s perfect for my apartment when I work from Love it! Just needed a simple desk and this was it! A little overpriced but very cute and soooo easy to put together! Works great for a spare room/craft room.  I can fold it up and put it away when I need to use the bedroom for guests but is sturdy as well for my crafting. Great quality for an inexpensive desk.  It was packaged so well that getting it out of the box took longer than setting it up (which was a breeze)! ", "I have a really old desk that doesn't have much space. This was a great addition to my existing desk! Works great and looks nice too! Absolute perfection! Exactly what we needed for a small space. Makes a perfect gaming desk for my bf. Would definitely purchase again. No damage whatsoever and was packaged very well. Loved this so much I got the company's shelving unit as well. It's a very sturdy and comfortable desk. The easy-assembly is a godsend, especially if you're living somewhere temporarily and may want/need to move down the line and bring it with you. Amazingly sturdy in a sleek and easy to assemble design. Holds my ultrawide monitor perfectly. Using this as my work from home station. I love this beautiful desk! The brown wood is beautiful and the assembly was more than easy. I have a fractured right wrist and I still assembled it easily. The desk is nicely holding up a Mac desktop and plenty of books.

This desk is super easy to assemble and perfect as a laptop desk.  Its sturdy and functional. And I love the modern industrial look. This table was assembled in 2-3 minutes! All you have to do is unfold the legs and snap the top (table top) on. The frame rack comes off very easily and I wonder it is ever welded together. The board is thin and  bends very easily  under pressure. The middle support part does not touch the board and I wonder why it is designed like this. Have to stuff a wooden piece in it  to prevent the board from further bending. So easy to assemble! Took all of 30 seconds. Looks great, nice and compact but the perfect size for a laptop + external monitor and mouse. Enough clearance to add a keyboard tray if needed. Feels durable and looks great!

Be careful dragging a monitor across the surface of the desk. I searched a long time for the perfect desk at a perfect price. This is exactly what  I  needed  for my small place.

I would definitely recommend this desk. Fit in the space I needed perfectly.  Of course I measured, but the desk is very solid, sturdy.  Love the color, blends in nice in a neutral setting.  Allows plenty of leg room while sitting in a chair.  Makes working on the computer much easier! This is a pretty acceptable desk for a college student or teen. It's stylish but the craftsmanship could definitely be better. Considering the price was just raised to $60, I don't think it's 100% worth it. It's not built with real wood and the wood paper is slightly damaged. It definitely looks like it could become worse. I do like how easy it is to move considering I'm a college student, and move frequently. So easy to set up and a very small footprint. I use this for my laptop and for my sewing machine. I wouldn't use this for very heavy objects but this is perfect as a writing desk and collapses nicely and easily when not in use.

Just what I expected and fits in a small area in my bedroom (also blend very well with my bedroom furniture lol). Very sturdy for what I need it for. Happy customer! Love this table! It's easy to assemble and I love that if I need to store it away it doesn't take much space. Perfect for bedrooms or for small places. I like how the table looks. I bought it to work from home during coronavirus. I am happy with my purchase. overall i like the desk, i needed a smaller desk and its black and dark wood design looks nice. about the only downside that matters is, the front bottom part of the desk, is not smooth. for example my shirt will get caught, it doesn't do any damage but i worry about over time. This desk is awesome. Great price. Easy to put together and take apart. Durable. Looks beautiful. Great size. Has enough space for what I need. Highly recommend. Probably the easiest item I've ever had to assemble. Literally open the two sides pieces and pop the top on. I must admit the faux wood desk piece does seem a bit flimsier than I expected, not that it matters a whole lot, only will have a monitor, keyboard, and desk light on (less than 10 lbs. total). All in all its worth the $54. Plus if I ever move, it'll be light work to relocate it. ", "Excellent desk at an awesome price point.  It is the simplest assembly I have ever had in a piece of furniture!  Great for students or traveling professionals like me that move a lot! I've purchased two of these desks over the past year to upgrade my kids' desks. They look even better in person and are very sturdy. Very nice desks especially at this price point. I would definitely recommend! The metal legs seem sturdy. But the board on top is not real wood and is quite flimsy. If I lean on it, it starts to bend. OK for a computer screen and a keyboard, but not much else. It can\u2019t support a lot of weight. A good deal for the price and very easy to assemble. My son LOVES the style of this desk, and I love the fact that it takes up minimal space. It\u2019s a great look, and the work surface is plenty large. The desk collapses and pops back easily without having to be taken apart. A+!! Very sturdy and low profile. Fits my iMac, a lamp, and a few other office materials nicely. I live in a 680 sqft apartment and this works perfectly. Assembly was VERY quick and easy. I needed a desk that I could fold away and store under the bed when not in use. I kept the box with the top cut off and just slide it out when I need it, along with a folding chair.

Simple to \u201cassemble\u201d, lol all you do is snap the legs in place. It\u2019s sturdy and has a good look to it. I have to say for the price this desk comes at it is very nice, and I have to say that there is no trouble when you put it together as the metal folds out and the wooden part clips into place,  it is very spacious as well because I have a lot of school work, cords and etc that just sits on top and I still have room to do stuff, though I do have to say that when wrong it does come out a little bumpy but you can always put a notebook under Used it for my small guest room.  It was a perfect match to my furniture.  Very easy to put together.  It took longer to get it out the box than to put it together.  Easy to dismantle as well.  Sturdy, simple, perfect.

I even used it to hold my Thanksgiving Dinner (long story) ! haha! This is an amazing buy. I know that I will have this table for many years to come Very happy with this purchase (2 desk).  Totally impossible for assembling of a desk to be any EASIER or QUICKER than this, seriously, you really open the frame up and snap desk top on.  Takes seconds!!!  Will be super easy to store away during semester breaks. Easy set up and looks great! Plenty of leg room and gaming style chair easily fits underneath. This is not a desk. It is a flimsy, lightweight table. It\u2019s too low to be a desk. The arms of an office chair bump on it. It\u2019s fine as a table to put your mail on, but I wouldn\u2019t use it for a computer or a lamp. I was concerned when i ordered this. Now that it is set up I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. It was better than expected for the price. Super sturdy and looks great. Very very nice size. I put mine in my room which isn\u2019t huge and it fits perfect. When I lean on it it dips though. Top wood could be more sturdy but I just don\u2019t lean on it. I can put so much on it too, as in two lap tops but I have to be mindful if I want elbow room but like I said I try not to do that much this was extremely easy to assemble and is an overall nice piece of furniture I\u2019m very happy with this purchase This table is actually great.

", "If you are looking for a vanilla desk for small places loom no further. I installed some under desk cable organizer along with this and it fits my needs. No tools. It snaps together. The clips are on the piece of wood. Looks very sleek. The hardest part is unpacking it. It has foam protection all around the small desk. I bought two of the table. Design is pretty and simple, but there are some major flaws with the installation. The rubber grommets underneath the table did not match with the leg so I had to drill new holes myself to match the grommets with the leg. Second was kinda crooked but the grommets matched with the leg. If you want to buy the table, you may have the drill some holes yourself. I picked this desk out because it was simple yet stylish.  I was a little worried because it is super inexpensive.  However, this desk is really nice looking and pretty darn sturdy.  It's also affordable for nearly anyone.

Perfect size for his room. No assembly. Sturdy. Did I mention there was NO ASSEMBLY!! \ud83d\ude03 Would buy again, easy to put together and can be folded up & stored away when not being used. For how much the desks cost, it is sturdy and well constructed. Very beautiful piece. I will say this desk is more laptop friendly as opposed to having a computer monitor up there. If you have a large computer monitor (21\u201d and up), take a look at something slightly larger as the computer will hog space and leave limited space to use the desk. I highly recommend this product This desk is everything I wanted to fit my small space. Plenty of legroom, plenty of space for my laptop, additional screen, keyboard and mouse. Ridiculously easy to put together!@ ", "Small space? This is such a smart buy for me... it barely costs $59, but it has worked like $100 table. Its simple and plain, but classy and very sturdy.

Great if you're moving frequently, because it's easy to assemble and disassemble and small enough to pack easily.  Looks nice, clean, and minimalisic, which I like. Less than the Staples brand alternative; glad I checked out Amazon before purchasing the larger, more pricey counterpart. Simple, basic, and nice looking.  My son loves it! It took me less than five minutes to set up!!! Easy to assemble, fits great in my small room and perfect leg room. Amazon did this one correctly. Simple to set up. Great height as well. My boyfriend is 6'4\" and he can sit at the desk without killing his knees. It looks great. I purchased another because the it goes so well with the decor! Functional, practical, affordable, and appealing! SO easy to put together. Good quality, shipped quickly, cheaper than others I\u2019ve found similar, good for small spaces and my large chair still fits tucked under NOTE: Use a coaster for mugs! I now have mug indentations that will never go away... Otherwise, this desk is super reliable. Not too small either. Has enough space for my laptop, notebook, lamp, and a mug. If you want a bigger desk though to place books on top of, this may not be the desk to buy. One of the best purchases I've made!  I love the design and it's perfect for my small home office.

It looks great and fits a laptop easily. There was no damage on the product. This is a perfect little desk.  It was very simple to assemble and perfect for a small lamp and laptop.  It exceeds my expectations. Super easy assembly.  The desk top has small ridges though.  Its not smooth. This is the easiest piece of furniture that I have ever put together...took less than a minute. It\u2019s perfect for a small space and a laptop while having to work from home. The table is nice but the wood is very weak. The table isn\u2019t align with the corners.. it\u2019s not too noticeable but still for this price I excepted something better. Over all I it\u2019s cute looking . Good for decoration Lovely table! Sturdy enough to hold all my office supplies while giving the room enough space to maneuver. Tremendous! Bought this for my cousin to use as a study desk. Works great and is extra sturdy for the price. Giving 4 stars due to some damage from shipping. Also not a completely smooth surface. If writing you will need a pad under the paper. ", "This desk is perfect. Great size for a small room. Nothing to screw. You can literally fold it up and slide it under a bed or put it in a closest when not in use. Plus it looks great! Really the perfect last minute desk for quarantine work from home!  Nice and compact for a small space and love that I have the option to fold and put it away!  Best price too, minus one star because the top is texture and not smooth surface but other than that you will not regret it! Highly recommend We needed a desk that we can set up and take down easily in our bedroom since we're working from home now, and this was perfect.  Not only was the assembly easy but it looks nice.  Couldn't be happier.  The frame is black but it blends well with the brown wood desk...which is what I wanted. Very happy with this purchase. Inexpensive, built well, easy to set up and it looks great. I bought it as a temporary desk for myself but it is made well enough and looks good so it will become my son's when I am done using it. One of the best tables that i have purchased. Very sturdy table and good for office work. If you have multiple monitors, then you may need to get couple of desks and attach them. If it is for use with one monitor it is a perfect fit. I love this product overall. Good desk! It is more stable than I thought it would be. The texture/finish feels very durable. I will probably buy several more of these in the future. Nice desk if you work from home once or twice a week. I fit my laptop, desktop monitor, a notebook, and still have some space for an organizer or something else. Also has a nice wood finish. Thought it was real hardwood but it's just a slim laminate piece that pops into place. Easy installation. Did come with a scratch on the laminate but I covered it up with a plant. So I got this in brown and I use it as a desk for my laptop. I saw some complaints about the height and color and it didn't apply to my situation. I am very happy with my desk. I fold it up when I'm done using it and fold it out when I need to study. Its the perfect solution for my room because I'm living in a small space and being able to fold up the desk after I'm down helps me reduce clutter. The quality of the material is decent, but I bought it for the $60 sale price. I would not be happy with this desk at full price. This desk is great! I put it together very quickly and easily. I placed it in my room along with a new rug and chair. The rug is 3\u20192\u201d x 5\u2019 (38 inches by 60 inches). I will probably buy a separate monitor to add to my desk so that I have both my laptop and the monitor with the bigger screen. The desk has enough space to fit it comfortably. ", "This was the best purchase ever. It is so easy to put up and move room to room. No tools needed. Very easy to put together and fits into a small space! It\u2019s solid construction and looks really nice! This is such a great desk to purchase for small spaces. It\u2019s easy to assemble, not to heavy and uses minimal storage space. It\u2019s nothing to fancy but feels very durable. I recommend this!!! The computer desk arrived on time and in perfect condition (very well packaged). The set up took me all of 3 minutes and that includes unboxing. I\u2019m impressed with the quality for such an inexpensive item! Easy desk. Beautiful color. Love it and it folds up if I am done with it. It's cool. This was super easy to put together came in 2 peices! Good size desk! Easy to assemble and I love the look of it. The only downside is that there is very little support under the desk in the middle . This could cause sagging if items on the desk are too heavy. We love this desk, however the desk isn\u2019t smooth it\u2019s rough and we wanted a smooth desk.  Feels solid and itnaroced with no damage. You get what u pay for, the desk was easy to assemble and only took about 1 minute to setup. It is pretty sturdy but I wouldn\u2019t buy anything like a tv or a heavy monitor on it. I am an average height woman and I find it most comfortable to cross my legs when sitting at a table. This desk provides plenty of legroom without bumping my knee on the underside of the desk. It was also easy to put together, taking less than a couple of minutes and requiring no tools. ", "I love everything about this desk. It's the perfect size for my smaller office space.  The wood is a nice darker brown, slightly greyed color and it feels pretty sturdy.  It was the EASIEST thing to assemble, which was my number one concern as I absolutely hate assmebling anything.  I wish they would make all furniture like this. This desk is so perfect for the small space we had for it.  Assembled in seconds and very sturdy.  Great product! Sturdy, good looking desk! Couldn't be happier. Easy to assemble, looks quality and food small space Perfect size and very sturdy.  Clips were a little off center but still worked with a bit of pressure.  Great for laptops.  Might be a little small for a monitor, base unit and keyboard.  Good value! Unfold and snap together for a sturdy desk that is perfect for your own room or your kids. I started working from home and needed a small computer desk to work at that wouldn't take up too much space. This was the perfect answer to that. The coolest part is the top is easy to take off and the legs fold up if you need to put the desk away. This doesn't cause any weakness in the desk though. The size is perfect to have a Macbook pro + magic keyboard and some additional small space to rest your arms, on the sides, you haev plenty of space for a notebook, speaker or any other thing you want to have. The material looks a bit cheap but is sturdy and light at the same time. Overall is a great product. I love it!  It's a small footprint. Easy to put together. Holds my iMac, MacBook Air and iPad and books. Good sturdy desk, good for small spaces, nice wood top. Decent enough for the price. Arrived to me broken with one of the leg welds completely torn off. Currently being held together with duct tape. But you get what you pay for. ", "Love this desk, I got it for my desktop PC that I got for Christmas. I game a lot and this is perfect for my set up. Its also fairly compact and given that I live in a one bed one bath apartment thats kind of essential for me. It takes up barely any space and still has a ton of room for my very large monitor. Very happy with this purchase. Great desk . I Only wish that the top wooden slab was a bit thicker and sturdy. It is good and not flimsy at all but could be a bit better. I was happy to find this desk but nervous of the quality because it\u2019s very affordable. \u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d... but to my surprise, the items where packaged perfectly and the install was like 20 secs. Sturdy, modern, rustic, and great for our corner bedroom. Very satisfied! I will definitely be looking into making more future purchases from this vendor and recommend this product to everyone! I couldn't believe how smoothly designed this product is - put together in about 30 seconds.  I thought \"that's it?\", but sure enough it's sturdy and looks great.  If the dimensions fit what you're looking, don't hesitate - it's a great desk. This desk is amazing. Easy to put together it is very sturdy. I love the fact that if I need to put it up I can just take off the top and fold in the sides. Its also good for small spaces but gives you enough room and space like a office desk would. This desk is AMAZING. I was expecting to have to screw things in at least but I didn\u2019t have to at all!! It comes in two pieces and it took me less than 10 MINUTES to put together. First perfect in my room and quality is great as well. GREAT buy. Very pleased to say the least :) I love this desk.  I'm actually planning to purchase another one in the future for my daughter.  This desk is portable if need be, it folds up quickly and easily.  It's sturdy, and really aesthetically pleasing.  Totally worth the money! Wonderful small desk fit perfect in the small area we needed it.  I wish all boxed furniture was this easy to put together.  Took longer to take it out of the box than to put together. This product exceeded my expectations in quality. I was in need of a portable office and this does the job perfectly. Not to big, clean wood finish looks better in person. good desk, style, a little on the cheap side.

It looks very expensive and it's very durable. Highly recommend! I bought this 3-tier table as a bedside table. Here's an overview of the most important aspects: I got this as a temporary side table. It definitely did the trick but from up close it looks cheap and only suitable to be placed on a flat surface not carpet as it is super light and not very sturdy. This is a small, short, inexpensive stand...which is exactly what I wanted! It works perfect as a little temporary night stand for my bedroom. I love that you can put the shelves either on the black or white side, depending on what you prefer. I'm happy as a clam with this! I love how easy these were to put together. No screws, no tools, they slap together in under 5 minutes. I did two of them in about 10. This among several other Furinno items I have purchased and I must say I am so pleased with ALL of my purchases.  Easy to assemble (no more than 5 minutes MAX), not cheap looking, and of good quality.  I also purchased 3 of the 5-tier shelving units for my LR to display photographs and am thrilled  Then I purchased this table as a side table in my BR next to my vanity to hold lotions/purfume (one shelf), face cream/cleansers (2nd shelf), and frequently used make-up and hair products (top shelf).  PERFECT!!  I'm considering purchasing another one for the bathroom to hold room freshener, extra roll of paper towels, and my artificial flowers for the top.  So many uses!!  The ability to use either the black or white shelving is a great addition!  Now I am awaiting a new coffee table for my LR which has cute fabric bins for the bottom shelf.  This will match well with the display units.  Furinno has found a dedicated customer.  Highly recommended. Perfect speaker stand! It holds my records, too! And for the price?! Soooo much cheaper than actual speaker stands which I personally don't care for. I'm so super happy with these! They're really stable, not too big, but not too small. Seriously stoked! HIGHLY recommend!!! :D I was looking for a small end table that would be big enough (but not too big) for a Keurig to sit on, and that didn't cost too much. Although the height wasn't tall enough for my liking, I had the idea to buy two, and just add another shelf. I wasn't sure if it would work, but it was worth a shot. They arrived quickly, and with all the correct parts and pieces. Luckily, it was completely possible adding part of a second table to make it taller! You could probably add the whole other table to this, but I didn't need to. It was a breeze to put together, it looks pretty cool, and it's pretty dang sturdy. I'm going to be adding some straps to attach it to the wall to make it more sturdy, but I don't think that it's completely necessary. If you have kids or pets or know somebody who's clumsy, you might either want something else, or need to use furniture straps. Obviously, the taller you make it, the less sturdy it is. Oh, and my Keurig fits perfectly! I'd definitely recommend this. This is a sturdy little shelf/table. I could've put it together with my eyes closed. It took 2 minutes. The description says it doesn't hold that much weight, but I took a shot and put my very heavy water jug on it and had held up fine. No wobbling at all. I am extremely happy with this. I wish these were available when I was young and broke and needing inexpensive furniture. Highly recommend. A little taller than I was expecting, and it\u2019s perfect!! Makes a great side table for my bed and hold a good amount of things. It was so simple to put together, and it\u2019s great material at a cheap price. I have many books on mine, and it\u2019s very sturdy. ", "I ordered this small end table in french oak grey through Amazon Warehouse for a bit of a cheaper price. All pieces and parts were there, there weren't any defects and I put it together in 5 minutes. 6 months ago, I ordered two 'Furrino Simplistic end tables' in the same 'french oak grey' shade, to use as nightstands in my spare bedroom and was pleased with the quality and ease of assembly. So, I ordered this, figuring it was the same as those, just with an extra shelf. It is an inch or two taller, but much smaller width wise. My bad for not checking measurements. No big deal though, because I styled it sideways in my extra rec-room and it fits exactly where I needed it to. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and I do recommend it. It's affordable, but decent quality when you don't want to spend a lot. --I have a 12 pound Himalayan salt lamp on it and it holds it just fine, but that's as much weight as I'd put on it. My bed frame is 12 in high from floor ,on top lays an 8 in\"  mattress and this table is perfect !  small yet roomy. the legs are of very strong plastic ,like a fisher price big wheel ,durable  !!! the shelf is black on one side and white on other ,you choose how to assemble to your choice. These are very cute and easy to assemble. I'm using them for plant stands in my living room and they look good.  I put the top shelf and bottom shelf as white and put the middle shelf as black.  Looks great that way! I bought two of them and may buy a few more soon. I had high hopes for these, the reviews and photos looked good.  I ordered a set of TWO end tables in French Oak Gray.  The set arrived, but they were Americano Black.  I initiated a return, spent about 30 minutes of time and hoped for better results with the next delivery.  My order that was scheduled for a Wednesday, arrived the following Monday.  When it arrived, there was only one table and the second one was missing.  Now Amazon is forcing me to work directly with Furinno, and I can't reach them by phone.  They have yet to respond to my e-mail.  I would like my 2nd table that I paid for please. I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good of quality. It only took 5 minutes to unbox and put together one of the tables. Perfect size. The fake wood look is nicer in person Super easy assembly. Sturdy enough for light loads, great price. Works great for utilizing a small space you thought was lost due to size. Highly recommend! Exactly as described.  Easy to assemble. Material: Engineered particle board, PVC Tubes. Product dimension: 13.4(W)x11.5(D)x22.8(H) Inches with a Rounded edge.  This is a very small and short night stand with not a lot of room on the top shelf or on the other shelves.  Item arrives in packaging that reveals what's inside. To hide it, choose Ship in Amazon packaging at checkout. So, my aoartment is affectionately called the shoebox.  Its tiny.  I don't have a lot of storage space.  So,  I bought one of these initially thinking it's be enough for my bathroom to compensate for lack of shelves.  It was too small.  (The dimensions were off from what they said it was) but it actually for perfectly for the space,  so i bought another and say them together to make wider shelves (They don't sell anything in the black and white the same size) and it was absolutey perfect! They're sturdy,  they don't move around,  they for perfectly in the space provided,  and i love them together. Now,  if the company made a shelving unit the size of the two put together,  that would be the only thing to top what i have. Super simple to assemble.  Unfortunately, the short legs do not screw into the longer legs.  Not sure about the terminology.  But either the screws on all four short legs are too wide or the threads on the long legs are too narrow.  However, the cap screws, meant to go on the top of the short legs (mostly) fit on the long legs.  And, yes, I know that's not where they belong!  So disappointing!  Oh, and the very short feet fit perfectly into the long legs.  I'm not bothering to return this.  I'm just going to use a VERY short table. Nice sturdy good looking table. Not high-end looking but beats the tables made completely of plastic. The legs are plastic but also sturdy. It serves its purpose. I did not have space for a full size night table and this was the slimmer version of something comparable. ", "We were in need for a cheap, effective nightstand for my new home while in quarantine (until we could shop for something a bit nicer). For $10-$15, this is a pretty great deal. This is absolutely not a fancy nightstand, but it gets the job done. Here's my analysis below: I freaking love this end table/ night stands. I got the grey and black. I\u2019ve ordered these joints 3 times. No nails no nothing just plug and twist! OMG!!! They are so cute not too short and not too tall. So I bought this stand to experiment in making a gaming station. I wanted something that would not take up alot of room and was durable. Considering the price on this table and the material I did have doubts. I did not think you could attach dual monitors with a dual monitor arm and have it work. I'm glad I tried as this thing worked perfect for my needs. It takes up very little room, the bottom is just big enough to store 2 gaming systems and you can place the controls on the second shelf. It is an unconventional use for this table but it works great. I hope this review helps if you decide to use this table in a different way as I did. Oh my gosh I love this little bookshelf \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf08 I wish it was a wee bit bigger/wider but other than that it was so easy to assemble. And looks so pretty\u2763 I love the color and it's quite sturdy. I'm ordering another one soon! I had a very small place where a nightstand was needed, and this fit the bill perfectly. It arrived with all its pieces, and no damage or dings. I had it together in a few minutes. Whoever designed the instructions deserves to have their praises shouted from the housetops: Clear pictures, careful step by step instructions, and entirely correct English. (I hope and trust the same would be true for the language of any other country where the product is sold...) I'm back to take a look at their other offerings. Everything besides the product's composition gets a five star for me. Easy to assemble, sturdiness, value for the money. But this table like almost all other processed wood via particle boards, etc. Uses formaldehyde as a bonding agent. This formaldehyde is released as a gas through a process known as off gassing in wherever it's located, even after years. I have confirmed with the company that this table uses 0.09 ppm formaldehyde. Usually, it's 0.05 ppm in standard. Levels from 0.1 to 0.5 ppm has caused observable nasal and eye irritation. But levels from 0.6 to 0.9 ppm has resulted eczema and changes in lung function which is to say lung damage. Which is exactly what the ppm at which this product utilizes. I used this super-affordable \"end table\" in my mom's pantry to elevate a set of stacking vegetable bins off the floor. But it's a sensational solution for many household and office applications. Needed a little nightstand for my boys' small room and their separate gaming area so I though of giving this table a try. Good product for the price.I love this kind of furniture! I love that it's no tools needed and it's much more solid than I expected. You have the option of flipping the shelves so that the white side is more visible.They are very sturdy and one of those fabric bins fit inside to emulate a drawer!  Everything you need will come inside this box and  they we're a breeze to install. This table cones with instructions,  It is definitely not a statement piece, but wouldn't expect it to be at this price point.You can buy several and add together to customize which I am thinking about doing. Kids are loving this table. When I purchased this just a few weeks ago (late May 2019) the price was $13.  Even that is on the pricy side for the sturdiness.  Extremely easy to assemble, but it is cheaply made.  I wouldn't put anything you value on it.  It is also very small and short, which is fine for what it is.  BUT for some reason, they now think that almost $26 is a reasonable price.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!  $26 is a flat-out ripoff for this.  $10 is pretty reasonable for what it is.  $26 is insane. Everything was great right up 'til the very last step, when I went to screw in the top screws that look like caps.  2 of the 4 would not screw in all the way in with just using my hand, which is all you were supposed to use (your hand).. but because plastic screws didnt have a perfect fit, it thus made it impossible to screw 2 of them in all the way with just using my bare hand.  So i had no choice i had to use pliers, which i knew would most likely scrape and mark it up... Yup the pliers slipped a couple times and scaped some paint off and made permanent scuff marks.  So that is why i took off one star.. otherwise great little shelf, sturdy, cute and fits into small spaces!!  Perfect for whst i needed.. ", "Already own 4 furrino twist-n-tube 4-tier shelving units and they have been great. Recently switched from a queen sized bed to a king and there was very limited space, and I didn\u2019t want to spend much more money on a bed side stand. I decided on the small 3-tier unit in white and it is exactly what I wanted. Fits well in a small space and I find these almost fun to assemble. No tools required and I personally just ignore the instructions and piece it together like adult LEGO\u2019s. Not the most sturdy units but that\u2019s expected with the price. Perfect to hold a bedside lamp, phone and charger, and something to drink all in reach! Arrived in one day with a few scuffs and scratches just as the ones before it had. Know getting these that you might get some imperfect looking pieces but once everything is together it doesn\u2019t much matter. I say that as someone who is quite clean and meticulous and is typically bothered by such faults. Proceed with caution! Perfect for my needs. Was searching FOREVER for an end table that would fit UNDER my counter to keep all my daily needs close at hand, but away from the main part of the living room. Fit my needs perfectly. I should have known better to check w/Amazon first. Would have saved me endless searching and lots of frustration. Bought this for my daughter's small bedroom and it works perfectly. Compact with ample shelving which is just what we were looking for. No uneven legs which is common in this kind of furniture. The one minor issue I have with it is the little \"top cap\" covers that go over the leg poles on the top of the night stand don't screw completely down so they there is a little crevice between the cap and the surface. They should make them so they push down rather than screw. Also there was some minor scratches on the edge of the shelves. Still for the money this is an excellent value especially for a child's room where things will get knocked around and you may not want to invest in expensive furniture. This product is very easy to assemble. Honestly, it takes no more than 10 minutes! For the price, it\u2019s a nice three tiered shelf that would fit in a corner or along the wall. It\u2019s not really sturdy, so I would not purchase it if you were planning to place anything heavy on it. I have it in a corner and I have a medium planter with a plant, and two pictures on the bottom shelf. The middle shelf is a little bit smaller, so not much can fit on there. I\u2019m very pleased with the product however, it\u2019s exactly what I needed. One thing to note, it is a white this product is very easy to assemble. Honestly, it takes no more than 10 minutes!

I\u2019m very pleased with the product however, it\u2019s exactly what I needed. One thing to note, it is a white shelfing unit, But I can see no reason why you couldn\u2019t flip the shelves the opposite direction and they could be black, so you could have black shelves with white hardware. Really close to all 5\u2019s. These side tables are great for college kids or really anyone that is on a budget but wants to add a little style to the living room. They serve there purpose, they aren\u2019t anything spectacular. For what they are they are perfect. They have plastic tubing so don\u2019t go crazy with heavy objects. They are a good size and will happily hold a small speaker, a large drinking glass and moderate sized phone with ease. The tiers are great as well. Little short but like by an inch so not a dock able offense. I got the two table box, so these were very inexpensive.  They were pretty easy to put together (although I would recommend starting the assembly with the top shelf instead of the bottom) and were overall what I expected.  I got the french oak one because I have floors in the same pattern and they match almost identically.  They are a little small, but I use them as nightstands so they function well for that purpose (I added a pic of one next to a very standard box fan for size comparison).  There were some very tiny imperfections when they arrived, primarily with the laminate on the edges, but you won't notice it unless you were looking very closely.  They look kind of flimsy, but they're not (no wobbling or anything when you slide them). Overall, they are a decent purchase and if your priority is a low cost, they are perfect!  They're gonna be temporary for me tho.  They look a little cheap and I'd like something a little nicer looking as nightstands in my bedroom. This is a nice little table.  I needed a small and short table to contain a surround speaker.  It had to be about 25 inches tall.  I found this one and first feared it might be flimsy and tip over.  But after I put it together and placed the speaker on top, it seemed very sturdy and tough enough to hold the slightly heavy speaker (about 18 lbs.). UDATE 11/22/2019 I bought a second one for the 2nd women's toilet stall at work. Since the bathroom remodel, each toilet is an enclosed stall, with enough space to put this small shelf for our hand-held items.  We like it so well, I may get two more for the Men's bathroom stalls. I bought this with an idea to use it in a corner of my kitchen that is kind of a lost space. My idea is to put my stand mixer on the bottom shelf, maybe some containers with baking items on the middle shelf, and my food chopper on the top shelf. This would free up space in my cabinets for other things. I don't have a large kitchen so, I'm limited on space to store kitchen items. This would be low profile in my kitchen. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together. I found some of the parts hard to tighten up. They fit snug so but, what I did was I used a rubber round jar opener to get a better grip on the parts and that helped me to tighten them up. It's pretty sturdy once put together and doesn't wobble. It's solid! I am very pleased with it and was thinking I might want one for the laundry room to put detergent bottles and other cleaning supplies on it. It's only around $13 so, it's not going to be like a 100 dollar piece of furniture. For the money and my needs, in my opinion it's worth it and I'm happy with it. :) Nice and cheap side tables. I bought the Americano / Black set. They are exactly as pictured. Three 'shelves' made of some type of composite wood and plastic legs / spanners. I followed the instructions when building the first one but when I got to the last step where you screw down the top cap pieces found that it was hard to get a grip to actually tighten them down all the way. One of them was fine and  had no issue screwing all the way down but the other three were too tight once I got them down so far that I had to carefully use a pair of channel locks to get them all the way screwed in. So I went backwards starting with the last step on the second one and it was way easier. If you get it you will see what I mean. They are not going to win any awards for being great pieces of artistic furniture but they do their job. ", "Just delivered, just opened and Cracked on two separate shelves. Having to shelter in place at my kids home that their remodeling. I have two rickety chairs and an air mattress. Because I travel nonstop for a living I have no real furniture. I needed a night stand and this is better than a tv tray table; not by much. The table has molded plastic for legs/spacers that is oddly shaped and has a lot of rough edges. Use an old fingernail file to smooth it or else you won't be able to screw it together. The plastic trim around the edges of the wood shelfs is also a bit off so I took my nail-file, a black magic marker for the black side to fill in the color gaps and white out to fill in the white on the flip side. Once together it seems reasonably sturdy for a small load. My regular sized iPad fits on a shelf with little else. It serves its purpose and can go into my storage when this is over and I'm on the road again. One table assembled very easily...when they say \"No Tools\" they really mean it!  However, when I got to the 2nd table it wouldn't assemble properly (some of the plastic tubes weren't cut correctly) so it is very wobbly.  Very good value, but I definitely wouldn't want these in a home with cats or kids.  For what they are, they look pretty good. I paid less than $15 for this and I feel I got my money's worth. It was very easy to assemble, no fiddly little dowels like the other nightstand I bought from this manufacturer, and overall a decent little nightstand. I bought this to help organize and so that I would have a place to put things like my lamp, pictures, drinks and mouse without everything getting pushed off by inadvertent moving of my laptop. The shelves aren't big but are helpful for organizing, especially if you put baskets or boxes that are easily pulled out to access small items. Perfect small table between my bed and night stand. Placed my humidifier on it. Hides the cords I have behind the wall too. Easy to assemble! I\u2019ll be ordering more tables! Positive Remarks: I would have given this a 5 star review, but the instructions are backwards... They have you start with the legs on the bottom rather, so by the time you try to put the top on you have nothing to hold onto because the plastic screws have a smooth flat flush top! If you start from the top and work down instead, then at the end you have the little legs to hold onto and screw in. So rebuilding it was not fun. But otherwise it does exactly what we needed! I didn't expect something super high quality - plastic legs - laminated particle board surfaces.  I like the size, and the shelf levels.  I was surprised, however, that it was pretty dinged up coming out of the box.  I'm confident it wasn't a shipping issue because the box was in good shape, and I believe it was the middle packed shelf that had the stress break on one of the corners.  Dings along the edges of other shelves. Soo I did wat I always do, impulse Amazon shop at 4am with under $30 on my card and endless ideas of stuff to buy. And of course I didn't check assembly or manufacturing...it's cute. So I ordered. THANK YOU FOR NO TOOLS NEEDED! I had no clue an was pleasantly surprised wen I half looked at the instructions that it didn't need tools an everything literally twist into a hole. I now have a cool stand to put all my online school notebooks while I procrastinate an watch Hulu instead... Like right now. Awesome product, buying the set soon...see u at 4am Furinno\ud83d\udcaa It is small, cute, perfect for small spaces side table. You can\u2019t keep too many items on it if you don\u2019t want to clutter it. I keep my phone and watch for charging and nothing else so that I do not knock it over at night trying to check time. Mid shelf holds my notebooks and a few pens. The bottom shelf is pretty useless for me, because my bed is a bit too high with the frame and hence it\u2019s difficult to reach anything places on the bottom shelf. ", "This actually works great as a small bedside table when space is tight. Just needed a second bedside table for guests to have a place to charge their phone at night and set a little vase of \u201cWelcome flowers\u201d with a few Hershey kisses! I purchased this for my 6 yro son\u2019s bedside. He has a very narrow space & I just needed something to hold water, clock, a few books. I am pleasantly surprised by this little table! I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting much for the price but it looks much nicer than expected. You get what you pay for, and this is a great little end table for what it is! It was cheap in cost, and quality, but if you need a cheapo little nightstand or what ever, this is pretty good actually. I'm giving it a realistic 3 stars, because I simply don't believe you can get a 5 star quality item for marginally above $10. The price was right and I needed something halfway decent for a corner space by my couch. I'm happy with it. Very easy to assemble and sturdy enough to hold some books, a small lamp, various bits of daily debris and get my Wi-Fi modem out of the way (on the bottom shelf).  I wouldn't put any excessive force on it - no using it to boost myself up or anything but it won't blow over in a stiff breeze. I\u2019ve now bought a two pack of the end tables and then this end table. I bought this one to be a bed side table as my bed is very high up. The size of this table is just perfect for my needs. I have a lower sitting ikea bed frame so the height of the table is just right for the height Im at on the bed. I wasn\u2019t sure how sturdy it would be on carpet but it\u2019s actually just fine for everyday use. It would have been nice to have the second shelf be equidistant from the top and bottom shelves but at this price point I really can\u2019t complain. Ikea has an even cheaper nightstand for $10 but it only has two shelves so I opted for this Amazon one instead. Super simple to put together and not as cheap looking as I would have expected based on other reviews, but that\u2019s also subjective so take that with a grain of salt. Either way, very happy with the purchase! This is my second set. I use them as speaker stands for pretty heavy vintage speakers. My only complaint is for some reason this particular design (I have the two shelf model as well) is designed with a last screw on cap on top that there is nothing you can do to get tight enough to become close to flush. I trimmed most of one of with a Dremel and still nothing. I beat on it with a rubber mallet. I put 45 pound speakers on top.....they aren't going down the last 1/8th of an inch. The other set screws onto the \"wood\" from below so the entire top is smooth. That is MUCH better. No idea why they made this one differently and much much harder. If you can imagine pretty cheap plastic, you're on the right track. Take it down about one notch compared to whatever expectations that set for you and I think that's about what you'll get in the box. We got lucky with the QA, everything arrived intact and it all fit together about how it should have. I bought a pair to use as night stands in a bedroom, and they are definitely sturdy enough to hold a lamp, glasses, and phone+charger. I was highly pleased with this product. It is inexpensive, attractive, sturdy and an excellent value. It is highly suitable for holding lightweight items. I chose the black and white version. The shelves are black on one side, white on the other, and both sides smoothly finished. I alternated black and white for a striking appearance. No tools are needed for assembly, and the table is tight and sound when assembled, not shaky or wobbly. That said, I would not place more than about 15 lbs. on it, e.g., a flower pot, table lamp or the like. For the price, you will likely be very satisfied. Overall: It's cute and TINY! (my fault for not measuring properly). Definitely for small spaces, or more of a night stand than an end table. I have a couple of books on the first 2 tiers and 2 photo frames + my remote on the top shelf. ", "I purchased the 3 tier for a tiny space in the bathroom next to the bathtub.  Even with arthritic hands I was able to put it together easily.  Normally I'd do this bottom up construction, but it worked out better to stop with the top due to the flush pieces.  I also recommend threading the pieces together a time or two before going for full assembly. Bought a two pack of these and they\u2019re working well. We bought a couch that reclines but doesn\u2019t have a table in the middle. There\u2019s no spot to put a drink! This product definitely solves that. They are incredibly cheap though. You get what you pay for. If you want something cheap and for short term, these will do the job. This end table is now my console table. I managed to fit the following items on there, and it weighs a ton, but the stand is still holding up, so it's fairly sturdy by my accounts. I managed to put in two phat PS2s on the bottom, two phat xbox 360s, a launch ps4, and a nintendo wii (just barely), and a router on the top shelf. i was going to put my original xbox on top but the top of the xbox is not flat but rather concave and thus my router would wobble on top. This probably isnt really great for the heat generated by the systems but these machines only get turned on about once a week anyway. the xboxes on there are 7.7 pounds each, the ps4 is 6.2 lbs, wii is 2.7 lbs, the ps2s are 4 lbs each, and one has a 1.5 lb hard drive in it. Really enjoy my Levoit Warm-Cool Humidifier \u2014 where I can just set my desired humidity; cool-Summer, warm-Winter.  Well this simple, easy-to-assemble, little kit serves as the perfect humidifier stand, putting the mist out above head level while one sleeps.  Small, clean look (all white), efficient. Absolutely love this ! Sturdy and well designed, but execution is rather mediocre. It will certainly serve my needs, to hold up a printer and have room for paper and supplies. But it\u2019s absolutely not an heirloom piece. The legs are plastic with a lot of flash left over from the molding process. The shelves are particle board with mediocre Formica covering it and the edges are covered in banding with painfully obvious overlap and glue squeeze out. The black will be a dust magnet and the white has stains already on it. But, a novice can put it together with only elbow grease and zero tools. Easy to assemble.  When I saw the caps that screw into the top of the table I thought they might be a little tricky to assemble but was pleasantly surprised that they were easily done.  Directions state a capacity of about 10 lbs. per shelf and that seems about right.  I am going to put amateur radio gear on top of it so it is plenty strong.  Overall I am extremely pleased with construction and the looks.  Made from pressed wood and plastic it is not heirloom quality furniture, but IMO you cannot beat it for the money.  I am already thinking where I could put another one. I was excited to buy this because it had 4 and half stars and was inexpensive. When I got it the quality was as expected, wasn\u2019t expecting much for the price but it looked good. I got to assembling it and two of the long poles did NOT fit the short ones. And the ones that did fit were so hard to screw in. I was hoping there was a way to make it fit but I just gave up. I then took what I had apart. I did manage to make SOMETHING work because I did not want to go through the hassle to return it. I screwed the long poles into the short ones which left a small compartment in the bottom and the bigger compartment above it. So almost like if the table was flipped upside down. It works, doesn\u2019t look bad at all, and I\u2019m glad I got something to make it a table at least but definitely NOT what I initially wanted or expected and definitely would not recommend this product to anyone. I saw a plethora of bad reviews about this table and I am SOOOOO glad I ignored them! This little table is SUPER CUTE and holds my printer just as I hoped it would. I LOVE that you can reverse the boards to either have an all white table or black & white. I chose white and I am IN LOVE :-) It is crazy EASY to put together, took like 2 minutes! My 24 yr old daughter loved it so much that she ordered her one in Black immediately!! WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TABLE! It is difficult to understand the dimensions of the product while buying online.  Same thing happened here,  once it came,  noticed that it is much smaller than it appears. ", "Packed perfectly , very sturdy , inexpensive , and the exact size I needed ! I read in the description it only takes 10 minutes to assemble and no tools necessary. 10 min. ?- felt like 10 seconds ! With multiple sclerosis it took me longer to get the white plastic parts out of their bags (because of my numb-like fingers) than it took for me to easily assemble! I would say it was so easy this would be a nice challenge to give to my pre-school nephew to make , then maybe it would take 10 minutes. Glad I found this item !!! To get the uprights tightly screwed in, if your hand strength isn't great, it helps to have a pair of those floppy flat rubber or woven plastic squares for jar opening to improve your grip and get the last few turns done.  Other than that, assembly is a no-brainer and the result is stable and reasonably attractive.  It's clearly not a high or even middling end piece of furniture, but it's good quality for its price.  And yes, it is small, but if those dimensions are what you want, you'll be pleased with the result. I purchased 2 of these.  Super simple to put together, no tools needed. Tubes are made of plastic, but they work fine.  I really like them, they are the right height when sitting on couch or chair (I thought maybe they would be too short, but they are fine). I bought this to use as a plant stand for my succulents in my office so I wasn\u2019t looking for anything fancy. I chose it because I liked that it was billed as reversible and I could use the white side up. Unfortunately, the CA materials sticker took the white finish off when I peeled it off. Also the sides are uneven. All in all for less than $20 it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll make sure to put a plant over the tear on the shelf but if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s good quality and going to look nice I would pay a bit more. Super easy to assemble. I was in my third trimester (pregnant with twins) and was able to assemble this on my own. Its light weight and instructions are easy to follow. I am not usually any good at assembling things and make my husband do it for me. I use it as a small nightstand in our guest bedroom. This was inexpensive and works great for a place to place a phone or other items before doing to sleep, instead of the floor. This is lightweight material and the poles are plastic. It probably wouldn't be able to hold much weight, but would be fine for lightweight items. Highly recommend. While these aren't showroom pieces of furniture, they assemble quickly and easily and prove to be a surprisingly stable solution for twin bedroom nightstands.  Note that they are less than half the size of an average end table, so don't be expecting a lot of surface area.  But for the price, it's about what I expected, and I'm not displeased. I have been searching for a stand to hold my laptop next to my standing desk. I didn't want to spend much but I wanted to make sure it was stable. Local stores didn't carry anything close to what I was thinking - something not too high and something not too low and I wanted something white. That's it, one. No tools needed, all parts on hand, no missing parts or hardware to install. Boards sturdy and plastic tubing columns sturdy. Plastic... yes, but in tube form very sturdy. Unless u want to but ur 100lb cat to perch. Then buy it a cat condo. But for table top trinkets, hold ur meal, place a nice size plant... the BEST!!!! Even comes with instructions!!!! Get a couple for end tables or nice by the window for a plant. I ordered this product and had to return it twice because it came broken. First could have happened in shipping ads the particle wood was broken when I opened the box. 2nd time the thread was missing so one leg could not be screwed in.  Thr last time very bottom leg was broken.  I was so frustrated I just used hot glue to glue it and thankfully where I needed it, it is between a wall and a shower/sink vanity so it it keeping it stable.  If it wasn't thre only table to fit in that space,  I would have returned it permanently.  PURE JUNK! I bought this stand because it was cheap. I opened the box and thought oh well you get what you pay for. I started putting together and was quite pleased. super simple and tightened up very good. The more I looked at it and put my weight on it I liked it more. tried to find a reason not to give 5 stars. It is mass produced, a little flaw here and there but very sturdy and looks sharp. you can have white up or black up or mix it up. OK yes I love this little stand and probably buy another 5 stars. ", "I want nice!  I want my house to look like it's ALL THAT!  I am also not working like tons of us right now and need to spend less money on things!  THIS sturdy and fun to put together side table is awesome!  Looks like it cost much more than it does.  I got the brown and the black and white one.  Now the black and white one looked a little cheaper and I almost returned it until I put my green plant on it and some green decor on the other shelves and it looks SO cute!  I now want another black and white one. Easy to put together! All the pieces were there! And it fits in my bathroom! It meets all the requirements that I had. It sits level and doesn\u2019t wobble. When I first opened the box it had a terrible chemical smell. I got an instant pounding headache. I decided to put the tables together outside and see if they would air out. Assembly was very simple but after two days the smell did not diminish at all. I packed them up and returned. I love this shelf! I ordered the 3-tier, dark colored wood / black one. Each shelf feels thick and sturdy. The poles feel like they are made out of a relatively tough plastic. I\u2019m happy with my purchase! However, I gave this product 4 stars because of how the individual shelves look. The only issue is that you can see the real material (maybe polyboard?) on the edges, underneath the cover/vinyl/thing that looks like actual wood. Because of this, I\u2019ll just spray paint a clear sealant on it to make sure it stays looking new for a long time! Easy fix. 9/10, would recommend. I needed a cheap table to set next to a guest bed, somewhere you could place a lamp and a phone charger, nothing fancy.  I was purposefully shopping on a tight budget and ended up choosing this table.  It has a simple look that can pretty much go with anything and was well priced. I got this to put between my bath tub and toilet in the bathroom and it's worked well so far. It's main purpose is to hold personal cleansing cloths, morning coffees, and shower beers, so I haven't used it for anything heavy. It's a little wobbly if you put horizontal pressure on it, but it doesn't seem like it's going to fall or break. Simply said, it's what I expected for the price point and I'm not disappointed. It was easy to put together without tools, and it's nice that the surfaces are reversible, though I haven't tried to take it apart to switch to the other side. The smaller size and lower price point make it ideal for tiny spaces where you just need a flat surface to hold a couple of things, and the extra shelves are nice for holding things like extra toilet paper and bathroom spray. I love these nightstands! It's such a great deal for the price. The label is correct. No tools are necessary to assemble the nightstand. The black legs are plastic cylinders that you pop and screw into the brown wood. The night stands are super classy looking and are perfect for my room. The nightstands are ever so slightly a little wobbly, but i don't notice it at all unless i shake the stand around. I place things on the nightstand and don't have any problems with it wobbling or being unstable. Worth it for the price if you want something cheap and nice looking! I needed 2 small tables with shelves that were inexpensive and easy to put together.  This unit fit the bill on all counts. It truly was easy to put together in a very short time without tools.  I would ignore the diagram for the 1st step which showed you connecting the long pillar vertically on top of the bottom shelf to the short bottom knob.  I would suggest turning the bottom self on its side so that you can hold the connector pieces with both hands to screw them together. very flimsy It was like $12, so I feel I can only complain so much. It's just the right size for what I wanted, but it both feels and looks cheap...so I'm glad mine's for the most part out of sight. Would I buy it again? Eh. Probably, but like I said - only because I can mostly hide it while still using it. :D ", "The price is right!! Just the small size we were looking for. Super easy to put together (my 3 year old helped me). Reversable shelves. Sturdy enough for it's size, though not very heavy at all. Love the rounded edges of the shelves with my 3 year old around. I think the edges of the shelves could show wear and tear easily over time, but for the price I am very happy with this. It has multiple uses and I could see it being used as a night stand, side table, toy shelf, bathroom shelf, you name it. Highly recommend. When I upgraded my TV to a 32\" Smart TV in the bedroom, I realized there was no longer room on top of the dresser for the cable box.  Since I had a small space between the dresser and the radiator, I searched for a small shelf.  This one fit the bill perfectly! The height was just right, and the width and length fit in the spot just right.  Be advised that the measurements in the description are accurate, and when I say this is small, I mean it!!  I love that it was so easy to put together.  I was able to assemble it without directions in about 3 minutes!  If you need a small space shelf, that is actually quite sturdy, then I would recommend this one hands down! needed an economical table taller than a night stand but smaller than a bookshelf, this two-pack of three shelf tables easily assembled into a four shelf and a two shelf. the taller (29\") is perfect, a corner table by a window for my cat. the shorter 15\" one sits by my computer table for extra storage. these tables are sturdy and will hold the weight of my 16 pound tabby but probably not the weight of a child. my cat jumps from the floor to the top of the table without tipping it over but probably would tip it if it was not in a corner. highly recommend these tables and will most likely order more when needed. I love this way more than I expected too. Super easy to put together and price was amazing. I just needed something to put a lamp on and cover some cords up on the wall. This was perfect for that. It is pretty small, but that was what I needed. I\u2019m impressed with this little table. Doesn\u2019t get much easier to put together than this. No tools requires. Mine came in perfect condition! I\u2019m moving to a small apartment and this will fit perfectly and I love that I can take it apart for moving. This is perfect for next to my bed, I wouldn\u2019t say this would work next to a taller couch as it is pretty short. But If you\u2019re looking to save some $$$ this is an amazing buy! The top nobs are kind of hard to get completely flat that\u2019s my only complaint. This is a cheap little table but it\u2019s easy to put together, nice looking, and has lasted me for going on 3 years now. This thing has been with me through several relationships, three jobs, two hairstyles (2018 was a weird time) and one degree (2019 was an even weirder time). This thing is going to outlast every man I\u2019ll ever meet and when I\u2019m 87, kicked back in a rocking chair on a porch in North Carolina, this table will be beside me, holding my lemonade and my readers. 10/10 would purchase again. I just got this a couple of hours ago. In less than ten minutes I had it out of the box and put together. I was really surprised at the quality and sturdiness of the stand. All the threads on the plastic legs and inserts fit together well and the holes in the shelves were lined up perfectly. After assembly it looks like a stand worth 3 times what I paid for it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be looking at more of this manufacturers products. I wasn\u2019t expecting much for the price, but I am pleasantly surprised!  I really needed a little side table for in between my sofa and recliner. I have a floor lamp hence the need for a table. I am limited for space, so a large table just wouldn\u2019t do. So, I checked Amazon one of my favorite go to places to shop and found this.  This fits the space perfectly!  It was very easy to put together even though no instructions came in the box. I looked at the picture, used common sense and In just a few minutes I had a nice side table. I needed a small shelf for next to my couch (by a window) and this definitely fits the bill.  Assembly was so easy (no tools!) and you can mix and match the shelf color - went with white for top and bottom and black for the middle.  One of the panels was really dinged up, which is another reason I went for the black middle shelf, the white side was scratched and had a few holes in it but even with that I love how it looks, it fit the spot perfectly, it's sturdy (bottom shelf is all books and there's no wobble at all).  I may actually end up buying another one for the other side of the couch! In love with this little shelf. We were in need of two affordable nightstands that would match our current bedroom set, and these worked perfectly!! They look very nice, took all of 5 seconds to put together, and they don\u2019t look cheap! ", "Came in one day. Very easy to assemble. I ordered 2 of the white on white ones I spray painted them to use as side tables to my bedroom decor. Overall great buy Pros:easy to assemble, cheap, tier level adjustable by swapping plastic legs, good as night table for 2ft  high beds We got a new bed that sits high. These little tables are great to put your cell phone, glasses, charger, reading material, and coffee on! Insanely easy to assemble. I got one to try out, and my husband wanted to know where his was so I got him one for his side too. The price is the bargain of the year! When our Grand kids came last weekend, they grabbed my little table to use in front of the TV to draw on. These little tables are cute, light yet sturdy and offer great utility. For our needs above we are very happy! These two Furinno 3 tier end tables are amazingly beautiful!  The wood part Sonoma/white oak is gorgeous! If you just need a cheap, small, brown side table to hold some light things - this is your table. it can only hold up to 10 lbs per shelf and honestly i wouldn't gamble with that (definitely don't put anything valuable and heavy on this, like a tv, unless you want to throw that tv away).  the poles are plastic. I was just looking for something small to match my existing brown bookcases and it was like $20 so it was perfect. Great purchase! Especially for the money! I needed something small and simple for our bedside tables when we moved to our new house and I didn't want a wood look because our bedroom is all black and white. These are the perfect height and are just the right size to hold a lamp, alarm clock, and cell phone. I found baskets that fit perfectly on the second shelf to hold remotes, lotion, etc. Putting them together was super easy and took me maybe 5 minutes. My only advice when assembling is when you are putting on the top \"stoppers\", they don't have anything to grab onto which makes them difficult to grasp and tighten down to make flush. So when I put it together I held the stopper down flush first and turned the leg instead. I bought a specific color because they were half the price of the other two color options. I worried about the low cost leading to low quality, but I was wrong. These are great. The legs are a thick enough plastic that they won\u2019t break unless I wrestle with them on a drunken night. The top and shelves are durable and look pretty great. Even if these were low quality, the price would be worth it, but they\u2019re shockingly nice. I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOVE THIS TABLE!!  The only reason why I didn\u2019t give 5 stars is because the poles are plastic, the finish of the caps are not entirely polished and ultimately, it won\u2019t be 100% sturdy as this is not wood and screws made of. WITH THAT BEING SAID, none of those things are a deal breaker for me, as they are extremely affordable, and the fact that there\u2019s no screws included, you twist everything and your table is done in 3-5 MINUTES!!!! Seriously it can\u2019t get any easier and better than that. I ordered another one as I\u2019m stacking them to make two different heights and types for two different uses. You\u2019ll love them! Been living with our end table for nearly four months. Briefly diverted its use and realized it was just too perfect for bedside to live without. I collect old sewing drawers and found two fit perfectly side by side on the first shelf to store items I need to keep within arm's reach. Lowest shelf fits a mini swing top trash bin, a container of treats for our puppies & a water bottle. It's sturdy, well priced, and literally a \"snap\" to assemble. It is sturdy enough. Is it as sturdy as an all wood/metal stand, of course not. But it also isn't the same price as those options. It handles what I need, looks fine. I have one for my daughter's night stand and another for the other daughter who is using it as an end table for her couch. Goes together excessively quick, just don't cross thread, with no tools. ", "Bought this for my son to put his gaming unit on.  It's just ok and we ended up buying something a little more sturdier.  It held the units fine, but it was pretty wobbly.  We still use it to hold a couple of his school books, but I would not recommend it and I wouldn't purchase it again.  I'm really surprised by the reviews that show people placing lamps and such on this table.  I just don't think I'd trust it to hold anything of value. Was so excited to get this little table, but seeing the shelves being so marked up, I just couldn't keep it. I thought about ordering another (and the price dropped even more since I bought it), but I don't feel like dealing with more of the same. In all of the posted reviews, I did not see any on this particular color combo (French Oak Grey/Black). Perhaps the whole lot is like this? I don't want to chance it. I\u2019m incredibly happy with this purchase. I was looking for a small table to fit in a small space next to my prayer chair. It\u2019s the perfect size to hold my prayer books & a religious statue. My only complaint is the top screws were hard to get tight without having a spot to use a screwdriver, which is why I\u2019m only giving a 4 star review. Otherwise it was simple to assemble & was able to do so in 10 minutes. It is made with plastic legs & pressed wood but that is not an issue for me especially considering the price I paid. I bought this as my night stand, needed a small table next to my bed to hold my cell and lamp and it\u2019s perfect! It fitted perfect. I love how easy I was able to assemble it although I had a bit trouble getting some of the legs in..it\u2019s not the best quality material but it\u2019s perfect for me since I just needed a small table to basically hold my cells, remote nightlight and some books in the bottom shelf. So don\u2019t put heavy things cuz the limit is 10lbs on each shelf. But overall I lived it! Easy to wipe, after my son colored a bit with his colors! I have this tiny space between the built-in counter to the wall. This was the only thing that matches that space. I first got one. Then I got the second one. I screwed the second one on top of the first one. Maybe that\u2019s why, I feel it wobbles a little. But it\u2019s not affect the usage. I guess now that I have two, you could mixed how you want the shelves to be. I would not go more than 2 though, unless it is supported in 3 ways by walls If you are looking for a cheap table that will do the job, this is it. It is sturdy in that it's stable and won't fall apart, though it can't take too much weight (books, drinks, a lamp would be fine, but no TVs or such).  It is reversible to be either black or white, but one thing to note is that if you want white sides facing up, there is a sticker on the white side of one of the shelves. I attempted to carefully remove it and it pulled part of the white off. I strategically placed it as the middle shelf so it's not noticeable, but something to keep in mind. For the price this end table is a bargain. I was just looking for something to fit between my wall and bed to hold my cell phone and other devices at night. This fit perfectly. It was easy to assembly, everything screwed together. It\u2019s a little wobbly if it was to be on a solid surface but on carpet and snugged between my wall and bed this fit my needs. It\u2019s definitely cheap feeling, but offers great value and is sturdy enough for my devices. I like these tables a lot. I\u2019ve bought a few different types. I was slightly disappointed as I ordered white on white, but received black on black. And they were a little scratched up as well. Figured it wasn\u2019t worth it to go thru all the trouble of returning and waiting, so I just kept them. Still a good product, just got the colors wrong in shipping. Still recommend. Great little table. Perfect size for a small night table for a child. Very light weight and easy to assemble. The directions say to start at the bottom (the \u201cfeet\u201d For a lack of a better word, but when your done assembly you can\u2019t get the top caps flush. Start from the caps (at the top) and work your way down to the feet. Then everything is nice and flush. The feet have a lot more to hold on to to tighten. I recommend for sure! I have all FURRINO oak grey in my house, and of all the things I\u2019ve had to put together this was by FAR the easiest. No tools necessary, it literally took me 10 minutes! They are the perfect height they aren\u2019t the most sturdy, but they serve their purpose. Definitely worth the money. ", "You get what you pay for. Yes it's cheap and a great price but the quality control is awful. Very hard to put together since two side of the screw peg are flat and are very hard to screw them in straight. The boards are particle board and before I even got it put together looked chipped and crappy. It's for my daughters room so it will work fine but definitely would not recommend and would not buy again, just save your money and buy something a little nicer. It was very easy to put together, it took me less then 5 minutes however, Cheaply made and I doubt the wood will stay intact long. The edges of the shelves are cracked and honestly kindof sharp, I'm scared of hitting an edge and slicing my hand open or something. I will say it's a great height and for the price,  what can you expect. It wobbles when you shake it but i don't think anything would fall off it if you bonked or accedently hit it. It's a beautiful shelf if the shelves were made better and not so cheap. I was initially wary about buying this end table but it's come through quite well: it was crazy easy to assemble, did it in 10 mins tops plus it's very sturdy despite the poles being made from a not so sturdy plastic. The wood itself appears smoothly made (which I will treasure because a poor tree had to give it's life for it) and very easy to keep clean. My only draw back is that it's not quite as tall as the pics made it look. Great quality for a great price overall. Super easy to put together, look great, just a little flimsy. We're using them for nightstands so the most they usually have on them is a drinking glass, phone, book, and pistol (using the various shelves). We don't ever move them around, so it's not a huge deal. Just wouldn't be too demanding in the weight you put on them. Overall, good quality for the price. This item is great for its price. Its really small, my laptop is even bigger than the shelves. This isn\u2019t a bad thing. It keeps you from cluttering up the room. It is really easy to put together, less than 5 minutes and no tools needed. The only thing I would say the shelf is lacking is sturdiness. Since it is small I could say it shouldn\u2019t be a problem but I wouldn\u2019t put anything heavy on the top. Nice, small, sturdy side table! Perfect for the small space in my office.  I wanted something to put my Keurig and small refrigerator on and this fits perfectly!  It is sturdy and light enough to move around.  I thought I read in the description it was assembled, but it wasn't.  No biggie. I was able to assemble in less than 10 minutes total from unpacking to completion. Really easy. Overall nice piece for the money and would get another if I needed to. Great product for the price.  Way easy to put together.  No tools needed.  Perfect for small table next to couch to set books/ drinks on.  (With coaster) \ud83e\udd2a It was shorter than I thought it would be although that is my own fault as the hight is clearly in the description. I\u2019m happier with this than I expected! I ended up buying a different end table from Walmart because I just kind of assumed this wouldn\u2019t be what I wanted. Turns out I was wrong and I like this one way more! I had an oil diffuser set up on it now and that\u2019s been great. I love the different levels and I\u2019m honestly so happy with it! It doesn\u2019t hold a ton of weight likely 5-10lbs max per shelf but I don\u2019t anticipate trying to put anything heavier on it anyways. ", "I bought 2 of these to use, one for our dog food vault and one for the dog dishes.  These are very easy to assemble and are sturdy.  The dog food is kind of heavy, and we have a couple 12 pack of soda cans stored on the lower shelf on the other one, but they are plenty strong enough to handle the weight.  They look nice and I think they will hold up. Manufacturing is generally inexpensive with some inconsistencies and small flaws but it assembled fine. The shelves are particle board. The tube risers are hollow plastic. Plus: it's light, quick to assemble, and it could be taken apart to be easily moved and re-assembled. I would really like to give this table a good review because it\u2019s cute, easy to assemble, and lightweight. Unfortunately, it came with all of the edges damaged. It looks like the paint is scraped off of the edges. Really, there are markings all over the table edges. In addition, pay attention to the measurements, because it is much smaller than I anticipated. It is smaller than a fold out dinner tray  (and shorter than one). Works well for my purpose. I needed a small enough table to not take up a bunch of space and that was high enough to be usable. I had a larger shorter one, but it was inconvenient to reach over the couch arm for things and not knock them over. I will probably be buying a couple more for the small bedroom upstairs. It seems pretty stable too. I realize you get what you pay for but you should at least be able to assemble it.  A couple of the poles are too large for the holes they are supposed to screw into and you cannot get it connected all the way.  Actually some of the poles aren't quite round and that's why they don't fit.  Maybe if you have the strength of Hercules you could assemble it but I sure couldn't. It\u2019s really to bad that the stickers they put on the shelves do not come off without ripping the white stick on finish off.. it\u2019s coming off all around the edges too. It\u2019s a perfect size and design but all the sheathing is coming off. Now I will have to paint and try to stick the laminate back on. It\u2019s gonna cost me to make this right.. The tables were very easy to put together. They look nice and are a good height as end tables for my bedroom. The legs are plastic but strong and the tables are sturdy. We are using this table to keep our Google Home Hub on and pretty much nothing else. It's perfect for what we needed.  I was super easy to put together, and it looks nice. I am happy with the price and its a lot more sturdy than expected. I will not be placing anything heavy on it so I can't speak on that, but if you're using it for something simple like we are, I highly recommend it! Look. This is a cheap little fiberboard table with screw-in plastic supports. I'm fine with that. It is not meant to hold a lot of weight or for heavy use. Once it's put together, it's pretty stable. It takes a bit of hand strength to assemble, if that's an issue, you might want to ask for assistance. Don't over-tighten the posts, the fiberboard is fragile. It's all I needed to organize a messy corner. I wanted to try this table first. I will buy more for similar light-duty uses. This little table is pretty good. It serves The purpose. When you\u2019re putting it together you might think that some of the parts are not going to go together but don\u2019t give up eventually they do. I also purchased \u201cShepherd Hardware Slideglide 1 1/2\" Furniture Sliders 9455\u201d To put on the feet so It slides easier on carpet. They overlap the bottom feet by about 1/8 of an inch around. I used longer screws and screwed them into the bottom of the tables feet which have an indentation ... worked nice. ", "The eeeeeasiest table to put together. Ever. It is a but shorter than I thought. It is sturdy, and really cute. The shelves are not evenly spaced apart, so the second shelf is smaller spaced than the bottom shelf but each one is good sized enough to be useful. If you need some shelf space for a small space, you should get this shelf put together in very few short minutes. really the instructions are good but not needed. can be configured in many different ways. needed two small tables for the medify m40 air filters, and though those would work. and now it seems as if they were built for them. perfect fit. even the color. for me yes, perfect, for for any other purpose they really are very good. Absolutely perfect. I bought 2 sizes to keep in my walk in closet and hold many things, many heavy things. It looks exactly like the pictures and description states, it's VERY steady, so easy to put together, took less than a minute and it's made very well. I bought the walnut color and it's nice enough to have in a room and not a closet, highly recommend. Great for small spaces. Easy enough to assemble. Lightweight to move around. My stars end there. the table looks nice and was really easy to put together however there was one big flaw when I opened it out of the box expect your brand new products the edges were a bit broken it wasn't enough to cause any sort of issues or anything like that it was very very minor although that is something to note they were just a little bit blemished it didn't affect the product starting as anything like that it was just more of a decorative thing nothing to bother me too much however it is something to know It's a $15 table so that's a really good price. It even has a total of 3 shelves. The only cons are: It doesn't look great or posh so don't expect extreme value. It looks nice from a distance but a bit rougher up close. It is small, smaller than most side tables you would typically encounter so keep that in mind. Great for entry level purposes though. So many side tables are a joke costing as much as $250. Unbelievably easy to assemble. Took less than 10 minutes for both stands. It literally screws together (shortest on bottom, then shelf. Longest next, then shelf. Medium up high, then shelf. Then the caps on top last.) seem very well made, and were perfect for the 12x16 spaces I needed them for beside the bed. My only concern with the table (and the reason for the low review) is that the product sticker that was placed one of the table tops was difficult to remove and peeled off the surface when I attempted to remove it. I have to place a lamp over that spot so I don\u2019t see the damage. Other than that, the table is perfect for what I needed it for. I have one couch in my tiny living room. One side is up against the wall, the other is a few inches from the door. I couldn't fit an end table and was using a plant stand to put a lamp on. This table is Wonderful. Assembles in less than five minutes with no tools and you don't need instructions. It's like an end table split in half. And it's cheap. Exactly as pictured and the size stated. I love it. I really like these tables as they are the perfect height for putting my lamps on.  They come well packaged in small boxes, which don't take up much space, and are the easiest pieces of furniture which I have ever assembled.  I had both tables completed in twenty minutes with no tools required.  All that these table lack are felt or rubber pads for the bottom of the legs.  Other than that, I have no complaints. ", "Very easy to put together, quality is decent, a tad wobbly.  I have looked at other products by this company and most of the reviews have been pretty terrible.  I figured this might work for what I needed, and if not I could always return it.  I purchased two of these to use as nightstands for my children's bedrooms. It says 10 minutes to put together. It was more like 3. Very, very simple to put together, and a little cheap, but they are on the cheaper side price wise. They fit next to the bed well, and don't take up a lot of space, which is good. I do wish they were slightly taller, but I can still easily reach the stand without an issue. No issues with them being uneven or wobbly. These tables are getting a bad review not because they are bad tables...as a matter of fact they are very nice for the price. The 3 stars is because of the shavings of plastic still left in the tubes and you are forced to clean all of them before you can even screw them on. We just bought 2 of the french grey tables a few days ago and there was nothing like this! It looked like someone skipped the last step in quality before shipping. With that said these black and white tables are good for nightstands and very sturdy This is just the right size for a very small guest bedroom. Fits a small lamp, tissues and a book on the top 2 shelves with room at the bottom. Does not make the room look crowded. It could have used a bit more height since the bed is high, but it still works and I didn't want to have to buy different tubes or add to it with a second table. The best thing is it's very stable and sturdy for such  small table The assembly of this table took maybe 5 minutes and didn't require tools since all the parts screw together which was the most important thing for me. After assembly the table is really light and easy to move to where you want it, but it is still stable once placed on the ground. I use it by my vanity for an easy place to grab things I use everyday and then the bottom two sections are filled with books to read and what not. The table fits in with the aesthetic of my room and the reversible tops make it really versatile when it comes to decor. Fits the space I have, and does the job, but one of the shelves had a sticker with manufacturing info, and when I took it off, some of the veneer came off. Of course, it was the last shelf, which was to be the top, so I flipped it over. Now I have two white shelves and one black one, because I didn't want to take it apart. Appears to be able to support a fair amount of weight. Mine is a little wobbly, but barely. For the price of this it is well worth the money. It was super easy to assemble. You just twist all the tubes together, I didn't even look at the instructions and it took me a total of five minutes to open the box and have it put together. It's small but perfect for what I needed. I placed next to a chair with a small lamp. Im very happy with my purchase. I needed a small stand for an indoor TV antenna and wanted to pay as little as possible for something that worked and wasn't an eyesore. This stand looks fine and is way better than it had any right to be at $15. It's stable and doesn't wobble, but I don't think it would hold a lot of weight. It would work as a phone stand or plant stand. Easy to assemble for the most part but the four cap pieces are a little tricky to screw down flush. Overall, I'm still happy enough to give it 5 stars given its incredible affordability. I want to give this product a 5 star but I really can't. I like that it was easy to assemble and it is sturdy but it is small. I can hold two phones and a water bottle on the top shelf. but that is pushing it. it get cramp on it. I guess I was hoping it would have been a little bigger and this product would have been perfect. ", "This was supposed to It\u2019s really cheap. It\u2019s true when they say \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d I\u2019m giving mine away for free on Facebook. Go with a sturdier option. Its a nice little table. Fits well in my small bathroom. For $14, it's perfect. Just an FYI, I paid for 2 (I was gonna use them as nightstands) but only received one table. There was no way for me to contact seller that day so I reached out to Amazon & just got a refund for the 2nd table. No big deal for me. I used these little tables in a small bedroom as end tables. They are perfect for that room. Big enough for a small lamp and other small items (glasses, charger, etc.). Bought to store a couple items on next to crib.  It was rather easy to put together, and works for lightweight items.  I would not recommend putting heavier items on it as the shelves are very light weight and I would not trust putting heavier items on it.  Good for tight spaces if you are needing something simple. I needed a small bed side table to hold my alarm clock and a few other things, but just needed something small and inexpensive to fit between my bed and the wall. This works perfectly. I put it together in probably 5 minutes. The extra shelves are a bonus to hold books and my drean journal. Just a good option if you don't want to spend a lot of moola for a small bedside table. Excellent little shelf for cheap.  The finish is amazing, considering it is only $15.  The printed wood look has a slight grain texture when looked at from an angle - far nicer than I expected for that price.  Easy to assemble, took about 5 minutes.  The longer bottom shelf pieces were a bit harder to twist, so it will take some strength to turn.. but it is sturdy and solid when all together. It is small for a small space; however, it is not really easy to assemble. You need to find a specific angel to assemble it.. especially the top one is more difficult because you can\u2019t really roll it. For sturdiness, I will say not that good, it will shake but I can\u2019t tell is it because I put it on the carpet or not. But since this it quite cheap product, I will say isn\u2019t that bad We have our PS4 and PSVR with a unique space in our apartment that didnt fit them on our tv media stand. So we searched FOREVER for something skinny enough and tall enough between the shelves to house our PS4 on its side and our PSVR. This one won them all! Appreciate it was inexpensive but blends in nicely. Obviously, this is not a table that you're going to pass on to your grandchildren. But if you need a light-duty end table/nightstand and don't want or can't affort to pay a lot, this is well worth the price. I've never had flat-pack furniture that was so quick & easy to put together. It looks nice and it's pretty stable by my bed. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again & I'm probably going to buy the bigger shelf for another spot in my house soon. ", "Very easy to assemble, plastic and fiber board with laminate tops. Cute and functional for my needs. All shelves we\u2019re marred but the imperfections won\u2019t show on the bottom shelves and a coaster will disguise the top scar. Type of furniture good for a dorm room or, in my case, between two chairs in the tv room. This was a major home run! I hate and am not good at putting things together but this was not only so easy to put together but enjoyable! No tools required, took me less than 10 mins. It\u2019s a perfect little table to hold your plants or next to your bed. I love it. I\u2019m 5\u20195.. this table comes up to an inch above my knees. This was just what I was looking for to hold my plants for the winter. So easy to assemble and looks great!! I love these. Perfect side tables! They are great little tables. Easy to assemble, my 7 year old figured it out without looking at the directions. my only complaint is because they are so light, they feel a little unstable on carpet. I just put some heavy books on the bottom to solve this problem. Also make sure to use coasters if you put a drink on them. Overall, great tables at a great price. I've had these for a few months now, and they've added some much needed storage surface area to my room. They were easy to assemble, it took about half the time that the manual said it would, maybe 3 minutes tops to screw all of the legs together. It's particle board, but definitely well made and sturdy. I've had more than the recommended max load on the bottom shelf, and it hasn't caused any issues thus far. Fits nicely in small areas, so it's great for a city apartment. Can't find any comparable multi-tier tables for the price, not even from IKEA. My son needed a small end table in his room and this worked perfect. I ended up buying 2 to go on either side of his bed. I put one together and my 10 and 7 year old boys put the other together. No tools are needed as all the pieces just twist in together. Super easy to assemble and was the same height as his bed. Overall it\u2019s a solid and functional shelf to use for night stand at a dorm room or bookshelf anywhere. Black and white goes well with any decor. The wood did come chipped on some sides of the boards which I\u2019m not too happy about. But for a $10 shelf I can live with it. Easy to assemble took me like 5 minutes. I have no complaints. I wasn\u2019t going for the most sturdy object in the world I just wants something to hold my bible, tv remote, and cell phone. I bout shelves from this same company and was impressed and I am impressed with this end table as well. It fits in a very small space between my bed and the gun cabinet. Would buy again The shelf unit arrived 5 days late and was missing one of the 3 shelves. There\u2019s a lengthy process to request a replacement part, and no information when it will be sent. I did request the missing part, but. by the time it arrives, I will have no use for it. I purchased this for my college apartment to be used as a nightstand/side table for things I frequently needed to grab. After approximately a month, the table has a few scratches on it, but it's serving its purpose. It handles a decent amount of weight, but I wouldn't put anything too heavy on it. ", "Just like the 5 Tier corner shelf, this is built very sturdy, nice dark wooden shelf for just about anywhere In Your house. I have mine holding industrial chargers for my drills and on top my printer. So nice, I order one more for the living room for remotes and such. Not too y\u2019all just an FYI but it\u2019s a nice height. Cheap. Easy to assemble. You can make the shelves all black, or all white, or switch them up. I like it, personally. It is lightweight and cheap, however. I hope whoever uses it in my rental room will weigh it down with some books at the bottom so it does not tip over. But you get what you paid for and I got what I wanted and, for the most part, I am happy. The thing I love about this is I don\u2019t have to ask my bf to ensemble it. It was so easy haha. Anyways this end table is the cutest thing ever! It\u2019s good for flower decor or books and also it\u2019s tiny. The color it self it\u2019s nice! The only thing I didn\u2019t like is the holder it\u2019s not a wood. It\u2019s plastic. But other than that it\u2019s cute for a small decor around your house. I am very disappointed, first of all, though I know, it very inexpensive, i read the reviews and decided to give it a try, well the stand doesn't hold up , it was completely lopsided, due to the It's a cheap little table, and you get what you pay for. Legs are hollow plastic. Taking the manufacturer's sticker off of one of the shelves took the veneer with it. But it will work beautifully as a nightstand for a 5 year old, which is why I wanted it. Suits our needs just fine. Its bigger than I expected. I'm really happy with the height and width. Only negative, is I had to build it upside down like I did my tv stand (from top top to bottom). It was not possible for me to get top caps screwed tight doing them last. Building it from top to bottom ensured that they laid flat. I brought this little table because the price was perfect and I am very pleased with it it is dirty and easy to put together and does the trick. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a little side table you can make it black if you turn over thee board or you can make it all white We needed a small table that had a shelf, and this was perfect. Legs are plastic and shelves are wood. Easy to assemble, no tools required. I'm 8 months pregnant and could lift and put together in less than 10 minutes. We got white/white, but one side was white, and the other is black which we were ok with. I was looking for a small bedside table that had at least two shelves so having that third one is a plus. It was very easy to put together so for me, the Furinno table was a great find. I especially like the option to use the black or white color for the shelves. I went with the black but can reverse that later if I want to. It was a nice little bed side table. Its sturdy and so easy to put together. No screws, just twist into place. With that said, I'm not sure how much weight it can support but its sturdy enough for the usual alarm clock, phone, picture. The surface area is quite small thought. The side of the first gen of iPads. ", "This fit perfect next to my headboard. I needed a little extra space once I had to add a CPAP machine to the top of the headboard. My phones fit on it and my bedtime routine lotions fit nicely on the little shelf. My water for my CPAP fits nicely on the bottom. Best of all - it matches the finish of my headboard quite well? I needed an extra small table in my bedroom for a few odds and ends that take up too much space on my nightstand, and this little table is absolutely PERFECT! I love that it has 2 shelves in addition to the top. It was super easy to put together, just basically screw the legs in and you're done! Great purchase, great price! None This is a great little table. Seems pretty sturdy for the most part. Exactly as I expected for $20. Will do exactly what I want it to do. Just needed a little something temporary for next to my bed to charge things on. This fits the bill! I love the corralling I can do with a seemingly small piece of furniture but it holds a lot. Perfect as a side table/night stand.  Clean and minimalist look which is perfect for my bedroom setting. Easy to assemble and very sturdy for something that takes around 5 minutes for a \"not so physically fit\" person to put together. Also, very easy to wipe clean. For the price, LOVE IT! ! Will most likely purchase again if the need arises! This is a great side table and it fit exactly where I wanted it to perfectly. The table looks really good. The only concern I have of the table is it\u2019s sturdiness. In the instructions it warns to not put more than ten pounds on any of the levels. I thought that was a little light. The legs and the connecting poles of the table are made out of plastic. Granted it\u2019s not bad plastic, it wasn\u2019t really malleable at all but it did feel just a little cheap. But then again, it does cost $22. It\u2019s not a big deal though and it hasn\u2019t ruined it for me at all. I like the table a lot overall and would definitely recommend it. We were pleasantly surprised with these tables. We bought one three shelved table for bedside and liked it so much we bought another! Sturdy, easy to put together, and you can turn the sides over to choose black or white. Will hold an average sized lamp with items on other shelves easily. Both orders arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Highly recommend! Really impressed with this low cost end table.  It looks exactly as advertised and I put it together myself in a couple minutes (that's saying a lot!) I usually love these products, but I'm not impressed with this one. I don't like the plastic screws that go in to the top. It's nearly impossible to screw them on completely leaving the top shelf a little loose. My hands also hurt from trying. This should be made like all their other furniture. Without buttons on the top. This table is perfect for small spaces. We have a fairly generous size living room in our new house, but it is an odd shape for the furniture we have now. We needed somewhere to sit drinks, phones or a lamp and this was perfect. Small enough to be out of the way or moved if needed, but surprisingly sturdy for the size. I ordered 2 of these at once, assembly took maybe 10 minutes total. I would 100% order again for the guest rooms. ", "Thanks to the interchangeable parts, I was able to combine two small stands to make one tall one.  Furinno furniture is the greatest--I have several pieces that I've used in different configurations. This furniture is not intended to be heirloom quality, just quick, attractive, and practical, This is a great little stand. It's perfect for holding canned pet food, and it fits nicely in the small space that I have for it. I also have other cat products on the additional shelves. I was afraid that the black would show when I wanted all white, and it does not. Very pleased with this stand, and would definitely not hesitate to purchase another. I wasn\u2019t happy when I opened it, because all pieces had some sort of manufacturing defect.. but I really needed a simple night stand for my kid fast, so I just assembled it in a way that the scratches and dents don\u2019t show so much. These tables and brand overall are perfect when you dorm want or need to spend a lot of money. My son has one for a bedside table and is perfect for that purpose. I also have one next to my office desk to hold my printer with the paper underneath and paper shredder on the bottom shelf - perfect for that purpose, too! Easy to put together and I mean EASY (I love anything with no tools required).  Its small and fits the space perfectly, plus I have a tall item I wanted to put on the bottom shelf, so I like that the shelves are not half and half.  Easy to wipe off.  Color is actually black.  Inexpensive.  I just can't think of a single negative. Although you may check the dimensions a few times, beware that they will be smaller than expected. I was fully aware of their size but was shocked to see that they were smaller than expected. They are good for the money, considering that you get two, however, one is not level. I am not willing to give this four stars as there are two for around $30.00 and have an appropriate height. I think that this is an exceptional buy until you are ready to invest in something more expensive and/or complex. You deffo get what you pay for with these (not in a negative sense) and they serve their purpose well! They're sturdy enough that I'm balancing a heavy keyboard on them, and look good too. Obviously slightly more flipsy materials, so not for heavy duty use, but everything came in-tact and color just as described. Perfect little side-table/shelves for any living room. Easy to put together, decent table, but lightweight.  It should be noted that the legs are plastic, but you can't really tell by looking at it. I was so disappointed when I received this. DON\"T waste your money...it has cheap plastic poles that don't screw together tight. Chipped and scratched shelves made of particle board. It is NOT stable at all! I'm not sure who reviewed this five stars because it isn't even one star! Returning! I love this piece of furniture. Took me 5 minutes to put together and the wood is real...not cheap composite. The tubes are plastic which I was worried about looking cheap but once it's all together it looks great. Would def recommend. It's perfect for me to use as a bedside table. Fits great in the small space I have and is extremely affordable! Buy this. ", "Cute but a bit cheap looking. Will put outside on balcony for pots and soil. Good for price though just not up too my standards for furniture inside. I had originally purchased three of these and I was going to stack them and attach them with Velcro tape, however during my assembly I noticed that was not necessary and I could just keep adding shelf after shelf with use of the poles. I did wind up having some leftover panels and poles left, however I am very content with how I decided to go about assembly. Created a tall organizational shelf for a thin small space Super easy to assemble. I was skeptical looking at the quality of the individual parts, but once I built them, I was very surprised and pleased. Not to mention, it\u2019s very easy on the eyes, doesn\u2019t look cheap at all. Sturdy enough to hold my PS4 among other items. Very nice budget bedside table.  It was the easiest piece of furniture I've ever assembled - literally no tools needed, everything twists on.  It's remarkably stable  and holds quite a bit of stuff on its 3 tiers.  Looks much more expensive than it was.  Excellent buy. It's a nice, little inexpensive table! You get what you pay for. I just needed a cheap little table to put a humidifier on next to my bed. It is fine and sturdy. I did not want to spend too much because I will be moving later this year and buying all new furniture when I do. I will get my money's worth out of this until then. I love no screws furniture like this. The pieces go together so easily and fast. I use it as a side table. For the top and shelf, one side is black and one side is white. You have a choice of how you want the shelves to be. Sturdy, easy assembly and a good price. Can\u2019t go wrong. The table is very cheap, sturdy, stable, and good looking. Only problem is that I bought it as a shelf on which my Xbox and my PC could sit. It does accomplish that, but I was intending on placing my PC on the bottom, my Xbox in the middle, and like chargers for my phone and other things on the top. Came to find out that it is not wide enough to accommodate my Xbox, so now my Xbox has to be on top which kinda defeats the purpose of my intention of having a convenient shelf right on top for my phone and other things. I give the item 5 stars all around though because that issue is really just on me. Can\u2019t fault the table when it gave all the necessary information (and delivered) just because Im too lazy to read. In the end though it still does it\u2019s job well enough for me so yeah. I purchased the shelf for a bathroom corner and plan use the shelf to hold a  decorative candle and other items.  Not beautiful, and not unattractive so I think it will be nice one I add a few  decorative items.  Good value for the price. Very, very easy to assemble.  Shelf is made of a composite material (not wood) legs are plastic,  and the assembled shelf is sturdy. This is the perfect multi-use stand. I can use it for so many things as a night stand, to hold towels in bathroom, as a small plant holder or to put small pictures on, it's just perfect in every way. I also want to add that this was very easy to assemble took less then 5 minutes! I needed a nightstand for my college apartment bedroom and this was perfect! Assembly started to hurt my hand a little towards the end due to the repetitive motion needed and the amount of screws given but it was worth it. It did exactly what I needed it to do and I can take it down and reuse it again in my next apartment. The black and white is cute and the size is perfect for a small nightstand holding my table lamp, glasses, ring holder and a up of water! ", "I wanted something small and narrow to put in the corner of my closet.  Most things are way too big unless you don't mind crushing your clothes!  When this table arrived it literally took me five minutes to put it together, and it is perfect for the purpose for which it was purchased.  I wouldn't exactly call it an end table unless you like PVC tube furniture, but it's sturdy and functional.  I'm a happy purchaser! This is nothing fancy, which is to be expected for the price point. That said, I'm not at all disappointed in this purchase. It was super easy to put together and seems perfectly sturdy (though very lightweight).  I got the white/espresso but the espresso side of the selves (they're reversible, which is nice) seems black as far as I can tell (which for me is fine, I actually wanted black but this one was cheaper). We were creating a second, simple kitchen in our basement.  This little shelving unit fits neatly under the countertop gap between the sink cupboard and the pantry.  It disguised some ugly but necessary plumbing. I bought this stand for a night stand and it does it's job.  It was fairly easy to put together.  They are plastic tubes that screw together.  The top pieces were a little difficult to screw in only because they are small and there's nothing to get a good grip on.  The pieces are low quality and aren't the most attractive - you you definitely tell that the legs are plastic.  I wouldn't recommend this for anything really heavy.  Overall this is a good stand, but if you are looking for something stylish and extra sturdy, I would look elsewhere. I bought this to go with the Furnnio TV stand I bought.  It has labels on both sides of one shelf that were not the kind that peel off easily.  I did try to wipe it off with warm water, A mistake because the surface of the shelf wore through as well.  I wouldn\u2019t buy it again! It's a cheap plastic table. A little lopsided so I have to put something underneath to balance it. I didn't expect much at this price. Use it next to my desk to put drinks on it. As for the pictures giving you the idea to fill your house with these...I wouldn't advise. This table looks good, and functional, and easy to assemble, my only issue with it that it's made with cheap materials, the table came with scratches on it and poles were mad out of plastic, and I needed to remove some of the plastic to be able to screw it in. for what i bought them for they work great. assembles very simple and would buy again also have a bigger one for my grandsons 32\" tv and play station 4 he love it.  thanks Amazing table at an amazing price. So easy to put together. Table is sturdy and great for small spaces. I\u2019m terrible with visualizing dimensions so I\u2019ll say each shelf is the size if 1 and 1/2 Oprah magazines!  Perfect table for my new tiny \u201chome office\u201d My 11 year old was able to put this together easily. It\u2019s perfect for the space I wanted. We have a small house so I just needed something to sit beside my chair during baby bottle feeding time to easily reach for things. The shelves on the bottom is a perfect size to fit a basket that I keep bibs and burp rags in which is what I was hoping for. I would buy again. I also love the color which was a white one. ", "This small table assembles tool-free in just a few minutes, Assembly is so easy directions are not needed. Moved into a new place and wanted something as a nightstand that didn't take up too much space. This works well! Can put books,phone, wallet, etc. on it. Drinks have been fine too. I initially worried about how sturdy it would be but haven't had issues. Easy to assemble! I put this table together with the help of a three year old. It was fast and easy. I love how everything just screws together. It fits in small spaces which is wonderful as well. This table is more sturdy than it appears. My 33 pound child has sat on top of it multiple times and it doesn't creak and hasn't cracked or bent. Good value for the money. Perfect to set the controller, remotes and phones on. It is very sturdy. The top is pressed wood so when setting drinks down I would place something down first. I also covered my top with \"Stretch to fit food covers\" the red ones fit perfectly. I needed a super simple end table for my living room that I could set my coffee on while I was getting ready. It was very easy to assemble and it most definitely gets the job done. If you are looking for a super cute and trendy end table this is not what you are going to want to purchase, but I just needed something to stick in the corner and this was 100% the right choice. It is pretty sturdy in regards to no wobbling but the legs are plastic so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on it. Easy to assemble. Looks just as described. Matches the picture. Not sure why there are negative comments. Mine was in 2 boxes: originally box inside another box. Those that claim holes dont match are assembling it wrong. EXACTLY what i wanted. Can put together in a matter of minutes.  Seems sturdy enough for my purpose (using as speaker stands for my turntable) and the storage on the bottom is perfect for overflow records. I wasn't it expecting it to be so short but it's the perfect size for my sewing room. I wanted this for my printer but I'll have to find a bigger one for another use. It's 22 inches tall and 13 inches wide. I bought this as a small table next to my daughter's bed.  It was fairly easy to assemble but I'm very disappointed that, although the box was not damaged, all three shelves had a crack in them.  Almost like someone tried to bend them.  Weird.  I was able to put the damaged parts towards the back so they only show if you get close up to the table.  Considering the cost, I guess you can't expect much, but I was still disappointed that they went ahead and packaged 3 (obviously) damaged pieces of wood. This is much smaller than I thought it would be - it is definitely for a small space. ", "Definitely for small spaces. It\u2019s super easy to assemble and it\u2019s even kind of fun haha. I am in college and I slide it right beside my bed and I keep a bunch of stuff on it, since it has three layers. I originally bought it and had my PS4 on it and used the top for a dinner tray if that helps anyone hahaha. Perfect for what I needed, it's small enough and was super easy to assemble. Veey straight forward. The poles are plastic, it works for me because I'm not going to put much on it but if you want something for heavier items it might not be ideal This shelf is the perfect size for where i wanted one. Areas for storage, just the right height. Very pleased at how well it works. Very easy to assemble, with options to change color: white/black to black/white, or whichever color you've purchased. These are cute and super simple to put together....all the parts screw together....I bought them to put in the bathrooms to store towels on.... but other uses are many....like speaker stands....printer stand.....plant stand.....ect..... the shelves are black on one side white on the other and its up to you to arrange your color skeem....they are reversiable....and very sturdy.....great buy really Moved too a new place needed two night stands on the cheap. All the cheap night stands looked super short except this one so i went with two of these. Works just fine screw it together tight and put it on a flat surface and thats it. Plenty tall for a 14\" platform bed with a 8\" mattress, comes maybe an inch or two higher than everything total. I'm actually getting a taller mattress maybe a 10\" or 12\" and these should still be tall enough which was my primary concern so I thought I'd leave a review for anyone else like me. I could not be more pleased with this item; it is exactly what I was looking for. It is the perfect companion to sit by a chair for putting your coffee or a beverage or your phone with a second shelf for maybe your book. Highly recommend it based on your needs. It is a quality product. The shelf panels did come scratched up and chipped, and the sticker removed part of the paper top when I took it off. I had extra contact paper to cover the shelves, so it looks fine, but don't expect a beautiful product without a little DIY. The white color is also pretty dull, so it looks cheaper. The assembly was less than five minutes, and everything screwed on tightly and wasn't wobbly. Overall, the table can definitely be modified to look better, and for $15 it's great. Great value for the price. Don't expect this to be an heirloom piece and you'll be fine. When I first saw them  I thought no way, too cheese. I put them together anyway,, really like them. Easy to clean spills. I was looking for temporary side table and was searching for low price and I got this. So price was so low than didnt have to give 2nd thought ", "It\u2019s perfect for what I needed as a side table for my bed, I literally put it together in 1 minute without looking at the directions it\u2019s that self explanatory. The tubes holding it up are a little cheaper looking than I was hoping but you really can\u2019t beat this price. It\u2019s a perfect addition to my studio apartment! For the money, this is a great little side table. Super easy to assemble and it's perfect for a small space. I didn't give the sturdiness 5 starts because of the height and how skinny it is. I have mine against the wall so it seems pretty solid. If it wasn't I feel it might get a little wobbly depending on what's put on it. One of the two I ordered came damaged. A descent less expensive bedside table.  I purchased 2, the one was a little knicked, but the second one was perfect.  I will just use some touch up paint on the knicked sides.  Overall, nice for $15.  And it really only took 10 mins to assemble,  just like the instructions stated!!! I rent an apartment with other peopler (we're all students), so my space and budget are limited. I was primarily looking for something to hold my makeup and printer, and this fit my budget and needs. My printer sits perfectly on top, and I even have space for books underneath. I had read some people had complaints with the sturdiness of the tables, but I think they're very well built, especially for this price point. If you're on a budget, this is definitely worth the price. I just wanted a functional and affordable nightstand and this fit the bill well. It was easy to put together and I mean there are some scuffs around some parts but as an 18 yr old who just wants cheap, I don\u2019t mind at all. I plan on getting a basket to put on the bottom shelf. Each shelf holds 10 lbs maximum. Really did only take 10 minutes to put together by myself. I would totally by another one if I needed to for whatever reason. Very easy to put together (no tools required) and they look great! I'm using them in my guestroom which doesn't have a lot of space and these fit on either side of the bed with no problems. They don't have a cheap look to them and I already bought another for a different room in my house. Overall pretty good. Very easy to assemble in less than 5 minutes. Worked well for what I needed, nice and tall for my bed which is on a frame, with a 12-inch mattress and a topper. Not incredibly sturdy but I really only need it to hold a cup, tv remote, phone and glasses while I sleep. Pretty cute, I like the black and white reversable design and it matches my black and white desk. Pretty much all the edges of every shelf are scratched but for $15 I don't really mind all that much, you could probably fix it with some black marker. Good little table for the money! The appearance is nice and the table is small enough to fit in small areas. Make sure you know the measurements needed since it is small and short.  Came next day and packaged in a typical. Good product for the price. This would have been perfect except for when I tried to remove the sticker label, the paint came off. I wish the other side was white, too, so I could've just flipped it over but the other side is black. For the price, I'm not surprised but disappointed. ", "I would have given it 5 stars but one of the corners on both of shelves were damaged on the black side. I had to put the white side up but would have liked to be able to use the black side. But overall, this table is worth the money. Easy to assemble -- just took minutes and it is sturdy. I am not sure if the dimensions shown on the description are correct.  Once assembled, this table is tiny.  Think phone book in terms of the size of the top.  Way too small to be useful.  Also made from cheap plastic.  Basically like kid's toys.  I cannot recommend it.  I will hand it to them, it is easy to assemble. These tables were a nice surprise didn't expect much for the price . But they are  pretty sturdy have a nice finish and easy to put together very happy with the purchase This is a perfect small little table! I use it next to my bed for a small lamp, my kindle, and my phone & charger. On the 2nd shelf I can put medicine and lotion. Then the bottom shelf is tall enough to put decorations. It's really cute, perfect for the price, and best part it takes MAYBE 5 minutes to put together- no tools required!! Very cheap, looks good from afar. Flimsy to use. I bought it as part of set dressing for a video and it worked great as that. We were able to put a few light items on the table, but I wouldn't trust it with too much weight and long term use. Good as a temporary table if you're in a pinch. Quick to put together. Company sent wrong color shelf, I guess there is something to the old brick and mortar stores, at least you see what your getting. This thing is ridiculously cheap, and it works perfectly apart from having 0 design for leveling the feet of the table. I love it, I also love laughing at its cheeeeaaaaaaap plastic tubes. Its wonderful as a remote table for a recliner and a tribute to niche capitalism. Awesome Product !!! Got it while an offer was going on, pretty cheap. Came in a small well packaged box. Easy to assemble, took less than 10 mins to fix. The side table is sturdy with good build quality. The height is proper too and got well adjusted with the bed frame. Small and perfect to use as a bedside table!! It\u2019s not fashionable, but it definitely gets the job done if you don\u2019t care about looks. Doesn\u2019t take up a ton of room but still allows more shelf space for small odds and ends that need a home. Also SO EASY to put together. No screws, no tools needed, and assembled in 5 minutes. Highly recommend if you just need something small and practical!!! This is just too cute. I ordered this end table for s nice accent table to decorate with pictures,nic-nacs and books. My sister made fun of it when she saw how small the box that it came in till I assembled it now she likes it a lot. ", "I received this table yesterday, and hadn't owned it for more than 15 minutes before I had it assembled and in use. I was having a bad arthritis day in my hands, and it couldn't have gone easier. It's the perfect size and height for my needs. It looks like a $15 table, and it feels sturdy enough so far. I'm already contemplating buying another one. Super easy to put together and its cute from afar. Mine arrived with damage to one of the shelves so had to figure out a way to hide that since I didn't realize it was damaged until it was almost put together but for the money, its ok. Just what i was looking for to use in a very small space in bedroom for cpap machine and other items. It was so easy to put together even for me with health issues. No tools needed. It's very sturdy and looks very very nice. Love it. I'm using the table on my backyard patio as an herb stand and for assorted related sundries. The drill holes were all correctly aligned and assembly took under 5 minutes. So far it has held up just fine to NW weather, rain (it's semi-sheltered) and sun alike; though I'll bring it inside or somewhere completely sheltered during the worst of the winter. Not something one would want next to Louis XIV antiques, but perfect for a child's, teen's, or student's room, a home on the coast; or again, as a casual piece just about anywhere in the house. None This table was very inexpensive. It's made from cheap materials but it manages to be pretty sturdy. It looks nice and fits small spaces which is what I needed it for. You can put it together in 5 minutes with no tools. I'm a happy customer. Product was super easy to assemble and is a good value for the money. It's not the highest quality but is acceptable for my needs and looks better than I was expecting. You have a choice of either a white top surface or a dark/black top surface. It's good if you need a table stand to fill up space and solely for looks, but I would not be comfortable putting more than a couple picture frames on it.  It is not sturdy at all, the boards and very flimsy, and the pieces do not screw together very well. I\u2019m super impressed. For the price, I excepted a POS. The shelves are wood and the \u201crods\u201d are plastic. It\u2019s really sturdy. I assembled it in like 8 mins. This is the best $10 I have ever spent on furniture.  I was able to assemble it in minutes.  It does a great job of holding a few items per shelf.  The most important of is the to shelf. It holds my remote and my beer. Is it a high quality metal and real wood end table.....no. it is a plastic and compressed wood cheapo. But, for ten bucks....it is awesome.....especially for something that showed up here without me knowing my drunk self ordered it! ", "With too much tech on our dining room table in an apartment with limited space, my wife said it\u2019s got to go! I bought this low profile table and it exceeded my expectations for what I had in mind. Probably not what it was designed for but with a little imagination you can make magic! These side tables are perfect for the spaces they were bought for.  The were delivered promptly and in perfect condition, and were easy to assemble.  Great value for the price! Extremely easy to assemble, no tools needed just like it's advertised! With that said IRS perfect for what I'm using it for.. bedside tables to hold a lamp, phone, and glasses on overnight. I dont think I'd use them to hold any actual weight for fear they wouldn't be sturdy enough. Was looking for a side table, and saw this on sale for less than $12. The first thing I noticed was how small and light the box packaging in came in was. Upon opening, I found that there were a few scratches on the board, so choose a nice one for the top! After a few weeks of use, I find that the edge paint are starting to pull from the sides.. not a great look. It gets pretty wobbly when I stack stuff on it, so don't think about anything too heavy. Well I guess this is a pretty cheap table so thats what you get! Hold our homework, dominoes, & other things that tend to get stores in the kitchen table. Just a little shorter than I anticipated, easy to put together (NO TOOLS NEEDED!!) I would have given it more stars but the name is WAY too long. Seriously, it\u2019s not a bad set of tables. Nothing amazing, just a decent couple of tables at a decent price. Table was packaged well and was super easy to put together, it took me maybe 10 minutes. I was afraid once I read some of the negative reviews that it would be trash but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a decent little table for small spaces. Very pleasantly surprised! It was shorter than I had expected but that\u2019s completely my fault for not paying attention to the measurements. It took me about a minute to put it together, and I was very shocked by how sturdy it is. I love it! I've had other furniture in this brand and it wasn't as chintzy as this was. We're using it as a night stand for my young son. The tubes are soft plastic and not solid like others. One of the labeling stickers I tried to peel off actually took the top coat off with it, like it was covered in paper not paint on real wood pieces. It's very small and it took me 5 minutes to assemble. It also looks quite good and elegant in you want to go for a minimalist look. It doesn't look very sturdy, but it's stable so I'm not complaining about it. Cheapest in the market and pretty good. ", "I really like this side table but don't expect something expensive. It has hollow plastic pipe legs.  But it's cute, sturdy, and I like how the wood looks. 1 board had some weird line marks but i just put that one the bottom shelf. I needed a small table by my bedside for my CPAP machine and this was perfect. The shelf underneath the top even allows me to store books I read before falling asleep. It assembled in 10 minutes. They recommend a maximum of 10 lbs. per shelf, and it is easily sturdy enough to handle it. I like this table very much and it is very cute! It could be better in a few areas...but...for under $20, I will take it! Nothing was broken or scratched and it was a breeze to put together. I would buy it again because it\u2019s what I was expecting for the price. Space saver. Sturdy enough. Good end table. Is reversible. You can put white or black.

It appears you can change the height of each shelf with the posts if you want them to be smaller or larger. Just received a week ago so no complaints yet. Perfect for limited small space.  Perfect for child's bedside.  Arrived earlier than projected.  This is my third purchase of this item.  I wanted my grandson's to have it for their bedside.  Verr pleased with this purchase. This little table is perfect for speakers or just a lil table beside an accent chair. Super easy to put together & seems sturdy. A couple of little marks but overall I'm very happy with it. Would recommend! Firstly, this was so easy to put together. At first when I bought it I thought I'd have to use all three (3) shelves, but I could make this a 2-shelf side table. Worked out perfectly bc my bed is so low. Great for small spaces. It's nothing fancy, but it's great for what it is. It's pretty easy to put together (and I'm NOT the most handy person, so if I can figure it out, I figure most ANYONE can) and is a good fit for my small bedroom. There were a few surface scratches on the item received out of the box, but not really enough to complain about. The fact that you can choose between the black or white side made it so I just put the scratched side down. All in all, pleased with my purchase! Obviously this isn't the highest quality table, the shelves are particle board and the posts/legs are made of plastic, but I just needed a small table I could put bedside to set my phone and a few other things on and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. Was super easy to put together and only took a few minutes. Doesn't look bad for what it is! ", "I needed a cheap end table to go next to some futons which are relatively low to the ground.

It\u2019s very inexpensive so know that and don\u2019t expect much. It\u2019s small. One part arrived damaged. Clearly packed that way. I want a refund. It's strong enough to hold 45 pounds on the bottom shelf and 35 pounds on the upper-shelves as per it's instructions. I would say that's accurate. I bought one for a hidden night table. It's not attractive enough--in my opinion--to be a main night-table in a room that you're try to make aesthetically pleasing. It's a winner for that small bedroom--on the wall side--where it spans just eleven inches wide on its smallest side. was very easy to put together with out tools....study enough for what i need it in my small bedroom corner next to my bed I had the choice of what color I wanted to show white or black...using it for my CPAP machine fit perfect for it and have my night stand open for space now. this shelf  i put plastic small baskets for small items on  it.

This was a great purchase for our college kid who need some extra surfaces.  I put it together quickly and it's solid.  She loves it ordered this table & paid $15.10. went to order another one & price increased to $20.62 in a matter of days! why all of a sudden the price increase? it's a great little table & would actually order another! This table is pretty cute all around. Super easy to assemble; you literally just screw the rods together and \u201cvoila!\u201d. i think ive had water bottles with less cheap plastic than the pillars in this lol. The main reason i dropped two stars though was the terrible formaldehyde/chemical smell. I probably lost a year of my life after inhaling immediately after opening the box. I left it in a corner of my room to offgas for a few weeks and it seems to be better now as far as odors go though it's for my guest bedroom so i cant comment on whether itll leave a smell on items left on it regularly since i dont use it often. I bought three, all at different times, and use them in closets under the bottom shelves.  They keep items handy and off the floor. They go together almost without thought and are very sturdy.  I'm a 77 year old female and am very happy with purchases. I'd give 10 stars if I could. Super easy and you need zero tools to put this together. No experience required.

This is the second table I purchased. I got one a few months back and it's going to arrive scuffed and marred. I contacted Amazon but they want me to jump through hoops to replace it down the way that I wasted 20 minutes of my life on the phone for nothing so I'm just going to paint it. With working from home, I needed a simple shelf in my office, but I didn't want to spend major bucks. This thing has super easy assembly, and I mean super, super easy. And it's very sturdy as well.

Cute little stand that can be used in a variety of ways. The material is very sturdy. I have mine on carpet and no issues I put this together in a few minutes and I am an 82 year old woman. No tools. I am using it next to my TV stand. I put a radio on this table which acts as a speaker for my cd player which no longer could fit on the TV stand after getting a 43\" TV. These things are so flimsy,  won't use them to support anything worthwhile Great for a small apartment Perfect as a stand for my electronics in my music room. I play jazz guitar and use this to Boise my iPad and other electronics while I play and create. Study and simple to assemble. Well worth the buy!! It is a simple and cheap nightstand. Just needed something to hold a couple of books, reading glasses and a few other lightweight items, and needed it to fit in a very small space. I wouldn't recommend it for holding anything fragile or heavy, but it is exactly what we needed. It did exactly the job I needed it to do so I am happy with it, however, it\u2019s not sturdy (hence the super low cost) and I do find it somewhat chunky for small spaces. But it\u2019s not an eyesore and works great for an extra temporary small table. Very nice little table for a good price. Needed something for my small older bathroom and this fits in there perfectly and now I'm able to organize my electric razor, alexa, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, towels, cleaning supplies, paper towels, toilet paper, & magazines. Probably going to buy more because they're such a great deal ", "I bought two products from this company and they sell tiny little desks. Not sure who would ever need something this small. Not as expected, too busy to repack and return. I guess  thats how they make money from people who cant find time to return. Is this a nice piece of furniture? No, don't be stupid. It's kind of ugly and it feels cheap. The \"veneer\" is put on kind of shabbily and isn't very nice looking anyway. The legs are hollow plastic and it's wobbly. That being said, if you put it in a place that's out of the way and not very visible, it will hold things up, and I suppose that's about as much as you can expect for 15 dollars. i bought this to use as a stand for my laptop next to my bed, works great for that, not as sturdy as it should be, the top could be flush but instead they went with domed tops which kinda makes the top useless if you need it to be absolutely flat or want to put anything on the corners. Not bad smaller then what I expected to be honest but will be buying more and other products! These products are for is who can't stand and or patience for a crazy assemble this was quick took me 5 min to put together Remember this is a $13 end table. It's plastic, partical board, and the laminate is not well done. I needed it as a small end table to hold a small UPS, modem, and mesh router. The looks are cheap but it works. This little table is exactly what we were looking for. It was very quick and easy to put together, fits great in the tight space we needed it in, and holds what we needed it to hold with no concerns. Super easy to put together and easy to follow directions too! For the price it's a steal, the supports are plastic, but it looks great and is surprisingly sturdy I like this table, small and cute! Easy to assemble, what make me unhappy is after I moved the stick on the board! It also moved the paint! If you want to buy it , I suggest just keep it there! A very nice little stand. Nothing big, but it was perfect for getting some of my home network gear organised. I've got my modem, router, and NAS on it and all the cable management routed down the back of the legs via cable ties. It was a perfect fit for my needs and freed up some space in my living room. ", "It\u2019s nice. Others who have seen it tell me it is ugly, but I think it\u2019s fine. The only issue I had was the plastic tubes have poorly molded threading which makes it hard to screw together. Once I got it together by force, it felt sturdy. This is a great little table.  Very easy to assemble, believe me, I am the worst at assembling things.  From the time I cracked open the box until I was finished - 10 min. tops.  Fits perfectly for where I wanted to put it.  I will be buying another one in a different color.  Love it. Its working out for me just needed a extra stand to put my phone and eye glasses so I could access them easily. Did not know it was going to be so small tho but I like it more space in my bed room. This was easy enough to put together. It is every light and easy to move. Looks and feels cheap. But considering the price makes sense. After about 6 months this thing was broken. I thought I should advantage of the reversible feature and flip the color of the shelves. As i took it apart, because of the cheap plastic, it broke at the screw. This end table is perfect. I was looking for a small table to put next to my bed and this does the job just fine. It's doesn't look bulky or awkward in the bedroom and having three tiers to organize stuff from is very convenient. Extremely lightweight, but sturdy. Good purchase.

Parts came in good condition. Sturdy. Fits my cd calendar and desk fan perfect! When I start my semester I know it\u2019s going to be perfect for books to be placed. Easy to set up as well. Can\u2019t go wrong. I needed a simple shelf for my son's bedroom and these did the job. They are super duper easy to assemble they took 5 minutes to put together.

Dont know about the long run, but right now it looks great, has a bit of not so perfect edges and paint, but its something that I wont care too much about. Is this fine furniture? Absolutely not, but it doesn't claim to be. It is actually pretty sturdy considering how cheap it is.

Would not buy this again. Almost falling apart after a couple of weeks. Honestly, a really good table! Came with easy instructions and looks nice. I assembled it in 10ish minutes.

Not exactly as expected but good for the space. I like the levels and the different color options. The legs are plastic tubes, so sturdiness is iffy. But how much heaviness can you put on a side table. Really nice stand for the money. I moved and had to put my tv on my dresser, my backup battery would not reach to plug my tv in. This worked perfectly. I also fit my Blu-ray player in the middle and my subwoofer on the bottom. Love this stand. First off I would like to say it is a bit smaller than I expected it to be even after looking at the measurements, but it is still a great little side table. The three tier shelf is amazing to put small things on it so I would def recommend. Not great furniture but for the $13 I paid works very well.

Gotta hand it to the design team on this one, Bravo! Looks nice and is easy to assemble. Looks fancy from a far, not so much up close. I got two of these tables for nightstands and I love them.

Pretty easy to assemble and great for small spaces So easy to set up and looks great. Table serves its purpose.  Very low quality but I guess you get what you paid for. This end table is ok looking and is at a good height, but it is definitely not well built. But for the price it's great, and if one side gets ruined being able to switch the sides of the surfaces is nice. Perfect It was great!!! Looks amazing! The only little issue I have is the poles look very cheap. But it doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s small and perfect for small spaces. Pretty easy to assemble.

Perfect for a small place. Bought 3 of them. Very easy to put together. Nice lil simple look. Good product! I do not like how small it is and barely fits anything on the middle shelf My wife has expressed her satisfaction with this product and I am merely a messenger. just the right size Cute table ...have four in the theater room between chairs and will order two more to go in the guest room near the bead. Like the three shelves, a good deal for the size. Not the height advertised Easy to assemble sits right by my bed and meets my needs ", "This was very unfortunate. I was so excited about these side tables and then when I opened the first one and began taking off the sticker...it peeled the paint/fabric underneath. Must there be a sticker on an item like this when there is room for errors like this?! I\u2019m disappointed. This is exactly what I needed for a small, affordable bedside table.

Square Table Top is veneer in black on composite wood with metal black coating for base. Table size 23.7-Inch Square by 35-Inch high. Easy Assembly.\n\n"}, "Reviews": ["Great product, easy assemble n very sturdy. Perfect for 1-2 person. Fast delivery too None Table is working for what I need which is to move my printer off of my primary desk space.  Beware....the pole holding everything up does not bolt into either the table or the base.  It just slides into a preset space.  Because of that it will rock and shift around.  It really isn't stable overall.  I have it in a corner with a desk on either side of it so the wobbling when I'm actually printing something doesn't bother me that much.  But if you want to use this out in an open area where it could be leaned on or if it has an uneven balance of items on it I would not buy it. So I was reading the reviews AFTER I ordered the table. People were making me nervous with the \"top doesn't stay on\" or \"top is wobbling\". Guys donr panic!!! My husband opened the box and said it's a Press Fit design. Essentially you have to press the stand into the top. He lightly hammered the table leg while it was upside down on the hard tile floor. Does budge and looks great. Perfect for 2 people. Would definitely buy again as long as my husband's around haha Very cute, practical for the price point, high top table. Was super easy assembly wise, am a 120 pound lady and did this by myself.. so you'll be fine. The table does what it said it would do.  Its a small square table that has weight to it so it won't tip over easily.  The only tools you need for assembly are a screw driver to attach the table top to the support.  It comes in a flat box and is in 5 pieces.  It is only a small pub table so I strongly suggest not letting anyone sit on top of it.  It is good for two people to eat breakfast but not really big enough for two laptops to work comfortably. It works for the break room at our shop, however there was minor tweaking done to keep the top sturdy and from shifting side to side.  Bolts had to be screwed through the bottom (not provided)  into the stand.  Easy remedy- but beware if you dont have or want to deal with that. Decided to order this table which I did but on the way to me I canceled the order Based on Some of the reviews (good) had nice set ups from pictures shown but was stated that they recommend not leaning or eating on it and (bad) the table was wobbly and wasn't sturdy enough to hold up I gave 3 stars just because even though I never set the table up I end up ordering another round dining table from another seller that best suited me I purchased this for my eat-in kitchen. The size is perfect for the space. It seems like there is a piece missing from the top of the table pole. It does not fit snuggly into the table top. As a result, the top WILL wobble. A lot of other reviewers noted this feature too so don't shrug it off -- know that your table WILL wobble. I contacted the seller for a new pole hoping maybe they'd send me one with a top piece, but they just sent the exact same piece. Instead of returning it and buying a new table from someone else, I fixed this by putting black electrical tape around the top of the pole, malleting the pole into the table top as far as it would go, and then securing it there with some more electrical tape. It got the job done, the table no longer wobbles, and you can't tell the tape is there because it blends with the table. My boyfriend and I live and Hawai\u2019i and let me tell you how difficult it is to shop for furniture! Not only are we restricted to limited amount of furniture stores but because of shipping, furniture prices here are outrageous! I\u2019m so glad Amazon is around bc we found just what we were looking for! Not only was it prefect but the price is so affordable! We\u2019re completely I love with our table and how it perfectly matches the stools we also bought on amazon! Table is just as pictured, size is exact and install was super easy. You can put this table together in under 10mins without needed tools. It\u2019s super sturdy and color is beautiful. Came in perfect condition. ", "It looks fantastic. Was well packaged. The material is quality. Easy to put together (I did it in under 5 minutes). But it's not stable... there is no hardware to keep the bottom or top piece in place or attached, you just kind of have to shove it in there. My husband wanted a small table to match our bar stools and this was perfect. Perfect height. Very stable. Good value for a light-duty cafe table.  It is very easily tippable with only a finger tip of effort.  The table top is connected to the post, but the post just rests in the base, not bolted or anything.  It's very lightweight.  I got it for the kitchen, but only for \"hang out and chat with the person cooking, or drink coffee and play on tablet.\"  I would NOT recommend this for having meals on (lest someone move wrong and send all the dishes and cups careening to the floor).  Base and pole are metal, top is particle board.  Securely packaged and arrived on time. We have a small kitchen in our 120 year old townhome.  I went through many tables and wanted 24\" square over 24\" circle diameter for the additional surface area.  Love it!  Almost didn't buy due to misinformation in regard to inaccurate base size in specs. I feel this is a tad overpriced when considering circular tables of a 24\" diameter actually had the ability to adjust height and revolve similar to a lazy cost $20 less.  Really didn't have any use for those percs and most were chrome look where we wanted black base. The table was exactly what I expected. Easy to assemble. I placed the table on carpet so it wasn\u2019t very stable so had to move it to position one side on a wall which stabilized it.  I\u2019m sure on hard surface it would be okay. Great little table! Space saver. Easy to assemble. Light weight. Perfect for our needs. Arrived super fast in good condition! Might order a second one. 2nd one bought, first one returned defective. Very difficult to keep top from not moving with pressure. Easy assembly, but base and top do not fit correctly on long tube stand. Directions are horrible. You will need a rubber mallet A really good item, and looks great!  The only reason why I gave it four stars is because it was a little lower than I thought.  With bar stools, it just made it harder to sit comfortably with your legs under the table.  So just make sure your chairs are a sufficient height to avoid this problem.  Other than that, it's also pretty sturdy without a lot of rockiness. Bought two for my pool room. Light weight and easy to move and assemble. Cheap price and they are sturdy. I like that the stands are thick and substantial. This is a nice little table & perfect size for me but the base would not fit tight at the top. I used some black tape to make it snugger and taped around the bar to solve the problem but take points off for that product flaw. Other than that glitch it is a nice sturdy table with large enough base to keep it from tipping over too easily. ", "It's a perfect table for a perfect small space area. I created a bar area and it worked great I needed a counter height table. It\u2019s a little wobbly and the table top looks like it will scratch easily. Table definitely needs to be anchored somehow. Just a basic table for a basic price..nothing good or bad about it. We bought these tables to put in our sanctuary at church. They are just the right height, perfect for people to walk up to, take communion and make an offering. They were very easy to put together and have held up well. Its cheap and simple and probably worth about the price its listed as.  Using this as a breakfast table in the kitchen.  Only gripe would be the lack of solid attachment from the table top to the pole to the base.  It uses friction fittings/the weight of the table to keep it connected. Don't try picking it up! There so wobbly and the base is not what I expected it's ok it does the job. I know I will need something in the near future because it's not sturdy to table just sits on top. Although the first one was stripped they did send me another fairly quickly but it wasn't to much better it does the job I rarely ever leave reviews, but I couldn\u2019t even set this up because it was missing the bolts, mounting plate, metal washers, and hex wrench. I am really disappointed because now, I have to go out of my way to submit paperwork to receive the missing pieces. This was very inconvenient as I needed to use this ASAP. Good solid table for the price.  The height is awkward.  Its too short to be a regular table and not quite tall enough to be a bar table.  Strange design.  You'll need a height adjustable bar stool to pair with this table. Fantastic table. A little shorter than a traditional bar table but it works perfectly for what I needed. The dimensions are in the item description so be sure the height will work. Seems to be reasonable quality for the price. Nice table but it got scratched the first day of use. Reccomend buying something to protect the cheap plastic top. ", "The table top wobbles with moderate weight to the sides.  The table lacks a mechanism to lock the table top in place to prevent the movement.  Would not recommend. Love it for my small kitchen Easy to assemble and take apart. I wish there was a way to lock the lights table board so it doesn\u2019t pop of easily when moving the table. Does the job. Only dislike is the table detaches from the stand since there\u2019s nothing to hold it in place Really easy to put together. However, very wobbly.. not sturdy and not the best to eat on.. Extremly wobbly and unstable. One unit had a small problem to begin with, and with light use over 3 months 2 others are now unstable. Light use is 5 people a day having coffee at the table. Very nice table ... Very easy assembly , it took longer to unpack than it did to assemble . 4 bolts and an allen wrench (which is included) . Very satisfied with the purchase ...\u2079 Ok Wish it was a little taller and more stable... There's no way to fasten the top ot bottom, they just press in The table is just a tad wabbaly but it will work for me, could be easy fix. Material is solid and sturdy. I bought a used one btw. I\u2019m overal happy and looks great at my place. At least I think it does lol ... HOOKAH TABLE LOL ;) ", "Table was very easy and quick to assemble. I have it cornered between wall & kitchen counter, so it's quite stable. Very happy with this purchase. The table was purchased for a flexible seating option in my classroom. The height worked perfectly with my stools. Unfortunately, it can with small scratches one the table top and one scratch craved in deep. Hermosa None Has this going on 2 years still in great condition. Seats still go up and down, and my kids still spins in it. These are great tables for a great price. We use them in our church lobby/welcome area for refreshment time, sign-ins, displays. They are good quality and nice looking. I cannot speak to the sturdiness for use in a high traffic eating/drinking establishment. Very happy with the product. Works great! Sturdy and flat. Not too heavy. Wish the bottom was a bit more secure but shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Sturdy The top of this table is hard to keep clean and it shows marks even after being cleaned whether especially from drinks.  Most importantly it is not sturdy.  The top of the table does not fit into the base and it is wobbly. Easy to assemble and looks very chic in our office.  I used it to set up a coffee service area, and have a Mind Reader service set on top of it.  We don't use this heavily, or for leaning on or eating at, so it has really served its purpose. Its also easy to clean. Arrived safely and secure, and from the time I opened the box, it took about 10 minutes to unpack the parts and get the entire table put together.  So far it's a great complement to the bar space in my home. No complaints at all, especially for the price. ", "Probably the best thing I can say about this product is 5 minutes or less of set-up time. That is awesome for this kind of furniture. Great value We are using this in our coffee shop and we love it. Well made. I just wanted a little pub table for extra seating when entertaining g. It\u2019s perfect- and I worried about the sturdiness being on carpet but it\u2019s great! Impossible to get level.  Other than that a good table for the price. Not the most stable on carpet. Very easy to assemble but there is no way to secure it from spinning. But as long as you have enough weight on it, it is a very functional table.  It serves our need for a breakfast nook type table Gets the job done, easy assembly, good size, not wobbly on my carpet and everything as advertised Easily chipped on corners as it is made of particle board, tippy as pole is not secured into base. Took five minutes to put together three pieces that can separate real quick if you need to move or relocate. Product is as described and incredible by for the money Good height. Kinda wobbly.  But got what I paid for. ", "Somewhat wobbly...but a great price for the product. Easy to assemble. Easy to assemble Great size for two people Totally understand the bad reviews it was not as strong as I expected then they refused my refund but otherwise it was what I was looking for so I had to make it work so for those of you in my shoes I used some cleverly place Ed Styrofoam and cardboard in the bottom of table where the pole is inserted you will need to be very strong to do this for the type of stability I was looking for or need to have multiple people with you to help insert the table pole and feet it needs to be so tight that the pole technically doesn't fit and you have to force it in in my case I used my children turn the table upside down we all piled on top and successfully inserted the table Pole once I did that I checked for security I've had it for several months now and have been using it for my Mac which is why I purchased it and needed it to be stable my Mac has never fallen table has never tipped over and I've had zero problems with it since I use that method to stabilize the table. I should mention though that it is also placed and a corner against one wall and a couch arm so I'm sure that gives it some stability. This is a really nice table for the price its a steal. It is very sturdy. Very easy to assemble...you can assemble in under 10 mins...it takes longer to get it out of the package.. The table top is a little heavy and the stand and base are also durable, I am very happy with these tables..I am using them in my beauty salon...they look nice...the only issue is I ordered 3 of them and one of them came with a missing screw It\u2019s not sturdy and it\u2019s not straight Looks great Perfect for my store! Arrived quickly and damage free While I am in love with the way the table looks, it is a bit wobbly, and doesn\u2019t seem to be very secure. Assembly was very easy only 4 screws and 4 washers, they even gave you the Allen Key to build it. Awful quality. Do not buy this if you're planning to use it often. Table top wiggles in the pole and is not sturdy for eating on. Disappointed. ", "Good for the price you pay. This is not stable. It\u2019s a good table for the price, but the washers to assemble were just thrown loose in the box. The table also has a bit of a wobble. Totally worth the price . Easy to assemble and looks really good . I got the chairs too they are a good deal , most home stores sell one for about 100$  came really quick its nice for the price, the base could stand to be a little bit heavier, to keep anyone from pulling it over but its doing the job for me. I like it. It does the job, but it could be more sturdy; the table top also doesn't sit level on the stand. amazing great product Pretty good Excelente para \u00e1reas peque\u00f1as. None Very small short table that does not fit together properly. The top is very loose. I would not buy this. Simple assembly. Sturdy table, but I wouldn't use it in a commercial setting.

It\u2019s so cute in my kitchen with my two bar stools. its rocky it doesn't stay in place Exceeded my expectations.  Fast shipping too. This table is just what I needed. It's just the right hieght (35\") for the chairs I have (22\") Although the top is small (23.5\"), it's perfect for a couple of drinks and nosh while watching the sunset in my sunroom. Brought it for my son's studio apt and it's perfect. My daughter assembled it. The two tables I purchased are wobbly. They aren't trustworthy enough to put food and drink onto, but they would be too much bother to return. Oh well, next garage sale and they're gone. False advertisement. Not happy with this purchase. Table is too small and is wobbly I  love this table! :) This table was very easy to assemble. But I wish the top part could just stay still. I love it goes great with my chairs I brought from Ross ", "easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks great Nice table but not very sturdy. The top wobles and I still haven't found chairs for it The table looks nice but, the top does not attach properly so the table is very wobbly...\u2026... Using as teaching table.  Fits computer, paper and a little more.  Perfect! Received this table promptly and packaged extremely well.  It was easy to put together and seems to be very sturdy so far.  The smaller table surface is perfect for just sitting and having a drink or light meal and the height matches that of my kitchen counter.  Would definitely recommend. Looks great! well constructed!! Quality isn't there. The table is not able to support a lot of weight and the one I purchased cracked after it was leaned on. The top is NOT fastened to the pole. It just sits down on it. Without being fastened, it will rock back and forth ,... not stable at all. Pretty.  Fits in space.  But I can't seem to get the table top to stay steady.  Doesn't make the table unusable but it definitely takes away from the full experience. Will do the job, but not leveled ", "A great little inexpensive table! And super service by this seller! Absolutely terrible. Awful quality Great for what I wanted !!! Little wobbly but good for the price Table is wobbly It's okay. It arrived on time and looks just like the picture. My main issue is that one of the screws didn't even fit into one of the holes correctly, so I only have 3 screws holding the top to the center pole. It's a bit off-putting knowing that it isn't as secure as it should be We have had two months. Very light use and table top is extremely scratched This item is very short for a \"bar table\". With bar stools, Nice table but the nail that is supposed to be secure in the middle is too short. I had to purchase a longer one Very nice and sturdy ", "Not stable. Perfect for my small kitchen. Great value! Perfect size for 2 Exactly what I wanted The table did not come with all the nuts and bolts so we had to fit bolts to the best of our ability. The table has started to wobble now but does fine since it is just for our back porch. It fits with bar stools, and was pretty easy to assemble. The top of the table does scratch very easily though. A little better quality than I expected at that price.  Easy to assemble. Love the metal base, although the top needs to be better quality. Well made Reasonably priced. Feels like it's missing a part for how wobbly it is. Easy to put together and looks pretty good but low functionality. ", "wobbles not very secure made cheap but good for the price. For the price, you can't beat it.  It works great as a little bistro side table in our kitchen, with a couple of bar stools. Item arrived perfect condition and quickly. Very sturdy even on carpet. Table top and base fit very snug. Was perfect for stools I purchased. Great height for what I needed to do Not sturdy and short A little wobbly Easy to put together, but the tabletop is a little wobbly. good product OK Great ", "very nice I did not realize it was counter height, not bar height. As other reviews have stated, it is a \"counter height table.\" Not as tall as a Pub table, but it will work just fine for it's purpose. Easy to set up and break down. Great small table! Very nice I bought it for my husband so that he can have a place to set up his chess board.  Fits perfectly in our basement. Muy buenos The table is okay, but there was this horrible safety sticker on it that took about an hour and a half to completely remove. That was extremely frustrating Its small, its clean looking, the top isn't obviously pressboard painted black.  Could use a boot ring on the bottom as the tapering to stick it into the base is too long for how deep it goes in, very minor. I really like the look and quality of this \"high\" table.  However, this table isn't high. Its about 35\" tall. It's counter height. This is by no means a bar height table. If you're looking for something tall this is NOT it. After inspecting the build you could easily raise the table if you wanted a few extra inches in height. (longer screws/spacers) Also the pedestal has some play but nothing a wedge can't fix. Overall, I really like this table. Works well with higher type chairs. Even though this Isn't very tall its certainly taller then a normal table. Included is a picture of the way mine looks. I'll be purchasing another one to go next to it against the wall. ", "I love this table! I bought it to go in the corner of my family room.  It fits my bar stools perfect.  It looks really nice. No scratches.  The material looks really expensive even though I didn't pay much.  It doesn't wobble on my carpet or move.  It's really sturdy. I'm so glad I purchased this table.  I am a super happy customer.  I took back the other table I had purchase because it wasn't made for carpet. Pros: I like the table, but cannot get the top and base to fit snuggly on the post and because of that it is wobbly. Very wobbly. I would not use it for food. Slightly too short. Tops are lose when you move them Very easy to put together and looks amazing. The only problem is that the table top doesn't secure and wobbles. I got this table for my studio apartment and it fits great.  It's small enough to walk around and fits well with my bar stools.  If it were 3 inches higher it would be perfect! This table was literally perfect for me. Remember it very small but this was what I wanted for my one bedroom apartment. Very satisfied. It was just as described and it was super easy to put together. We all love it and use it for various things. ", "Great, very happy Pros: Easy assembly, size good for one or two people Not as sturdy as I thought it would be, the top leans to what ever side I apply pressure too This is a nice black counter height table.  Every piece was individually wrapped and I didn't need any tools other than the L wrench they provided. It was  together in a matter of minutes and is extremely sturdy and is the perfect height for my bar stools. It is lightweight and easy to move. Easy to put together and looks great. Chips very easily It's ok.  Not very sturdy These tables were simple to put together, they look great and they were a good price. Table is wobbly and it is much smaller than described. great table for the price ", "I purchased this and stools great product very sturdy and out of ten tables its only missing a washer for one of the screws Decent table for the price. We loved it all! Pricing was great! And was delivered in 3 days very fast! Perfect for our finished basement! Wobbly Works as intended, great for Nook or smaller area. It does rock kind of easily on tile floor when leaning in with elbows on it because of pedestal foot. Love the design and size. The quality is questionable. The table top wobbled side to side until I had to stuff a paper towel in the hole before inserting the pole. The table top also chips easily. Mine already has a few nicks and I am very easy on it. The size and design is great for what I was looking for; however, the quality is obviously bad. Perfect Great table, though not entirely stable. Good for the price Great table for the price!  The top is a little slippery. Love this table, nice addition to our basement for entertaining. ", "As expected. Would have liked to cut the leg off to match the height of my desk. Simple-easy to put together. Would have gave it a five star if I could have cut the leg off. But then it was I guess not suppose to be cut off. I liked the idea of this table. sitting at it on one of my bar stools puts my thighs right up to the bottom of the table, so it's like eating off my lap.  maybe that's the way they are supposed to be, but i was hoping it'd be a bit taller.  the quality seems fine for what it is though, it's a decent cheap table. This table is a little shorter than the comparable round table by Winsome, I have two round one's already. These are made in China if that matters to you. I use them in the Man cave. It doesn't stay together no screws to keep the bottom or top from moving. Not very well stable table. The table broke within weeks. Just out of principle I am going to get it replaced. I would NEVER purchase this again terrible quality. This was a pice of garbage I would not recommend this item it get broked instantly I had to add a piece of something to fix it Ultimately, this table is fine.  You should know, however, that the table construction consists of stacking three pieces on top of one another (the table surface goes on top of the pole on top of the base). There are no screws that keep the three parts together, so the table is quite wobbly as the pieces don't fit snugly into each other. I alleviated this by putting some duct tape around the inserting parts, and this eliminated most of the wobble in the table, but at the end of the day it is a cheap table. I was shopping for bar stools and bought a pair of the \"tall\" kitchen chairs I found locally for a great price.  I knew they were too short for the bar, but had to buy them. This is a solid little table perfect for 2 in our basement bar. It is counter height and goes perfectly with \"tall\" kitchen chairs...not bar Nice table and great for the samll area we were looking fro ", "Assembled very fast, 4 screws for the table top. Well made. I put two of these in the back of the home theatre and immediately increased sitting by an additional six persons. Post doesn't attach to the base...just sits in it...and to doesn't full attach to the post...literally unusable... LOVE LOVE LOVE this table. Very inexpensive but a good sized table which was very easy to assemble! Great for those living alone and also couples. love my table! gets the job done - but weirdly moves around a lot. the top piece isn't sturdy on the pole it's connected to. It's not as tall as a standard bar stool. But it works. Well constructed and practical - good value for the money. Has a small tilt if you put weight on one side. Very nice and was easy to assemble.

I figured I'd build a couple of stands to act as bass traps, and after pricing the wood I would need to make it happen, I realized I probably could do what I wanted cheaper by just modifying an end table. I got two of these for $15 each. I bought this table and used silcone to glue four 10x10 Lego plates to the top.  My son loves his new Lego table.  It was only $40 to contruct, much cheaper than \"official\" Lego tables out there. I got two of these to put next to each other as a table for our tortoise\u2019s 40 gallon terrarium.  I know they are super light weight but for what they are I think they are sturdy enough.  Especially distributing the weight amongst 8 legs, plus there\u2019s room underneath for our chihuahua\u2019s crate.  The price can\u2019t be beat and I would definitely buy more for future needs.  The legs are so easy to screw on and they feel tight and sturdy for being so lightweight. I sat on one when I was done putting on the legs to test it and it didn\u2019t wobble or feel like it was going to break so it really holds more than it looks like it would.  Fits perfectly in my space and I\u2019m happy with the purchase. I bought this to raise the height of my Black & Decker 2.7 cf mini refrigerator off of the ground.  This thing is super simple to setup, as all four legs have screws installed into the top of each table leg.  The bottom of the tabletop has four pre-drilled holes for the four table legs.  All that is needed to build it is to flip the tabletop upside and then screw in each of the four legs.  The mini-fridge weighs approximately 40 lbs and this end table has no issue supporting it that I can observe. Honestly a four year old could assemble these tables without help, and once they put them together they'd have a fairly difficult time destroying them, even if they used them as a ladder to reach something else. They are sturdy and the finish is beautiful, just watch out for the corners, I've already scratched up my knees a couple of times. Not a lot to see here.  Four legs and a piece of wood on top.  The legs come with screws already embedded.  You just screw in the legs, turn the table over, and you're done.  That's it. Look, this thing is $12 shipped.  You're getting what you pay for.  It's really light and I'm pretty sure the legs are hollow. Although made of particle board, can't beat these for the price. Sturdy, extremely easy to assemble and look very nice and perfect size to use as \"night stands\" alongside my new platform bed. I thought I should leave a review of this product seeing as I've just bought a second one this week and they are really nice end tables. The table is very sturdy and has a great finish, unlike some of the other inexpensive pieces I've bought in this color from other brands. Putting the table together is extremely simple: it's a top and four legs - all of which simply screw into the pre-drilled holes until snug and aligned with the corners. That's it. It takes about two minutes and the table is large, roomy and very sturdy. Realize that one day this table was priced at almost 2x what I paid. For what I paid it is maybe a 5 star. If you paid the higher price it would be 3 stars at best. I know that over time the legs will more than likely get wobbly. They have a large wood screw at the end that connects to the table top. You twist the leg into a predrilled hole. Thats it. They do manage to all end up in the correct position. ", "Wonderful little table. Easy assembly; you just screw in the legs. Solid, but light weight, so probably not good for keeping anything important on. The corners are SUPER SHARP, so you want to get some protectors on those. It's pretty solid black, so you will have trouble seeing this table at night. I just taped some orange bubble wrap packaging to those corners, and I've yet to bump into it over more than a month later. It looks nice for what it is, but it's not high fashion. Get this if you need a table and don't want to spend furniture store prices. Also, and it shouldn't because it's made of some composite resin, doesn't smell bad at all. I'm not sure what they used to paint it, but the paint is odorless and has stayed nice and black for the time I've had it. Amazing value for $11. The assembly is really easy but it also isn't a particularly durrable material or design. It's clearly designed to be as light weight for shipping as possible. No included brackets to add stability, and it will probably tear the legs out the first time a dog or kid runs into it. At $20, this is great. 5 piece assembly and it's literally just screwing in the bottom to the board. Easy. Looked great. However I noticed it jumped in price after I ordered mine. I guess I got lucky. The material is decent, but I'm not sure if it's $37.99 decent (what it's currently priced at). omg, cray easy to put together! I bought this to use as makeshift table for laptop and sewing machine when I want to do quick projects. It's in my tiny bedroom in front of cushy chair normally used for tv watching. I pull the sewing machine out from under the bed and plop it up on the table.  I bought two of these, so I could place them together for medium length table and I have a board nearby that I can place across the two and make a really long table if I need.  It's low, but that's excellent for my needs. I can also use it as a foot rest if I want, put a pillow on top if I want to. The tables for 11 bucks area not bad at all.  But man there very short. I guess I shoulda really paid more attention to the height of them. But compared to our COUCH's or Bed's.. This is REALLY really low.  I basiclly need to stack 2 on top of each other drill into the legs to secure it and then chop off about 3 -4 inches of the bottom set of legs to make it a normal height.. but hey for $22 bucks it's a great end table. Honestly a four year old could assemble these tables without help, and once they put them together they'd have a fairly difficult time destroying them, even if they used them as a ladder to reach something else. They are sturdy and the finish is beautiful, just watch out for the corners, I've already scratched up my knees a couple of times. It is very wobbly. Little bit of pressure makes a creaking sound. It feels hollow inside and not real wood. Feels cheaply made and should be worth 20 bucks.. legs are slanted and I\u2019m not sure how much it will hold. Let me be clear this was a returned and slightly discounted item. I took the risk knowing what my uses would be. Came with a large gash on top surface, but I placed a very large floor A/C unit (speaks to its sturdiness). I had already purchased one of these full price and was very satisfied. I'm way too lazy to return this, and will live with it. Roll of the dice when you buy returns. I needed a simple table for a large copier/printer/scanner that I have, and this fit the need perfectly.  Its lightweight, but surprisingly sturdy.  The construction and finish is very similar to items you'd find at Ikea, but the price was phenomenal...you just can't go wrong with this for $15!  It assembles in a snap (literally, screw four legs by hand into the table top).  I was going to make my own table, but I couldn't find the materials for cheaper. This was a super affordable option for me. All of my furniture is from IKEA, and I have everything Malm series for my bedroom, but I opted out of buying the malm dresser because it was like $70 which I had before and wasn\u2019t too fond of it. And then I realized without those small dressers, my room looked kind of empty. I needed a little side table for my lamp. ", "This end table is no joke.  I just moved and lost almost all of my furniture.  The TV console I ordered was stolen by neighbors immediately [because an inept mail carrier thought it was a good idea to leave it unattended UNDER the the mailbox in a building with no cameras or monitoring staff] and I had to place my 32\" TV on this.  No sweat.  It took it with style.  I'll be ordering 2 more of these soon.  I need to complete my living room and this will be a necessary part of that.  It's beautifully modern.  Just my style. The packaging was up to usual Amazon standards, and as I'd ordered a couple of other things, it was dual boxed, so not a chance of damage. This is a nice basic end table that can be used for just that or a printer table next to a desk. It took me 5 minutes to assemble! there is the base, the legs with screws already in them and no hardware. Just simply turn the legs until they are tight and then done! I bought two of them and am going to buy two more. This color (black) was $13 on Amazon Prime. You will not find a table for a better price. ***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*** My wife put these together in very short order, they are sturdy and can be used for multiple scenarious. Including the lonely nightstand. She had her doubts about these as nightstands but she kept bugging me to get some nightstands for the house. I would get frankly annoyed at the prices for nightstands when I did research, high priced and no functionality. At those prices they should have built-in power sockets, lights, anything but some fancy curved feet. I have two of these tables that I purchased a while back and though they're pretty inexpensive they're cute.  I use one on each side of my entertainment unit in my living room to put our lamps on and they look nice.  These are not high quality tables by any means but if you take care of them and don't knock them around they hold up pretty nicely and look pretty good.  Assembly is easy.  The legs screw into the bottom of the base and voila! Table.  They're fairly lightweight but definitely sturdy enough to have a pretty heavy and large lamp on it as well as some framed photos and ginger jar candles.  I would not suggest allowing a child to, say, climb on it as the corners are sharp and it may not hold up to having the weight of a child on it, but as a basic end table you can't go wrong with this. I needed a black, simple end table to store stuff on. This literally takes less than 5 minutes to put together because all you do is screw in each leg and that is it. The end table is modern-looking and can really go anywhere in the house. I have used it in the living room, master bedroom, second bedroom, and kitchen. It is a very versatile piece that holds at least 40 lbs of weight without issue. I also know that it handles spills well because I have spilled many times on it and the wood still looks brand new without any signs of wear or tear after two years of use. First, I bought this table because it was so cheap.  I needed a square low table for my office at work to put my mini fridge and small microwave on.  This fit the bill.  It's perfect for it.  Did I mention how cheap this was? Haha.  Ok, besides that, it was super easy to put together - pre drilled holes in the tabletop corners and screws already in the legs.  Just twist the legs into the tabletop.  Done.  One issue is that when you put weight on it, be sure to make sure all the table legs are straight.  Being of cheap construction the legs tend not to be totally solid - especially if you need to move it.  Other than that, it's great. My girldfriend's mom is diabetic and has mobility issues and wanted a refrigerator close to her bed where she can keep juice in case she has an attack in the middle of the night.  We got her a mini-fridge, but it was too hard for her to reach it on the floor, so we needed a table to prop it up on.  We originally found this exact table on Walmart's website under their Mainstays brand label, but it was listed as \"in store only\" and none of the stores around us had it.  On a whim, I decided to check Amazon and found the same thing, at a cheaper price, with free Prime shipping.  Win! If you need a simple, short, side table- BUY THIS! I dread assembling furniture. Not because I can't or need help. But because 99% of the time the directions are 10 times harder than they need to be, or the method is overly complicated. I was so relieved when I opened the box to find NO hardware...and one sheet of paper. The screws are already in the legs, put the table top upside down, twist the legs in, BOOOM...you've got a table! It doesn't look or feel like a $14 table. Ten times better than anything on the shelf at your local Wal-Mart. I needed a small table for some audio gear. After looking at a ton of table for $50-100, I found this for $18. It arrived in two days, took 10 minutes to assemble and it looks great, totally sturdy, and a perfect fit for my needs. It would work great in a living room as an end table as well - attractive enough to work well. Great buy! ", "Ordered this to be a side table for an ailing elderly relative. She has very little strength but enjoys still moving her furniture around. So what? Well, this is not only an absolute breeze to assemble (just screw on the four legs and you're finished!) but it weighs a few ounces less than nothing! N, actually it does weigh a little, but we're talking a pound or two and not ten, fifteen or twenty like you might expect. The dimensions are not the same as the \"Lack Table\" and this product doesn't work for building the 3d printing enclose. The whole thing ends up being too small. < That part was to  help my friends in the 3d printing community. This next part it why it gets 1 Star > These tables are very cheap, made from pressed cardboard and completely hollow. The structure of the table is wobbly due to the leg bolts being held in place by a cardboard tube. I purchased two of these tables and both of them sit unevenly, when I measured the legs the very about 1/4\" (6mm). I will personally be tossing them right in the burn barrel this weekend. They don't work as a 3D Printing enclosure, and I wouldn't trust them as a table. This table is low to the ground and easy to assemble. Looks just like the picture and for $10 is a great deal. However, I would not spend more than 10 on this, especially if you are not in college or a first apartment. As simple as it looks, I could not picture this table next to any real furniture; however, it looks perfect next to a futon, mini fridge, folding storage ottomans, and microwave. My roommates and I are using this to hold our Keurig and it is sturdy enough to hold it and our mugs, however it is not large enough to hold much more than that, but we're getting a basket to hold the rest of our dishes and silverware underneath it. I think a small to mid sized microwave would fit nicely on it. Also, when we screwed in the legs it took a while to get them so that they looked straight and so the table wouldn't wobble. Also, you can take it apart and store it over breaks or for moving and since I go to college out of state, the is really convenient. For what we need, it is absolutely perfect! If you are in college or in a first apartment, I would highly recommend this. However, if you aren't as pressed for money and/or want a more \"homey\" looking piece, it might be worth it to splurge on a more expensive one. On the other hand, the other styles we looked at were too high off the ground for our Keurig to reach the outlet, so it's great if it's what you need! Changed my star rating because it was a 5 at 12 dollars but anything over 22 dollars not. The price changes from 11 to 22 to over 30 back and forth. This is a really nice little table for the price. It's a little on the small side, but it works well for me. Seems to be holding ~50lbs pretty well, but I don't know how much more it would hold. It was easy to put together, the legs come with little screw-pegs that you twist onto the tabletop. 10 minutes and it was together. These little tables are great.  I would not pay more for it because the material is cheap, but it holds up well and it's very easy to assemble and it's worth every penny.  I'm a happy camper. I bought two of these at $10 a piece and stacked them to make a rack for my pc, subwoofer for my pc speakers, and HP printer on top. I store my paper shredder underneath it on the floor. Stacked, it comes up to my chest while I'm sitting at my desk which is right next to it. Just an FYI for those interested...I drilled a 1/4\" down in each of the four corners and pushed a wood dowel with a dab of Elmer's wood glue into each hole. While that was drying, I drilled the same 1/4\" hole into the bottom center of each of the legs for the table that was going to sit on top. Once the glue dried I lined up the top table legs with the dowels and pressed down until the top table legs were sitting on top of the table underneath. Now I have what appears to be a two level shelf system but I can still pull them apart if I need to transport them. I am very happy with this table. First of all, the price is great. I was looking for something sturdy and not cheap-looking, but for a decent price. I was a bit afraid that this table would be poor quality at such a low price, but it is a lovely table and looks very modern. I don't have anything extremely heavy on it, just a bonsai and a few bags of dog treats, but it feels quite sturdy. At the same time, it is lightweight and easy to move around.The assembly is ridiculously easy. All you do it screw in the legs, no tools or anything needed, and it's done. I wanted to like this table! It had so many good reviews. The first one arrived damaged both on the top of the table along with one of the legs. I returned it and received a second table with a damaged top also.  I will be returning it and trying something else instead. Very disappointed! I was wanting to use it in my office at work. Well it is a $18 side table, so temper your expectations and don\u2019t expect a very sturdy table. But serves it purpose, doesn\u2019t look cheap and matches modern furniture very well. Definitely meant for small spaces! Can hold a printer, a table lamp and a few 5x7 picture frames without a problem ", "Let's be up front here - you get what you pay for. These tables are exactly what I wanted - something cheap that I won't cry about when my children and/or cats inevitably destroy them. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised. The tables are EASY to put together (open box, screw legs on - no tools). They appear to be pretty solid. I bought them for a \"night stand\" and a side table but ended up putting my microwave on one for the time being and it held that beast up. If I need more tables later, I would look at these again. Very attractive table, was very easy to assemble (no tools needed). It was able to be assembled from unpacking to completion in about 3 minutes. As is possible sometimes with tables, one of the legs seemed just a very tiny bit shorter than the others or it's possible that I didn't push one, or some, of the other legs hard enough into their designated slots (most likely), so it wobbled just a teeny-tiny bit, but this little cutie is just what I needed. It also holds a good amount of weight as I sat upon it and I wriggled around to see if it would stand up under my weight (140 pounds) and it did. It upheld me with no signs of falling apart or collapsing. I am well pleased with this item. The price was right, too. Very affordable. This is actually quite a nice table for the cheap price. I have bought this since I was on a hunt for a 20x20 table to make into a lego table for my son. I was impressed with how sturdy this actually is. It was very easy to put together. easy to screw the legs in and no issues with it not fitting together. Now to wait till Christmas to see how well it holds up to a 3year old and a 6 year old. However I did have a 30 gallon tote full of books sitting on top of it overnight (to make sure the glue set for the lego plates) and it held that up quite well no issues. Will most likely be ordering another so the kids don't fight over it :) This table is dirt cheap but hell it is easier to put it together than IKEA furnitures and yes there is imperfections on the tables. It is a bit wobbly depend on where you place the table for example the uneven corner where I place it but it is easily fixed by flipping the table around. Also the table is really fragile so don't bump against any surface too hard but other than that it does what a table suppose to do to put stuff like a printer on it. This little table works well for small spaces or in kids rooms perhaps.  It looks nice and holds up well.  I've had one for 7 years and it's still going strong.  This was my second one to add in another room.  Even though it's called an \"end table\", you may not like it sitting next to your couch or chair because of the fact that it is rather short.  I tend to like end tables to be even with the arm of the couch and chair or maybe slightly taller, but this table is a few inches shorter.  I have used this as an end table for years until I could replace it and it worked fine, it's just a bit annoying and looks a little weird being so much shorter than other furniture.  However, I am still happy with the table as a cheap storage, work or \"clutter\" desk.  It would also probably be good for holding plants or vases. I ordered two of these tables and they don\u2019t disappoint. They\u2019re a little big for night stands which is what I use them for but I have so much I keep next to me when i sleep so it works for me. Super easy to assemble. You literally just have to screw the legs on. It came in a sleek box and was delivered to Alaska no problem. I think the product seems sturdier than that of a similar item in IKEA. Ordering another table because my son asked for one in his room. Super easy to assemble, no tools needed. Didn\u2019t know I was getting a Mainstays brand table though (Walmart\u2019s brand). Actually came from Walmart in a Walmart box, but I ordered it from amazon prime. No big deal really, just would\u2019ve been nice to know. Strong. Sturdy. Looks good. It\u2019s being used for our water cooler, to give it height. So it\u2019s strong enough for that plus the 5gal water jug. Long ago, I purchased the Parsons Coffee Table.  It's moved with me to several apartments.  I recently moved again, this time to an apartment with more room.  I've always loved my Parsons Coffee Table, so I quickly went online to see if Parsons made end tables and found these. For an inexpensive little end table, I was pleasantly surprised.  So much so, I bought a second one.  It says 50 lbs. is the maximum weight it can handle.  I wouldn't feel comfortable putting that much on there.  I would put the max somewhere between 35 and 40 lbs. I love these tables. They are perfect end tables. They are very easy to assemble. I bought two and they still look great after a few years. I also bought the parsons coffee table. It was a good size, easy to assemble, and is holding up well. ", "This thing is SO easy to put together. After weeks of putting together new furniture for our place, I wanted to hug this table (not recommended as the edges are sort of sharp). All you have to do is pull out the incredibly lightweight pieces, which consist of the tabletop and legs, screw in said table legs and then you're done! Less than two minutes. This is the absolute perfect size for a 2x2 12\u201d plate LEGO table. Lightweight, but not junk, so easy to move when playing in different rooms. But, if you don\u2019t need a LEGO table, it\u2019s still perfect. Very stylish and looks like something you would pay a whole lot more for. Extremely easy and quick to assemble, which is always a huge deal for me. Will probably buy a couple more to have around the house, they look that nice. I just moved into a 495 square foot studio apartment so floor space is at a premium.  A full sized coffee table was definitely not an option but neither was having my guests hold their drinks all day.  So I bought this end table and repurposed it to be my coffee table and its perfect!! I ordered this table to make my son a LEGO table for Christmas. It fits 4 green LEGO baseplates perfectly and is a great height for kids. The price can\u2019t be beat. I would definitely suggest this for others that don\u2019t intend to use it for anything heavy. This was a great table for a cooler that I bought here on Amazon. None You basically just screw in the four legs to the table. It is pretty low so don't get if you need height for your table. It is quite a bit shorter than your typical bed that isn't directly on the ground. Very nice looking and crazy easy peasy to assemble. An awesome value. More than satisfied. Buy yours today. Don't waste time. Order it before time runs out. We only pass through here once so order yours before time comes to the end! This little table does exactly what it should.  It is not made of expensive woods, nor is it heavy at all.  But, I use mine to hold a multi-function printer in my home office, and for that, especially at this price, does extremely well.  I am going to buy a second table for my other printer as well. I needed a small coffee table to fit my room and this little square was perfect. Easy to assemble and sturdy. One small piece of the finish is peeling back at little on the leg but otherwise it is well made. ", "Nice looking table and easy to put together. All you have to do is spin the leg with the screw in it into the holes on the table top. Took about 2 minutes for my kids to put together. As soon as it was put together my son put the cat on the table and she jumped off leaving scratch marks where all 4 of her paws were. It is very light that a toddler could carry it around. From a distance the table looks very nice. But as soon as you touch it, you can tell its cheaply made. It feels like its made of cardboard with a veneer covering the top and legs. Since it was so cheap, I can't complain. You definitely get what you pay for on this. I honestly ordered this thinking I'd just be a simple little table to put one of my printers on, but they look very nice for the price. No issues with assembly or packaging, and they are very light even an older person shouldn't have trouble moving them around or assembling. Black color looks good for sitting next to a TV stand or in the corner of a room with a vase and plant on top. I mean, what do you want for $20? It stands up, you can put things on it, reasonably level. The general cheap-ness means that it's light as a feather, which can be a good thing. For the money, I like it a lot. I have the Parson's Coffee Table, and I wanted matching end tables for my lamps. I have a futon in between these end tables. They are actually a bit larger than I expected, but they still worked fine with my furniture layout. They are exactly square, but are a bit wider/deeper than the coffee table. That is fine with me. I have a few aircraft models that look great with the lamps on this table. I was pleasantly surprised first that we received the tables today...but they are very sturdy and have a Quality look.Simple 10 minute install of 4 legs and again the legs tightened at just the right spot be almost perfectly square with the edges of the table top...We are very pleased and again...appreciate the way we save money at Amazon!Although it is very sturdy I would NOT recommend heavy objects being placed on them! This end table is unbelievable! I was not expecting much due to the very low price, but I was pleasantly surprised!  It arrived packed very well and protected, so no scratches.  Then when I got it out of the box it was SO easy to assemble! No tools required, just screw the legs onto the table top and you're done in 2 minutes!  This thing is sturdy, and the black color is beautiful.  It fits perfectly in my room and I think would be indistinguishable from similar Ikea models.  Great purchase, I'm so happy I took a chance on this because I don't have a car and the delivery was a breeze! Amazing table for the price. Looks good, super easy to put together and does the job perfectly. Only downfall is that it\u2019s not super sturdy or durable but that\u2019s okay since that\u2019s not what I was looking for anyway. Very happy customer. For $20 something, the \"table\" looks nice, but as it is a screw on leg piece, it wobbles. If you sit on it or try to put something heavy, someone would need to hold the table because it will lean and will not stabilize. It holds my printer, which is hardly ever touched. Adds to my living room, but the table itself is no table at all. My 30yr old coffee table is more stable than this stand. Very simple but met needs inexpensively!  I've assembled a lot of furniture and this was by far the easiest assembly yet! Legs just screw right into the table top.  No screw drivers or Allen key needed - my 5 year old assisted perfectly. I just relocated and had to purchase all new furniture. Obviously, this isn't cheap and I was really looking for affordable items that functioned well. I didn't need anything fancy. This end table fit the bill. Putting it together was a breeze, and for the price it's relatively strong and I'm surprised how nice it looks. Sure, it's not marble or glass but it also doesn't look how cheap it was. I plan on ordering a few more. It's not very tall so if you have a tall couch you probably wouldn't like it but it works well with my futon. Great surface size. ", "I just needed basic side tables -for the living room and one for my bedside. For 19 bucks a pop, I couldn't ask for anything better. They are actually quite sturdy, look good, and take all of 2 minutes to assemble. I'm going to order a few more and keep them stored away. For 19 dollars I don't see myself getting all bent out of shape if one breaks in the future. sure. if you 'need' looks, shelves, whatever, this is so not the table for you. But I didn't feel like paying 80-100 dollars for something that I will use just for a remote control or two, a glass and plate occasionally, and my glasses at night. Recieved damaged. It had rained a little the day of delivery and the box was slightly warped like it had gotten wet. When I opened the box the table was peeling and really warped. Legs were splitting. Mustve got wet in transit because it was dropped off in my garage. Just dont spill nothing on them. It is very easy to put together which made this great, and it does the job. It's easy to clean and it holder a pretty good amount, though I don't know if I would sit on it for extended periods of time. Very much worth the cost in my opinion. Just know that it sits lower to the ground and it's not that big, but I think it's great if you're a student and need a small table to eat one, to put laps on, to put feet on... very versatile and worth the cost especially if you're a student. Tables are a great size. I use them as nighstands, and they're bigger than an average nightstand. They were super easy to assemble. No tools required. Just screw in the legs to the tabletop. Awesome! They are a little wobbly, but if you have something with weight on top, then they're okay. Despite this quality, I still gave the review 5 stars because they are so affordable. For the price, you shouldn't expect to get something too heavy. I love them. They serve their purpose and look very chic. I don't believe they look cheap at all! I recommended these to my family and friends. Tou know the saying \"you get what you pay for\" But with this table it looks good and does good for just what I wanted it for. I think I'll spray clear coat paint over it later to make the finishing more durable. We're not rough on our furniture anyway so I know we will have it for a long time. Good buy. Simple and sleek, good for a standard side table.  Big plus is the remarkable ease of assembly.  No tools are required.  Packaging is very simple too...just enough to securely get to you. I mean it's a table for $13 shipped (At least when I purchased it).  I didn't have high expectations for quality or looks.  I just wanted it to do its table thing.  It was super easy to assemble and it indeed functions as a table which is exactly what I wanted and needed for $13.  Could really not ask for anything better, especially with delivery to my door for that price. I agree with other viewers, for the money this is a very attractive black table.  Good for bedside, couch side, etc.  Assembly literally requires screwing the legs on, no tools needed. Got a great price on this little table, and it came quickly!  I was able to cut a few inches off the bottoms of the legs for my intended purpose, and its strength doesn't seem to be reduced at all.  It now has a small mini-fridge sitting on it, and it's doing just fine! Good, simple table. I got two to serve as night stands and I'm pleased! They're bigger than I envisioned which is a nice surprise and took 5 minutes to put both together (literally screw the legs in, that's it). I don't think they're incredibly sturdy but I don't intend to use them for anything super heavy. ", "Solid, sturdy table and extremely easy to assemble. Using it and two faux leather storage ottoman's as seating in a toddler room. This isn't something I would use as furniture as it looks as cheap as it is but it makes a great table for a little Christmas tree.  The table, itself, is covered with the tree skirt so it's all good.  When Christmas is over I will put it in my bedroom, cover it with a scarf, and put my cool mist vaporizer on it.  It's a useful little table for $13.00! This little table is so light-weight I didn't realize the package included it! I expected it to be as heavy as some of the other 'not really wood' pieces I've bought, but this table is different. Assembly is easy, you just have to attach the legs which screw into the table top very smoothly and quickly, no tools required. Once assembled, the table seems very sturdy and looks pretty nice as well. I'm very happy with my purchase! My printer had been sitting on the box it was originally packaged in for over a year and I finally worked up the nerve to buy a table.  This one works great, was a snap to assemble, and feels sturdy.  The packaging was excellent and the legs simply screw on.  Mine is on a carpeted floor, but it seems level to me.  It's better than putting my printer on a cardboard box because now I can put a file bin underneath it and free up that much floor space and toss or hide this unsightly cardboard box, finally. Super cheap, super light, and decently sturdy for the price and weight! Using these stacked on one another for a 3D printer enclosure, and it's working well. Our floor lamp needed to be higher in our room with vaulted ceilings.  Rather replacing a pricey floor lamp, this was the perfect fix!  Dark color shows nice grain.  Great little purchase. I bought this for my son\u2019s college apartment, and he requested 2 more. They are lightweight & easy to assemble with no tools\u2014the legs just pop into place. While not super fancy, they are sturdy enough for an end table by the couch or a bedside table. The price is right, too. very lightweight (not necessarily in a good way), somewhat wobbly, doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. This would be an excellent choice for a table that will be used for display purposes to hold a lamp or some items, not necessarily as a table that will be manipulated frequently. I also knocked off a star because I found that IKEA sells this table for under 10 bucks (Lack Side Table) If I had known that I would have driven to IKEA, if you don't have an IKEA nearby this would be a good option. I took the leap and purchased 2 of these table hoping that with the great price the tables would hold up. I was pleased with the ease of how well I was able to put together and that the material seems stronger then expectect.  I am very happy with this purchase. Table works great.  Using it to hold my computer printer.  It doesn't shake or wobble when the printer is running.  Very sturdy. ", "I'm very impressed by this table. I've had the plastic versions in the past, and was figuring this wouldn't be much better. I was pleasantly surprised though. This table while, still light more or less has a heft to it. The legs have a center mounted screw in each leg so that you twist each leg into the table top ad that's it for assembly. Off hand I think the table can actually support about 100 lbs, but I haven't tested it. I bought mine to support a cube refrigerator, and I have no worries that it will. Cheap table.  Not worth the money. The table I received was a Mainstays brand. I would not pay more than $12.94 for this table.  Which is exactly what I paid for a second one at a big box store.  Research the table, you WILL find it else where and save yourself some cash. This is perfect for my 3D printer it holds up pretty good I did not think at first glance that it would but it did, I did have to fold up an index card to make it perfectly leveled for one of the legs(front right in the photo) b/c of the grooves on my hard wood floor but other than that it\u2019s perfect for my 3D printer. For my small studio I needed a table for my printer and TV.  I didn't want to pay a lot for them and I found these.  I was a little con cern regarding the weight but after reading the reviews several stated it could handle the weight of a small printer.  I am so thrilled my studio is coming together now.  It was quick and easy to put together only took less than 5 minutes per table.  The height is just right for a small TV and printer.  I have  a plant that I am considering buying and this would be just the right size to set it upon in my dining room. This is a very simple table, which is what I was going for.  I needed something to place our very small, fake Christmas tree on and this was affordable and quick.  The legs twist on making it easy to allow my child to help me put it together and then I can take it a part and store it for next year in the very box it arrived in! Really nice product, perfect for budget living. I rent a small apartment, and was looking for used furniture on Craislist and other online sites. I came across these tables, and they had great reviews. I gave them a try, as they were cheaper than not-as-nice used items, and everything is as advertised. They are super lightweight, and may not support heavy items, but that's not their purpose. This was perfect for what I needed it for. It was very easy to put together and sturdy. I just needed something to go under my table/desk to put my die cut machine on. Perfect! I bought two of these for a closed in balcony. Neither of them are level. I had to put something under one leg of each table to make them stop wobbling. It only takes five minutes to put the legs on literally, but the underside of the table is a light tan. I painted the undersides black which solved the issue. I shouldn't have had to do that though. These are slightly cheap tables, but they do the trick. The price is right for sure. I bought this table since I needed to put my portable AC on top of it so it can reach the window (I live in a basement apartment). Table is big enough and sturdy enough to hold a 12,000 btu portable as on top! I will be using it as a coffee table when the AC is no longer in use. Definitely got my money worth Shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. It is was packed well on the inside of the box. Hopefully, they have improved that so others aren't receiving the item damaged. It's made of that hollow board material. Almost like re-enforced balsa wood. The assembly sheet states that it will support 50lbs max. Personally, I wouldn't push that limit. It's just not designed to hold heavy items over 50lbs. It's great for a modern printer or small bookshelf stereo or smaller TV. You might be able to get away with a 42\" TV but, I wouldn't recommend doing that since it's designed as a table and not an entertainment center. ", "Although it is light weight and it says maximum weight limit 50 pounds .....I have my 85 pound  Portable Air Conditioner sitting on it very steadily and strong . I bought this table to lift my indoor Portable Air conditioner high so that I can drain condensed water directly into 13 gallon bucket not having to worry for a week emptying the bucket. Now I m enjoying my GOOD SLEEP for a week or more . Perfect for what I needed. Cheaply made and I wouldn't trust too much weight on it but it looks nice and was extremely inexpensive. What I assumed, was that it was not Rock solid, based on the price. I must say, it was decent...and happy with the quality considering. Exactly as expected. Cheap price but sturdy product, easy to assemble. Only advice is if you\u2019re gonna but drinks on it use coasters, moisture will destroy the partial board/ wood. Bought this table to go with our two new Boss Office Products Guest Chairs that we purchased from Amazon. The table was inexpensive and just what the office needed to complete the look. Would buy product again. Wonderful purchase. I had some hesitation about getting this since it was so inexpensive. I imagined some cheap, flimsy POS end table that would break if you set a drink on it. However, based on previous reviews (and the fact it was so inexpensive), figured \"why not?\" For the price you can't ask for anything more. No tools needed to assemble, light, and sturdy enough to hold a lamp, drinks, food, or anything else found at an end table in your living room. It will probably hold you up if you were to briefly sit or stand on it, but I wouldn't use it as scaffolding or a chair. Finish is nice and packaging protected it during transit. If you're on a budget for furniture, this is the way to go. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because I received it damaged. Not huge but the crack is there. Other than that I was happy with purchase. With the table came instructions on how to replace parts if they came damaged. Unfortunately, when I type the IM # it asks for it says it is wrong. I triple checked to see if I am typing correctly and all looks good. Not sure why it is not allowing me to do so. These were surprisingly nice for the cost (ten at the time). I was expecting total crap but they look actually kind of classy. Absolutely do not pay more than ten for them because you can get them from Ikea or Walmart for ten. Very easy to put together. Nice texture to them, decent looking simulated wood grain. Good for college dorms or your first apartment. I purchased this table to put a small refrigerator on top of in my office. The refrigerator fits perfectly on top of this table, and both the refrigerator and table are black, so it looks really nice. Very simple to assemble and very sturdy. ", "We ordered two of these as end tables in the bedroom and, while simple, they are quite sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. So far, no scratches of any sort and it easily holds my 20+ lb cat who insists on using it to get on the bed. We've also put some storage bins underneath to hold things like cables and whatnot and the table is of a height/width that it can easily house some larger woven baskets if we had wanted to do that. Overall, great side/end table for a great price - highly recommended. 1- Item arrived scratched on top.  Dry noticeable not sure how it passed QA. This is a great little table, for the price. It's similar to ones that were popular \"back in the day,\" but the legs screw in, making them more secure than the older push-in (fall-out) style. The finish is fine for my purpose, and the size is generous. My daughter out this together in about 2 minutes. Great for her apartment! Sturdy, paint looks nice and just the right size next to my platform bed. For the money, you literally can't go wrong. The box came with screws already on the 4 legs.  Took 4 minutes to assemble and it holds my printer at the perfect height!  Great value!!! Right size and sturdy. Put my Dyson room heater on it to keep the cat from sticking his tail into it when walking through. Basic, modern table that I highly recommend. It's really just 5 pieces of wood, you screw in the legs, and that's it. But despite the 50 lbs max weight on the page, trust me, these things can hold a lot more than that! A cheap, good looking black side table that adds utility and some style. The deliver was quick and efficient. The assembly is super easy! You just screw the legs into the holes on the square board and you're done. Less than five minutes. No tools necessary. Only negative is that its a bit wobbly but I'm sure if its because of the uneven tile flooring in my room or due to uneven legs. Regardless, it's still a good purchase for the price. ", "I have purchased several of these and use them as printer stands in my store and office. They don't provide a shelf for paper storage, and don't feel particularly solid, but sturdy enough to hold my printers and they look nice as well. Assembly is super easy, just screw in the legs. There are no adjustable feet, but seems fairly square on flat floor. Cheap, easy to put together! I hate putting products together. Just twist in 4 legs and you're done. I have two of these. 1 holds my printer connected to my computer. The other holds some other misc parts like alarm clock and humidifier. No issues at all! I have now bought 2 of these, they are sturdy and easy to assemble, no tools required and they seem to hold up pretty good. I have it 4 stars because it is obvious is made of cheap materials. It is still a good product, though. It is particle board, but it is really nice and sturdy. It was so easy to put together and looks real good in the bedroom. I like it, package excellent, didn't need any tools. The price is also good. Bought 2. It stands up with no problems, place a lamp, clock. Looks good by the bed. Happy Good end table, sturdy and very easy to put together. Table is very light. Looks great. Great little table very sturdy and easy to put together. Highly recommended table for small rooms. This took 5 minutes to assemble and is sturdy. It has a nice finish. What more could I ask for?! Bought a few to construct a 3D printer enclosure.  Hollow corrugated card core makes for a very lightweight enclusure, and easy to attach things to via screws and whatnot.  Otherwise very stable.  Fits a Prusa i3mk2, if you\u2019re shopping for the same reasons. These tables are GREAT quality for the price. I ended up getting a second one and have them along side my bed until I get the bedroom set I desire. Cute little end tables. Super easy to put together, you just screw in the legs and youre done.

Not too small, Not too short, Not cheap looking, IT IS PERFECT! Easy assembly. Looks nice. Perfect for printer. I keep a material bin underneath with paper inside. I ordered a second one for my file folder holders and other office desk accessories because I have a small office desk in my house with two computers on it. I happened to want an end table with these exact dimensions to set an object on, and this fit the bill exactly. Nice wooden parson's table.  I use it to hold a drink, fan, or stuff that doesn't fit onto the stamd/table for the laptop or notebook PC,  Handy and inexpensive solution for that extra but necessary stuff. I purchased this exclusively to put desktop workstations on it while i imaged them.  I figured i could put two on top and two on the bottom so I wouldnt have to go to the work bench and sit there all day.  This way i can stay at my workstation and image computers and not skip a beat.  I'm more productive because I dont have to keep going back and forth to check on the workstations.  Once the disc is done i can see it open up and slip in disc two and keep on working. This was the most easy to assemble piece of furniture I have ever bought. The legs come with the screws in them, so all you have to do is attach them to the top. It fits perfect next to my bed, creating a minimalist look.

It was easily assembled from what I heard and that's good. This was great table, it was strong and perfect to place my mini fridge on top. Lightweight and versatile.  Good for the money. Unbelievable quality for this ridiculously low price. Easy to put together- just screw in the four legs. Table is well made. I bought this affordable table to make a lego table with and it is fantastic.  The size is perfect too.  It's a 20x20 table and the lego plates come in 10x10 so using 4 plates they match up perfectly.  I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  Highly recommend! You get what you pay for. I have similar tables from Ikea that cost $7 they are more sturdy than this product. The legs keep turning. It does serve its purpose but I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting anything over 10lbs on it.

Worked perfect for what I needed it for.  Assembly couldn\u2019t be easier, there are 4 legs with the screws already in them, and then just screw the 4 legs to the base of the table. Great style. Fantastic quality Sturdy, light weight, excellent value. Best of all, inexpensive. I have a four year old who is on mission to destroy furniture. So I didn't want to spend to much for end or coffee tables.

I would recommend these tables to anyone looking for a cost effective way to furnish their home. Looks great! So easy to assemble!! It has potential, but not wood. Black grain Looks nice, lightweight, but one side was completely crushed in. Screw on the legs, so easy to assemble.  Great starter furniture if it doesn\u2019t come damaged. Great cheap table! It has sharp edges/corners so be aware of that, but I've used it both as a night stand and a tv stand and it has held up well for a year or so on a very tight budget. This is perfect!  I've bought plastic tables that cost more than this--and this table looks soooo good!  Nice woodgrain, sturdy, sleek--you would never think it was so inexpensive.  Plus it took about 2 minutes to assemble! Update* I gave this table away to a friend and regret it. It went up 10 dollars and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth 18 dollars.... but when it was only 8 dollars  here\u2019s my review :::: Perfect for your college home away from home. Sleek looking and still affordable. It feels cheap but looks amazing. I would most definitely purchase again. Bought this table to use alongside my desk to place my printer on top of. It's not a huge table so any decent size printer will take up the majority of the top and I like that it sits lower than the desk. It's incredibly easy to put together - you just screw the legs in to the base/top. I wouldn't stand on it or use it for anything I wanted to show case but as an $11 printer stand you can't beat it. The wood is not very dense and the black wood coating is just a veneer. This veneer makes it easy to clean but it's also easy to scratch, dent, and peel off. As long as you aren't looking for a top quality piece that you will get years out of, it will do the trick! ", "Its nice The order arrived on time and as described. It was extremely easy to setup and it looks great! I might have to buy another one...  I would purchase from this seller again. The table is pretty lightweight, and when you put it together, you can feel that it's generally cheap material. But for the price, this is a steal. I wouldn't put a lot of weight on it (e.g. stand on it), but it looks nice, and it does it's job as a nice end table. I actually use it as a coffee table in my dorm room. Perfect solution for a poor college student! Assembly couldn't be easier. It took me about three minutes to put together. I bought this to put a bar refrigerator on to raise the height.  It is insanely easy to assemble, just screw the legs on, I got it at a great price, and it is very sturdy. Best part about this product is that there are seriously instructions included to put it together. There are four legs the same size that screw in. Lol! This table was shorter than I expected even but that's my fault since I am bad at measurements. It's cheap but sturdy. It's what my mother-in-law wanted and she is pleased.  I'd call that an absolute success and I am very pleased with myself.  All in all, not a bad table for the money. I have an Ikea table, this one is looks like same It is a very inexpensive table that requires some assembly (table legs) that is simple. It's simple and cheap. It's exactly what I expected. It's hollow. It looks like wood. It's extremely easy to put together. You just screw in the legs. I put a dab of gorilla glue when I put on the legs just to make sure they don't move and stay in there for the life of the table. I definitely wouldn't let your children stand on this sucker. Honestly was surprised that it was made so well - bang for my buck ", "Exactly as described. Lightweight but sturdy. Not fine furniture but good quality given the price. Not real wood but have had no problems with stains, scratches, or any other damage. My kids use these as craft tables and if these can stand up to my 3 kids under 5 then it was well worth the money. Easy to assemble just screw on legs and voila. Even if this cost a little more, I'd still give it five stars.  Has real wood veneer.  It is extremely light.  Not the kind of end table you'd want your kids standing on and jumping up and down on though.  That being said, it was extremely easy to put together and is sturdy enough for its intended use. Bought one and then a second. Too easy to assemble, you just screw the four legs on tight. No tools or drilling necessary. Solid little table. Installation was easy. Don't know why Amazon offered the $86 installation option. For particle wood, it feels pretty solid. It works for what I need it for. Best deal I got all year on Amazon.

I don\u2019t put anything heavy on it and it\u2019s hold up very well. Legs are even and there is no wobble and the put together is very simple. I also used VViViD XPO White Grey Marble Gloss Vinyl Film Contact Paper to cover the top to add extra glam to an ordinary table. I bought this as a lego table for my daughter, it fits four 10x10 lego bade square perfectly!!  Super easy to assemble, just twist in the legos and you are done! No tools needed!! Just some strong glue to attach the lego bases. I attached a picture of the \u201clego\u201d bases I bought, they work and are a little cheaper than buying lego brand. These are beautiful. 5 minute assembly time for two tables! Just screw the legs in. My 2 & 4 year old sat on one and no problems. For $17 it is amazing and I may just order more for the bedroom! I like these tables, but please...PLEASE be sure to pay close attention to the measurements and NOT the picture.  These tables are much lower to the ground than they seem in the picture.  I stacked two one on top of the other to achieve something close to the desired height.  This in no way indicates that there is anything wrong with them, they are actually quite sturdy.  I just wish they were a little taller.  My fault for not paying attention to the measurements. This table is incredibly sturdy. While rated at 50lbs max weight capacity, I feel comfortable enough to put more on it. I weigh over 200lbs and tested it by sitting on it. While i wouldn't sit on it for more than a couple minutes and definitely not regularly (don't want to test my luck), the fact that there was no wobbling (I even wiggled a bit) and no bowing demonstrated it's sturdiness. Right now, I use this table as a stand for my giantex portable washer which weighs an est 30lbs to 100lbs depending on how much water in in the washer. On top of the weight is the added pressure of the washer shaking while running and the table is still standing without any damage at all. I will definitely eventually buy more for other purposes. I wasn't expecting much when purchasing this end table. I bought it for it's clean lines, and it's simplistic nature. Also, it's price! It does a good job of looking sleek. This item takes 2 minutes to put together. It's sturdy particle board, but I don't trust it to hold much more than a lamp. I currently have it in my guest bedroom. I like it, and would buy it again, however- I don't see it withstanding the test of time. It's definitely a temporary piece. There was a large, thick raised streak running across the finish on the top of this table... had to pack everything up and take it to a shipping outlet to return it, what a waste of time. There's clearly no meaningful quality control being done by the manufacturer. (This item was described as \"used -- like new\" by Amazon and there was no mention of this glaring defect, or of dents and peeled/chipped laminate on most of the corners of the table -- their quality control is apparently as bad as the manufacturer's and their condition description was an outright lie!) I didn\u2019t have much to spend on an end table and Needed one for a guest room. For 15 bucks I\u2019m extremely happy !! You can\u2019t expect too much out of a table for that price, but this honestly exceeded my expectations. There were two tiny chip offs of the white on the legs but I put that side of the table against the wall so you couldn\u2019t see it. Is the material kinda cheap? Yes. However it holds up great and is very sturdy and even... and for the price I\u2019m happy. This table was a breeze to assemble and has a simple look that could pair well with many types of decor. It feels reasonably sturdy and looks cute in my apartment. The only downside is that it arrived with some minor blemishes although they honestly look worse in the up close photo I took than in real life (see photo). It's the best table in this style that I could find for the price, and I would buy it again. At less than I'd pay for an Ikea side table of almost identical dimensions [at the time I ordered it, anyway - prices fluctuate], it couldn't be better (in every sense :P ).  It's a simple, functional side table that's very easy to put together and doesn't wobble or seem flimsy enough to buckle under a stack of books and a lamp. It's in no way offensive to look at, but I wouldn't try making it fit in with some fancy suite of high-end bedroom furnishings or the like.  And I definitely advise against standing on it, for what I hope are obvious reasons. :D ", "This table is pretty much cardboard.  It is good for temporary use.  Do not put anything wet over it and treat it as you would treat a very fragile ceramic piece, because it can break.  I bought as a temporary solution because of the price, but you get what you pay for.  Fast shipping though.  Amazon Prime is the best of everything. I needed a cheap, pretty end table to go with my white and navy living room.  I ordered this and was NOT disappointed!  I assembled it myself in under 10 minutes, no tools needed just like it said.  It's the perfect size and fits in nicely with my decor.  As a recent college grad, I was very happy with the price, design, and functionality of the product.  10/10 would recommend. The is the easiest table I have ever purchased, just screw in the pre nailed legs and you're done in minutes. I purchased this table and 10x10 baseplates (qty4) to create a lego table for my son. I used Super glu to glue the plates. The plates slightly hang over the edge but it's okay. I'm very happy with my purchase and I saved a ton of money. I got this as a cheap nightstand but it's actually bigger wide than it looks. Definitely sized for like a sofa side table for $20 I'm probably gonna buy another one and have the pair for my living room. To out together you literally just out the tabletop down and twist the legs in. It's obviously not gonna hold hundreds of pounds but for a cheap side table for remotes a lamp and magazines it's awesome I needed something cheap/no-frills for a bedside table in a pinch and this was just the ticket. It's not anything luxurious, but it gets the job done. No tools needed to assemble because the legs just screw right into place by hand. Wouldn't recommend setting an insanely heavy object on it, but it's doing just fine with a couple books, picture frame, and lamp on it right now. If you are reading this, yes, this is a good side table with the lowest price as possible ($20). It\u2019s great quality for the price and was easy to assemble. The only downside is that I put my salt lamp on it and creates moisture and puddles of water. I let the water sit for a little too long and the paint/coating on edges started to peel back. I would advise you to wipe off any spilled liquids immediately to avoid this problem. Overall I\u2019m happy for the price. Love this table! Was very easy to put together. Takes maybe 2 minutes. I painted it to match my daughters room. Painted right over the existing surface with ease and no chipping or peeling. Sturdy little table that now holds an old tv. Arrived fast and meets expectations. I was considering this vs the \u201cLack\u201d table on ikea. IKEAs table was 9.99 this a bit more; but since were in a quarantine Ikea is closed and I needed 2 tables to hold up 2 30 gallon snake tanks. Building it was as easy as screwing on the 4 legs \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Lol nothing else. The only issue I had is these are not glossy as the picture would have you believe they look VERY cheap if something doesn\u2019t fill the area well you get what you paid for, but in this case paying less at ikea would have been better. Got the job done though. Great little table for a night stand for my daughters room. Simple and modern for her room. Don\u2019t expect grade A quality for this price point. Overall, I\u2019m happy with the purchase and would buy again for a kids room.  Idea like quality, so take that as you may.

There is a sticker saying may contain formaldehyde from off gassing , but upon reseach i found that Ikea Furniture has formaldehyde too. Anyway, I cleaned it really well and left it out on the balcony for a couple of days. Be sure to twist the legs on straight and centred or else you'll have a wonky table. Great little end tables. I bought two and they are very durable and easy to put together. I currently do t have anything particularly heavy on them except a table lamp with a glass base, it holds up well and I feel like these will last me a while Sturdy and nice enough. Probably wouldn\u2019t buy if I wasn\u2019t a broke student needing to furnish my living room. Looks like an Ikea side table I saw online but cheaper and probably easier to assemble. Literally all you have to do is stick the legs into the flat part. Overall the table is cute. I\u2019ve seen a few cheaper ones that maybe aren\u2019t as easy to assemble. I do wish this table had fuzzy pads for the bottom of the legs, but there is nothing there. It\u2019s definitely not bad for the price or the speed of shipping. Looks better in person and far more sturdy than I expected. I like them so much I plan on purchasing other parsons tables in the collection -- coffee table, writing desk, console. Even if I weren't on a tight budget, I'd still purchase these. Very easy to assemble and is very study for the price point. Assembly was just screwing in the legs onto the table portion and the legs come preassembled with the screws already in them. Using this for an end table in our living room. Needed inexpensive, extra tables for my beach house that could be moved around easily and bought two. Very glad I did. They are coffee tables together or separate, or fine as end tables too. Just what I wanted. Very lightweight but sturdy enough so they don\u2019t tip.  Bright white color, matte finish. Needed a quick solution for a small space to display some family photos.  Worked out perfectly for what I needed and looks great.  It took less than 5 minutes to put together. I\u2019m RIDICULOUSLY surprised at this price of this coffee table for the quality. I actually bought it for my daughter to color on, as she has two little white and brown chairs that were gifted to us. They are the perfect height for this table. I honestly think I\u2019ll be buying more for my house. The legs screw in tightly into pre-drilled holes.  Took about 2 minutes to put together.  Very sturdy.  I've put a cat cube on top of it to keep the cats from peeing on it if it was on the floor.  Love little parsons tables and this one was just the right size.

I am going to add some wood glue to the legs as they screw directly into table without any plastic screw anchors or anything... the table looks great and does the job. Needed a study but simple plain table. This has a  good surface area and looks really nice. Took less than 2 minutes to attached the legs. I like it a lot and thinks it's a good value. Considering buying another one. The table was easy to install and features decent quality materials. I use it as a stand for my mini fridge, and so far it has been great. The white does scrap easily, which is okay, but other than that the table is perfect. It was really easy to put together, is sturdy and looks good, we have our chameleon cage on it and it looks great. I don\u2019t like the texture of it (which is weird, I know) but like I said we have a cage on it so it doesn\u2019t really bother me. These end tables are a great deal for the price, but they're a little too short for a standard living room set.  But definitely good for the price. Had no time to drive to Ikea so l bought this instead. Super cheap materials and smaller than Ikea's now l regret it. I use it for my daycare so appearance isn't that important but l know it won't last. One of the legs that are self screwing went through all the way to the top. I would never buy this as a piece of furniture more for kids desk. Anyone who complaims about this table is nuts! I wasn't expecting much for the price and some of the bad reviews, but I didn't need anything crazy; just wanted our fan off the floor. I couldn't be more pleased with it. Might buy another for my 3yrold as an arts, crafts, and play table. It's really a perfect size for kids. Just as pictured Nice little table. I'm satisfied. I bought as a replacement for a broken IKEA LACK side table. Local IKEA is closed during C-19 and IKEA shipping time is unreasonable. If you are considering the same: Table looks like LACK but a bit smaller and does not have the thick IKEA type veneer. Regardless - I'm happy with purchase :) Bought 4.  Easy to put together. Larger surface area. They have a textured, sort of rough finish that I like and would probably spray paint real nicely if you desired. I like them for the money. ", "I wanted a replacement to an ikea table that I got and it\u2019s almost identicle. It\u2019s a little shorter than I wanted but for the price it\u2019s unbeatable. Quality and setup are good and I\u2019d buy one again if I need another. ANYONE can put this together. It is absurdly light for being so stable and strong. Perfect for what we needed. Took less than 5 minutes to assemble. Great buy! Just put this table together today and it was super easy took about 2 minutes.. all you do is twist the legs into the base ( the screw is all  ready attached) holds up to 50lbs.. I am using it as an end table in the living room.. it is a little short but my couch is low so it fits perfect I would recommend measuring the demonstration to know exactly how tall it will look it the space you are planning to use it. I have bought two of these end tables to use as night stands. SO EASY to assemble, you simply screw in the legs to the table with nails already built it. They are very light but not the best material (obviously) and stain very easily! But for the price, can't complain! Bought these as an interim pair of bedside tables since the ones I really want are $600 each with carerra marble.... which I can't stretch to right now. Anyway, 5 min assembly job just slotting legs into place and voila - you have sturdy tables. They are not smooth like the ikea kind, they area little rough to the touch but thats just fine, it doesn't affect the appearance. I dressed them up with picture frames etc and they look good. This was a great little nightstand for an alarm clock and light for our guest room.  And the price couldn't be beat.  It was well packaged and when it arrived my husband kept saying, \"Well, I guess I'll need to put this together.\"  To the husband's surprise, I had it done in about 7 or 8 minutes. Look, its a $20 table.  Don't expect it to be the perfect addition to your beautiful living room, but if you need a quick and cheap side table it looks clean and does the trick.  I would suppose that it would not support a whole lot of weight.  Also it is pretty tiny. It\u2019s not super sturdy- I wouldn\u2019t put anything heavy on it but it is perfect as a side table. I bought it for a vacation Rental. It should hold up okay. Extremely easy to assemble and really cute. The price is awesome for this table. The easiest assembly; just screw the legs on. It\u2019s sturdy enough for me, I\u2019m needing a bedside table so nothing ridiculously heavy is going on top. It\u2019s perfect. No damages on mine. Bigger than expected too. Only complaint is it\u2019s a little low, I wish it was taller. However I knew that before I bought it, so I\u2019m still giving it 5 stars. Table came damaged but it was part of my son\u2019s Christmas present (we turned it into a lego table) so we didn\u2019t have time to return it. Had two large gashes in the side when it arrived.

My cat who is a little thing takes her head and moves it spilling water. The only way I can get her to stop is to take the bowl away from her. I needed a table close to her bowl, Larger than expected simple to assemble, love it This is a great end table. It is perfect for what I bought it for (to place a long standing fan on top of). It is easy to assemble, just screw the legs into the base and PRESTO you got a new end table. It isn't too high and it's super light. I don't think this end table should be used in a busy room, it's more for basic needs or decoration. Love these little tables. Got 2 to use as nightstands in our guest room.They're not top notch quality, but that's obvious when looking at the price. But they are cute and do the job. Would also be cute in a dorm room. Do not buy. Spend you're money on something that's not IKEA. Because once you take it apart, it will never go back together like first day. Awfull.

They hold a lot and look good too. One minor negative is the edges sometimes come scratched a bit, but for the price I'm not bothered. Have one as  nightstand and two as a combined coffee table. All for $45! Table worked perfectly to create a Lego table for my granddaughter. Perfect 20\" square table where 4 lego baseplates fit perfectly on top.  The legs of the table screw in where it is sturdy and takes up little space if that is an issue in the room. Works wonderfully for my DIY lego table  for my son. It was easy to put together you just screw legs on. And holds up just fine when played at. I got the white table, It is easy to paint and make as creative as you want. Perfect as a nightstand for my daughter's room. 5 pieces, less than a minute to assemble. Would buy again. Not the highest quality, but good quality for the price.

Lightweight, doesn't have to be sturdy... perfect. These look okay, but I am not sure how long they will hold up.

Can't beat it for the price! Really convenient table, the quality isn't that of a 1000 dollars table but it isn't noticeable that the quality is bad if it's just sitting there.

Thank you I purchased this knowing full well that it was going to be super inexpensive and that the quality wouldn\u2019t be world class for sure. What I received was a table made out of paper. The plastic coating is not smooth but rough. The coating does not meet at any seam and is peeling off the paper core. The legs are not flush with the table top and are about 1/4\u201d in. Parsons tables have clean flush legs to the top. These not. Thw table weighs nothing and feels as cheap as it looks. very  good! super Satisfied with those 2 little end table It's not nearly as nice or well made as the IKEA version, but IKEA half the price and nicer quality Was borken. One of the legs was broke. I was re-doing my room and had a low budget. this looked affordable and decided to try it out cause it had good reviews. I do not like this at all! I got the matte finish and it stains really easily. The quality is definitely what you pay for, the legs screw in and they don't stay screwed in, get lose in no time. Gets water stains very easily and being white it shows every little piece of dust. The material is starting to peel off after having it for not even 6 months. Would not recommend!!!! Mine came slightly damaged. The laminated was peeled off on one corner. Flimsy. However, it was only $19 Exactly like the photos! I also love that it comes assembled! All you have to do is twist the legs into the top! So easy! No need for a screwdriver! Would be perfect for living room furniture but a little short when it comes to the bedroom as pictured. Overall, I\u2019m impressed! So easy to put together!!! The screws are built in the legs so you just screw the legs into the holes in the top. The quality is great for the price. I bought two to put in my nursery so they won't be holding heavy things, but they're very cute and perfect for what I needed. ", "It's a cheap white end table. I don't know what other people were expecting, but in my case, for the incredibly low price, I got exactly what I was looking for.

Affordable and easy to assemble, just keep on mind what you are paying for, it may last for long or it may not. Perfect for a short-term fix. IT's smaller than the ikea table, it's definitely whiter, but it feels sharp on the edges, wouldn't recomend for a kids room. Super cute and easy to put together. Looks great in the guest room! Great little table for the price. Easy assembly. I have a mini fridge sitting on it, it's plenty strong, assembly was fast & simple. Good sturdy little table.

We really need more companies like this. If  you look through my photos you'll see that these guys went above and beyond to make a truly enjoyable customer experience. First off all of their styrofoam is wrapped in plastic. It's such a little thing, but it makes it so that when you unbox the table, no little white pieces of foam fly everywhere. How cool is that? My husband and toddler were able to put it together in half an hour, you need to screw 8 nails only using the tools provided, and they give you spare nails just in case. The coler is as pictured, its a shade darker than our chairs but you cann't tell from far. It is sturdy solid wood not MDF which is common in that price range. I added felt pieces so it doesn't scratch our floor. And it arrived a week before the promised date (yay) Great table but I hate that they packaged it with so much styrofoam and plastic. These materials will never biodegrade and will pollute our earth for centuries to come. @Zinus, please consider switching to frustration-free fully recyclable packaging! I hesitated to buy this since it had no reviews. I was afraid it would be super heavy and made of particleboard with a faux wood finish, at this price point. But I took the chance and I am very satisfied. IT IS REAL WOOD. Perhaps not the highest quality wood, but nicely finished and very attractive.  I was able to put it together very easily with the included tool, and I do not have very strong hands. Everything lines up well and goes together snugly. Pros: Very disappointed.  Shipment was two days delayed and when it finally came, the table had significant damage \u2014 wood chip on corner of table, visible from side, top and bottom, two legs have mysterious white paint stains and the table is really, really cheaply made.  Asking for money back and will post an update. This is a beautiful, sturdy little solid wood table, truly excellent for the cost. It looks lovely and the hardware and construction are excellent. My only criticism is that the finish and surface is a bit delicate. But for this price, you would be challenged to find harder wood or better coating. And it's way better than some MDF piece of junk. I clean this once in a while with Endust or wood polish and it gleams. Really nice looking table. Great table at an amazing price. You can hardly find a full wood table at this price. The table is not huge but was perfect for our small space. Would probably work well for many as their second dining table in a smaller dining nook or in the kitchen. This table arrived to my apartment just about a half hour ago. Assembled in less than 10 minutes. Fits nicely in the smallish dining space of my apartment and is a good sturdy little REAL WOOD table. No damage to the table although the box was a bit banged up. I am happy and even when I eventually move and get a bigger table, I\u2019ll keep this little gal around! And obviously the cats approve. This real wood table is beautiful and really fits in with my mid-century modern decor.  The table was very simple to assemble; just screw in the legs.  As much as I love the table I was astounded by the manner it was shipped.  I have never had a delivery so well packed.  The table top was suspended inside styrofoam packing.  If there had been any damage to the box during shipping, it would not have affected the table top because if the superb packing.  In addition, I never had to bother with styrofoam sticking to me and everything around me because EACH PIECE OF STYROFOAM was snugly encased within a plastic sleeve.  Made disposing of the styrofoam a breeze.  But Zinus still wasn\u2019t finished.  Enclosed in the packaging was a free gift of a very nice ratchet tool to help with assembly of future items.  Finally, they enclosed a few blank stationary notes for my use.  In addition to receiving a beatiful and well constructed table in beautiful condition, this was absolutely the classiest delivery I have ever received!  For any future furniture purchases I will definitely be searching for Zinus products first! ", "The table came packaged so nicely. It does have styrofoam inserts, but they are wrapped in plastic so there's no styrofoam mess!! SUPER simple to put together. Maybe took 20 minutes to assemble it alone. Just 2 screws per leg and comes with 2 spare, which I thought was nice. The table is nice and sturdy, feels like great quality, looks great. I have my 4 dining chairs set up one on each of the four sides, but they also fit fine 2 per each of the longer sides. I would absolutely recommend this table. great for small spaces, but isn't too small (4 people can easily use it). Overall, the table looks and feels like a paid a lot more for it. Solid wood, NOT particle board. So, I ordered Zinus Mid-Century Modern Wood Dining Table/Natural from Amazon Prime on March 25th, 2019. It was delivered on March 27th, 2019. That following Sunday on March 31st, 2019 my husband put the table together. I am in love with this table. Its light weight, sturdy, easy to clean.  Earlier today I was cleaning the table and I noticed a decent size crack that ran though the table from top to bottom. Also, the wood is lifting on some parts. This is very upsetting. Some of the photos are taken with flash, others without. I really loved this table. Gorgeous design. It's really unfortunate that it was made so cheaply and not finished properly. Contacting a customer service has been a big pain. To go through refunding or replacing this item I have to first return this item and only then will they start my refund or replace process. Which I can understand, but this leaves me without a table for two weeks, give or take. So, it's not even worth it. And this was a complete waste of money because it will not be long before I'm having to replace the table anyway. It\u2019s a small, light table. Just what I was looking for! We just moved into a smaller place and needed a breakfast nook set. It\u2019s a lovely piece. Wow, I'm really at a loss for words with how impressed I am with this table. Solid wood; espresso is dark however not as dark as coffee. Beautiful color, nice looking grain, super easy to assemble. If you look closely you can see variances and a small dent or two in the table top. Had I paid $500 for the table that would be a dealbreaker. At just over $100 I think I can manage my expectations! No one will ever notice them anyway. Wow. Zinus has made a new dedicated customer. Not only is my product awesome and easy to put together, but they included this cool hex ratchet and a bundle of note cards! Something so small really makes an impact. I'm grateful for both extra items to help me put the rest of my other furniture together and leave a thank you note for the new mailman. Did I mention the product is great? I'm using the table as a desk and it's perfect. Solid wood, well made and the perfect size for a home office. Thank you Zinus, I wish I had known you guys were so awesome before I ordered all this other stuff! Sometime at cough *Ashley cough needs to take some notes, because the table I got from them was all kinds of messed up and I didn't even notice until I put it together. I bought this table because it matched my dining chairs and I needed something small for my apartment. It seemed like a pretty good deal - nothing fancy, but made of real wood instead of particleboard. Wow, I really wish looking back that I'd bought a table from Target or something. I am very satisfied with the table.  The markings on the table are natural for the wood as you could see through the light color.  there are no flaws in it like some of the other reviews.  there is no damage to the corners at all and it is very hard wood.  you can't dent the wood or make any marks on it with your fingernails it is impossible.  There is no such thing as soft wood as I never heard of it made for tables.  You can put something on it that is heavy as I did and it doesn't dent the table.  It comes packaged very well.  The other people are mistaken about the negative reviews as to what they said about the table.  the table is perfect.  I am very glad that I bought the beautiful table.  It was very easy to put together, my son put it together with no problems. Both orders were damaged/defective. First order was damaged, not sure if it was during delivery, and the second order has a crack that looks like it was touched up. It\u2019s a pain to try to drop it off at ups as it would not fit in my car and having to ask people to help haul and borrow a big car. Ups will only pick up during weekdays and business hours which I\u2019m always at work. I give up on this table. I sincerely love my dining table because it was so easy to assemble and also the deep chocolate wooden color looks perfect in my home. I was kind of surprised how small it was but it is so perfect for places that don\u2019t have a lot of room. If I could I would probably get a round table instead of the regular size but in the end I love my table I eat on my table and I work on my table so it is so multi functional bowl!I sincerely love my dining table because it was so easy to assemble and also the deep chocolate wooden color looks perfect in my home.

", "Worth the price, but if it were a bit sturdier I would probably pay double without batting an eye. This table is beautiful, a true statement piece. Moved to a new town to work as a resident physician. I sold my old desk and needed something new and simple to be used as a work station. Accidentally came across this and it was perfect! It's about 120in wide by 75 in deep. Very smooth surface. Nice table for my small dining area, which should be comfortable for 2-4 people. The wood is nicely finished and it looks great.  Build quality is solid, it was easy to assemble and has a sturdy posture without any hint of wobbling. Solidity, Strength, Durability. The first time I bought this model was in 2018. It was absolutely stunning. One beautiful piece of wood, very sturdy, great table. Since then my living situation has changed and I wasn\u2019t able to keep it. I reordered it towards the end of last year. When I received it it had a small crack on the edge of the table that was barely noticeable. As a single woman with no kids it\u2019s easy to look over as I rarely use it anyway, plus, I have a \"1 Year Worry Free Warranty\". Since then that crack has grown exponentially even with minimal use on that part of the table. Upon further inspection, I realized this table is not the same quality and it now made of what appear to be wooden slats fitted into one another. This significantly lowers the value in my eyes although the price of this table has gone up since the first time I bought it. I\u2019m still within my 1 year warranty so I\u2019m contacting the company to see if they\u2019ll make it right. I would greatly prefer a replacement to the original model from 2018 with one solid piece of wood instead of these slats which can have more faults and break easier. I\u2019ll update my review accordingly when I get a response. I got this table to replace a much smaller table. The space  cant accommodate a huge dining room table and I didn't want to spend too much money so then this table comes in. It's very easy to assemble, you're just attaching the legs. It looks great! Affordable, stylish and easy to assemble but also light (I don\u2019t want to call it flimsy, but it\u2019s teetering on that) and the top has already sustained some very serious scratches just from mild use in under a month\u2019s time. Contrast this to a butcher block table I made from a pre-cut slab from Menards that has taken a beating for years without showing much wear. I was looking for a small light mid-century style dining table for my apartment and looked at various options before I decided on this as it's in the right style, color, price range, and made with all pine wood.  It arrived very quickly with the Prime delivery\u20142 days after I ordered.  When I was unpacking, I was quite impressed how carefully the packing was done\u2014 plastic wrapped styrofoam blocks, with cardboard reinforcement in every corner, and legs neatly encased in smaller boxes.  It also came with a great wrench tool (this alone has a great value) to tighten the screws, some extra sets of screws, nuts, and washers.  Once unpacked, my roommate (a petite woman) and I put it together in a matter of 10 minutes.  It fits in my small dining area perfectly offering ample dining surface for 2-4 diners.  I paired it with a couple of Pottery Barn's Liam dining chairs in Mahogany colored wood.  Because the table top is of natural wood and not laminated, I use a table cloth or placemats to protect it.  Out of all the small dining tables I've owned, this is my most favorite so far.  I hope this lasts me a while. I bought this after searching for a real Mid-Century Modern dining table, but coming up short because I also needed it to be small for a small space. None of the actual vintage tables seemed to fit the bill, and if they did, they were way out of my price range. I ended up ordering this table after seeing the great reviews. I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase! The quality of the table is excellent. Real wood throughout, solidly built, and very simple to assemble. I loved it so much I ended up purchasing other furniture items this brand makes. Bought this table for our dining area(s). We move quite often, so I wanted something that looked nice and modern, yet was easy to move and assemble with limited tools and time, as well as be sturdy enough to survive multiple moves. ", "Seriously. Buy this table. Other reviewers aren\u2019t kidding, it lives up to the hype! This is a great, sturdy table that is perfect for apartment living. The only thing I'll say is that the color is much more orange than expected \u2014 I thought it would be more of a natural oak or pine from the photograph, but in person has much more red tone and orange in it. Not a deal breaker, but just something to consider. It didn't end up matching any of the rest of our furniture, but it wasn't big enough of a deal to return. Still a great table. The table is very nice quality and feels very sturdy.  Wood is nicely finished and the colour looks true to the photos on the listing.  Super easy to put together too, and the included ratchet really helped. I absolutely love everything about this table. It came in a large box with excellent packaging. Tons of Styrofoam but all of the styrofoam was encased in plastic, so there is no clean up! This is wonderful. The table itself was super easy to put together. I put it together on my rug so as not to scratch it. It came with an allen wrench, and they even send a little ratchet just to put the legs on the table. This process took maybe only 10 minutes and the ratchet was so nice to have with it. I commend them for that. The only thing is there was a small flaw on the top of my table but not enough for me to send it back. I didn't notice this until after I attach the legs and flipped it over. The wood does seem to be a little on the softer side so curious as to how it will hold up to dings and Marx. But I can't say enough about this table. It looks great. Easy to put together. Appreciate the thoughtfulness they put in the packaging and adding the ratchet. This was literally the easiest piece of furniture I've ever had to put together. This table is amazing! It's thoughtfully packed; I assembled two different pieces of flat pack furniture today from two different companies, and this one was far superior. All the corners were protected by styrofoam inserts, all the styrofoam in the package was sealed in plastic (no styrofoam snow all over the place while I was unpacking and assembling!), and the hardware was blister packed on a cardboard card so nothing was roaming loose in the box. It came with the usual L-shaped hex tool, but Zinus also included their own branded hex tool with a nice handle that was much easier to work with. Eight bolts and you're done. The instructions have large, clear diagrams. The package also included an envelope with a thank you note and blank cards to send to friends/family. This company cares about its product AND its presentation! This is a beautiful, all solid wood table, not the cheap, heavy particle board covered with plastic \u201cpretend wood grain\u201d.  It arrived promptly, carefully packed.  And BONUS! It included the socket AND THE RATCHET WRENCH needed for assembly.  Nobody does that!!!  As a result, assembly was fast and easy!  The corner legs are slightly angled to add stability, AND they spread just to the table corners.  This means a very solid table with no leg trip hazard.  This compact, elegant design has room for chairs at both ends as well as the middle.  It will seat 4 easily, and could accommodate 6 in a pinch. I usually dont write reviews mostly due to laziness but I felt compelled to write one for this table. I had looked on other sites for a mid-century modern dark wood table and was looking at spending at least $150-200 and some of those were even wood, just pressboard. when I saw this the reviews were pretty good so i gave it a shot and im glad i did. We bought this table in espresso for a small dining area in our new apartment based on the Amazon reviews and were not disappointed.  The packaging was great and it was very well protected.  Assembly was a breeze.  The finish is absolutely gorgeous.  We have a small space in this apartment but don't expect to be here long-term, so we didn't want to spend a fortune.  But now we love it so much and will plan to use it in some capacity in our next place as well.  We got the \"Poly and Bark Wadsworth Fabric Dining and Kitchen Side Chair with Metal Legs in Walnut Wood Color, Grey (Set of 4)\" to go and they pair perfectly. The table top had a 7\" crack in the wood down the middle on one of the sides. Was marred on one side of the table for a length about 7-8\". The finish on the table top surface was also uneven. Cumbersome to pack up to ship back. So if you order, it is useful to only open one of the shorter ends of the box and slide the table out to check if it is OK before opening multiple sides of the cardboard. My order also came with a great deal of shipping tape around the edges of the box. Made me wonder if the item had been returned before. One of the unlucky ones to get a damaged item. Best to check the reviews in the 'most recent' sequence. In doing so after I ordered, I noticed there seemed to be more negative reviews for damaged goods than seemed to be in the past. Returning. This table is absolutely gorgeous! For the price, the quality of the table and the sturdiness are unparalleled, in my opinion. This is the fourth product I've purchased from Zinus, and they always package their things with extreme care. And so far, everything (including the sofa I got from them) has been in one box. They also include free blank greeting cards with each purchase, so that when you have a need to write a 'thank you' letter, you can use one of the cards. ", "I just finished putting the table together and not only does it look great, GOOD GRAVY was it easy to assemble. (I managed to do it all on my own in 10 minutes while also keeping a toddler occupied.) Thank you, Zinus, for including the allen wrench ratchet along with the hardware. I didn\u2019t even know such a tool existed and MY HEAVEN did it make screwing in the leg bolts faster and easier. (That little bit of consideration for my convenience alone makes me want to buy all future furniture from Zinus.) This table is perfect and you can't find a better deal for real wood anywhere! Believe me I've searched and searched for months. It's a beautiful color wood (slightly lighter than Espresso), with natural wood knots and graining. It's strong and solid. A great size for smaller spaces but still comfortably holds 4 chairs. Assembly couldn't have been easier!! It took me a total of 10 minutes to attach the four legs with the provided tools. The company is wonderful and it was delivered the very next day. I highly recommend and am so happy with my purchase I am incredibly impressed with the quality of this table. I was expecting that for the price, the wood would be more on the cheap/lighter end. But once I opened the box it was quite nice and sturdy. Assembly wasn\u2019t difficult at all, I had it put together in about 5 minutes. I was most impressed with how well it was packed, since some of the reviews had stated that their tables had been damaged during shipping. This bad boy was literally foamed from every possible damage point. So even though the box did have some damage to it, the table was untouched. Keep up the good work guys! Firstly, I bought this table at under $150 - so I feel like I got a tremendous deal on this. In the middle of remodeling my dining room, my nice table broke beyond repair. After searching for a new table for a couple of weeks, I decided to order this. It is a nice table that will hold me over until I decide what I want. It took very little time to assemble and is quite sturdy. The table by itself looks a little weird, but once I put my chairs with it, it looks nice. Once I get my permanent table, I will still keep this and remove the legs to store it, then use it when I need an extra table. The packaging was one of the best I have ever seen for self-assembled furniture. It definitely didn\u2019t arrive damaged! Looks great and came in good condition. Table was really easy to put together and the size was as anticipated. More ideal for only 2 users, but you can definitely get 4 people around it if you want to without issue. My only gripe would be that I purchased one of the slightly cheaper ones that said like new and there was only minor damage to the packaging, but came with a minor crack in on corner. Granted, that may have happened in shipping to me, I have yet to contact customer service for any sort of resolution. Very nice, well-made table.  Very easy to assemble, with a very good, tool-box-keeper ratchet wrench. All you have to do is attach the legs.  Style-wise, it\u2019s very Scandinavian/minimalist. Love it.  Perfect size for 2, 3, 4.  The wood is lovely.  The packaging was excellent. It\u2019s very sturdy and has a nice heaviness to it.  For an area like a small dining nook, you can\u2019t beat it.  Perfect.  Doesn\u2019t overwhelm the area, yet looks classy and classic. Whoa this is an awesome table! I love putting together furniture and this was EASY! I also cannot believe how great the packaging was. This table has a smooth surface (which I\u2019m always concerned with when I buy wood furniture). The legs are smooth too! Incredible table and company! The price was more than reasonable and the table is sturdy and gorgeous, assembly was so easy it only took one person and I took a call during the assembly so most of it was done with one hand! It was packaged with SUCH care, even the styrofoam was wrapped in plastic and as a cat mom can I just say... such a huge deal. Such a little detail but honestly the worst thing about getting furniture is the little styrofoam pieces all over the house for the next week. Only complaint is the color, I got the espresso and it\u2019s really not that dark and the color just wasn\u2019t for me. But keep in mind I\u2019m horribly picky and I just used a bit of sandpaper and some gel stain I had sitting around, I just couldn\u2019t return the table it was so gorgeous! Bought the natural color, which costs more than the darker version. Well worth it. Absolutely beautiful table. Zinus the manufacturer goes above and beyond what you'd expect from most businesses these days. Arrived on time and as someone else mentioned in their review, the packaging was superb. Even though there was a sizeable dent in the delivery carton, Zinus packs it so perfectly that there wasn't a single scratch or dent on the table. Very easy to assemble and it comes with the tools needed and extra screws and washers. Assembled in about 10 minutes. I love this table. Enjoy! ", "I needed a smaller table for my space. I have an ear in kitchen but still wanted something big enough for 4 and add two in the end when needed. This is working out perfectly.  It was packaged better than any furniture I\u2019ve ever ordered. The styrofoam is wrapped in plastic so it did not cause a huge mess opening.  The table came without flaws and easy to put together. You only need to put the legs on. Even comes with the needed tools. This table is perfect for a small space! It\u2019s solid wood and was a breeze to assemble. It was packaged extremely well and arrived faster than promised. I\u2019ve seen so many mid century modern tables at higher end stores for hundreds of dollars more than aren\u2019t even solid wood. I\u2019m temporarily in an apartment now, but I can also see myself using this table as a desk once I\u2019m in a larger space again. I\u2019m so happy with this purchase! I love this little table, it fits great in my kitchen and was so easy to assemble. However, I noticed after writing a shopping list at the table there were marks that were left on the surface.(I was using a regular ball point pen on a sheet of notebook paper, not pressing hard at all) So now there are a few words visible under certain lighting. Also my cat has fell off a few times as it is quite slippery. Other than that, it's a cool little table. Overall, this is a decent table - it seems pretty solid and looks nice, especially for a $100 table. That said, I was very disappointed with the finish on the table. As you can see in the attached pictures, there are \"stripes\" on the table. There are glossy stripes, which is how I would expect it all to look, and dull/rough/cloudy stripes. It appears there isn't near enough varnish on the table and I'm concerned that the table won't look good for very long because of it. My other complaint is that the table came with a gouge on the corner of it (can be seen in picture). All things considered, I would not buy this table again. I'm a big fan of mid-century and I guess I turned my son into a fan as well. I gave him a choice between a few different types of tables and he immediately chose this. We purchased this for his first apartment and it was a good choice. This is a solid smaller table that seems like it can take a little abuse. It was a snap to put together and it's really easy to clean. You can sit four people at it comfortably and six when you need to. You can't beat the price for what you get and it was definitely a great purchase. Just put my table together (took maybe 10 minutes) and am super happy with it! Packing was super secure, all the pieces were neatly arranged and secure so nothing was damaged in shipment. Table is super sturdy, the hardware they included was top notch and the little ratcheting tool was a much appreciated extra. This table is exactly the size needed for my space, and I'm super pleased with it! Will update review if anything comes to light. My wife and I are at a stage where we don't buy the kind of furniture sold by a large Swedish company that makes you build it yourself. However, we have a newborn daughter and discovered we needed a table ASAP to use as a second changing table, diaper station, etc on the main floor. I bought this but worried it would feel flimsy or look cheap-- I am very pleasantly surprised. Went together easily and it looks like it cost 2x the price charged. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Highly recommended. I like the table for the price. Real wood which is a plus, but scratches very easily. It actually had a few dents on the top of the table that I noticed after  taking it out of the packaging. Would recommend for small space. Only gave 4 stars based on it not being in perfect condition. I\u2019m a small female who just helps out when we put furniture together in the house. I had just moved into an apartment that has a small dining area and I thought why not get this table. I mean it\u2019s a dining table for $124 AND free shipping to my third floor apartment? I\u2019m sold! It took maybe a day to process and another 4 days to ship. This table has to be one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon. It's VERY easy to put together. And the packaging was very thoughtfully done with what looked like branded guidelines and instructions. ", "This was an unbelievable experience. I ordered one table and had to replace it three times!!! All of them came defective.  All of them came defective as wells as all of the tables were packed promptly, so I believe Amazon does not check items they are selling. I am glad I did not pay a lot for that pain, but I would not recommend paying more than a hundred, because there is a possibility that you will get the same defective item. Was really surprised that this table was packaged as well as it was. I ordered a table previously from another large company and the table arrived with chips and dents in it. Not so with this table. I was able to set it up by myself in less than 20 minutes and it is sturdy and real wood! I get comments about it all the time whenever people come to my apartment. I love how well it fits the space and how it\u2019s so easy to clean and care for. Wish I could give a Negative rating for the sturdiness. I have been using this table for less than a week and there is a CRACK !!!!! Unbelievable!!! I wonder how this price of furniture has such good rating !!! I trusted all the reviews and went ahead and ordered this peice of junk . What kind of wood is this . I have owned a dining table from ikea and it was way way better than this . So so disappointed. Will definitely be returning It\u2019s such a cute table but it\u2019s so poorly made... the minute you try to wipe it down it starts puckering up like water is getting stuck under the wood... It\u2019s really nice for the price! The staining is fairly even. There are some rough spots on the legs and sides of the top but they aren\u2019t very noticeable. We cheated that to the wall. It handles cleaning and our messy daughter well. I\u2019m not sure about longevity, but it\u2019s a great small space piece if you don\u2019t mind it not being like the best of the best. We ordered this table from Zinus after being entirely satisfied with their plateforme bed, but we're definitely not with this product. My partner and I are very please with this table. It was well packaged no dings or marks on the table. Super easy to out togther. They provide all of the tools and they even threw in some thank you cards that you can give out to friends and family. I thought that was kinds neat. I will definitely be buying from them again. This table is exactly what I was looking for! It's super easy to assemble, it's not super heavy, and it fits perfectly in my small dining area. My dining area is about 5x8 with a walkway that adds another 3 feet, so 8x8 total, and this fits right in. The surface does look like it would scratch easily but that's not a concern for me since its just me using it but if you have kids or are rough with your furniture I'd keep that in mind. Another thing, the pictures with 2 chairs on each side are probably using really narrow chairs but if you use one on each side you can fit 4 quite comfortably. It is so cute and sturdy. The best part is that my son, who is 11 years old, put it together himself. The only reason I gave it a four stars is because I wish it would have been a little bigger. It's more like a desk table not for kitchen. I really like the color and overall look. In the future I will be purchasing a bigger kitchen table and using this one as a desk but for now it will be fine. The table has great quality, it is wood and very easy to put together. I only had to screw the legs in it took 15 mins, that's it. it has a Scandinavian look. I am using it as a desk and it has big enough surface to fit laptop, your books, notebook, plant and  a stretched cat. I highly recommend it! I am working from home and the desk is working well for me my chair fits right under, just the right hight. It is also sturdy but not to heavy to move. ", "Small table seats 4 comfortably with room for all of your plates, glasses and a few serving dishes. It came incredibly well padded and the hardware is very nice heavy duty screws and washers. Even the tool they sent to assemble it with is a sturdy little ratchet instead of a cheap Allen wrench. I paired it with some cool MCM chairs that I found at a thrift store and it looks amazing. Great quality, we got the natural colour which came as described. It's sturdy and great table at an affordable price. This table is lightweight, but sturdy, and very stylish! It was the perfect choice for my apartment. Note that it is soft wood, so if you slam or drop a hard object onto it, it will probably leave a mark, but for the price you can't really expect hardwood. Overall, I really like this table and recommend it! This table was an excellent purchase. It is easy to put together and looks exactly as pictured. The wood feels solid and even has a grain to it. The table is not pressed ply-wood with a sticker varnish. A very solid purchase, would highly recommend! I LOVE this table! It was so easy to put together, it literally took me like 15 minutes (if you watch VPR you should know I tried to do it in under 7 minutes) to assemble. I am pretty sure it is real wood, as it smelled pretty heavily like that for the first few days, and it is pretty heavy and sturdy. This table is much better than I expected. It was packaged very nicely in plastic wrapped styrofoam. Included was a handy ratchet which made the assembly a breeze. The table is sturdy and looks super cute. I can highly recommend this company and will gladly buy from them again, without hesitation. This table is a dream. I love that is is real wood and the color is so beautiful. Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Perfect in our small dining nook. Can seat four people comfortably although most of the time it\u2019s just two of us using it. Don\u2019t hesitate on this if it\u2019s the size you\u2019re looking for All around wonderful table for the price\u2014easy to put together, sturdy but still light and does NOT look like cheap particle board if you\u2019re wondering like I did! The only negative is that the wood is very soft and scratches easily. After about a month there are already 3-4 large scratches on my table just from normal wear and tear (we use it as a kitchen dining table, so mostly for breakfast and dinner and it\u2019s just 2 adults). Wish it had a sturdier too because the scratches are pretty obvious! Still happy with the purchase, looks perfect in our space and was affordable. Table looks great and was easy to assemble. I love that it is real wood and not veneer. It is very light weight and the wood is very very soft and it dings very easily. I probably would not recommend it for a family with kids. My guess is after a year it\u2019s not going to look very good.  It already has multiple dings just from things like coffee cups and plates. It might be better as a desk than as a kitchen table. I received my table about a week ago and I am very happy with it. I only had to attach the legs which was not difficult. Today as I was cleaning the table, I felt something coarse. I looked closer and noticed a crack almost to half the table. I\u2019m upset because I love the table and I don\u2019t want it to get worse. Ugh! Make sure you check it thoroughly!! ", "Good company to deal with.  Timely delivery. It arrived when they said it would.  Easy to install and they also provided all the tools to make it that way.  Only con is how easy the top surface of the table can get scratched, but l did read reviews about that and still bought it because of the size being perfect for our kitchen dining area.  I just use placemats every time to help it last. I couldn't be happier with this table! It's gorgeous and beautifully made, and was a cinch to put together. It completes our small kitchen redo perfectly. It came in pristine condition, packaged wonderfully, and even with a thank you note from the company, which always means a lot to me. Highly recommend! Ok so this is not being used as a dining table in my house, its a spare table in an office, but it is so nice and the look is seriously better in person than on the site. The office is all higher end mid century stuff and this fits right in. If you are trying to feed more than 2-4 people at it then it may not be the table for you but for a small table at this price point it is amazing. I bought this to use as a modern, clean line desk.  I needed the large size because I have 2 large monitors, a Wacom tablet and large keyboard.  It is absolutely perfect for that.  The quality of the table is far better than I anticipated.  It's solid wood and looks great. This is a great deal for a solid wood yet light weight dining table. It's length makes it almost not so great for a small dining area, BUT it is a smaller table for 4 and fits in my small dining area. Definitely rectangular shape, not square. I have the natural wood one and it's beautiful. It's not exposed raw wood you can stain. It was smaller than expected but works out fine for our family of four. I guess it could sit 6 but you wouldn't be super comfortable. It is a Beautiful table but dents fairly easy. We were looking for something functional and aesthetically pleasing that wasn't expensive. It works fine... just dont let your 3 year old band her fork on the table. The finish is a lot more orange toned wood than I expected. It's a great little table, well made and packed. They even send a little ratchet tool, not just an Allen wrench. Nice lines and style, great for a kitchen or small dining area. My  only complaint is the color. I LOVE this table. It\u2019s the perfect size for my little family. The darker wood is beautiful. Very cute mid century modern feel without the mid century modern price tag. The only reason I\u2019m leaving off a star is because while putting the table together my husband chipped the top so I\u2019m willing to bet this table won\u2019t last. That being said, I only bought it to be temporary while we live in our apartment anyhow and for the price, you can\u2019t beat it! You get what you pay for... looks nice and easy to assemble but quicky disintegrates. The \"wood\" is low quality and super soft. After just 2 months of gentle use, I got multiple dents in it. The staining is cheaply made and started coming undone. When I contacted Zinus, I got a \"though luck\" sort of response. So much for their questionably deserved reputation for outstanding customer service... Great little table. Just make sure to double check the measurements, it's a little small, but perfect for smaller apartments. It was packaged well, and came with everything needed to assemble. Came with two different tools, plus extra screws and washers. Assembly took maybe 15 minutes, and I was taking my time with it. Very happy with my purchase! ", "This table was a bit smaller than I anticipated but it was incredibly easy to put together and has a very modern yet classic look in the Espresso color that I like very much. The ratchet tool in the assembly allowed me to put it together in under 4 minutes. Very well packed.  Easy to assemble.  Study and true to the color.  I only bought two chairs because I worried that it was to small for four, but for me, it will be easy to fit four chairs, but I advise buying the table first to make that judgment on your own.  Literally finished putting it together 10 mins ago and cannot wait to use it.  Will update with pics when I have my chairs. For only a little more than $125 this table is an excellent value. Good simple craftsmanship and packaged well to arrive in good condition. In a certain light I can see a little touch-up on damage to the top of the table that occurred before it left the factory. If I had paid $300 for the table this would be an issue, but truly it is barely noticeable. The company includes a little set of cards for you to send on to others with a very small marketing logo on the very back. It is a simple and unobtrusive idea, and I loved it. I will be happy to purchase more items from this company in the future. This table is attractive and fits our small space perfectly. We can easily seat 6 people at it. The main issue is that it nicks so easily, that the top looks horrible after only 2.5 months of use. I would not recommend this table if you want to eat at it as a spoon can easily mark up the table. Writing on a piece of paper with a pen also destroys the table top. I contacted Zinus through their website about a flaw in the table top (missing glue between two wood slats)  and they never responded.  I would not buy this product again and I do not recommend. Received earlier than expected. However, one of the legs I received was missing a nut and so I could only attach it to the table with just one screw instead of two. It is a nice table that I planned to use as a game/informal dining in my family room. The table however has a strange dent right on the table top. Ruins the otherwise nice top.  I did not using a table cloth, but, the dent is noticeable. Not in a place where I might use a runner.  Uggghh . . . I resigned myself to the fact that you get what you pay for, and this is a very aesthetically pleasing, sturdy table. Especially for the price. I will not end up keeping it as long as I would like because the tabletop is made of such cheap wood, that any pressure from on top of it creates an indent. For instance, I was taking notes on a sheet of paper and if I put too much pressure on the pen, I found that it left exact shapes of the words I was writing as indentations on the wood. I now have a big \"4\" etching right where a place set would be. I liked the small insert from the company...it was a nice touch. However, polite notes can not detract from the lack of sturdiness the product presents. Unfortunately will have to replace sooner than later if the wobble in the Table Legs is any indication. This table was delivered quickly and easy to assemble. However it is an example of \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d. The whole one edge  was scratched up (in picture). It is a nice sized table. But with the way it is designed. Do not mean on the long size. It will tip. In love with this table as a desk. Solid wood (no particle board), incredibly easy to assemble, very study and comfortable as a medium-sized desk in a small space. ", "After some initial frustration due to the box being delivered to a residence down the street,  the table is in the house; and I could not be more pleased. I did have to carry the box half a block, but once once I got it inside then unboxed it and assembled it, I appreciated all over again the unpretentious quality and simplicity of Zinus products. One of the legs was missing a furniture pad, but I had a spare. Beautiful table. So easy. Thanks, Zinus. Pretty much as expected. Seems pretty sturdy. I have two computer monitors set up on it. Bottom is of table is a little tight. Legs and table top are smooth. It's soft wood, as such it's easy to dent. I absolutely love my table!! It fits perfectly in our small home. And I am particularly keen on the rounded edges with such a little guy toddling around. Assembly was a breeze! The table arrived in great condition, however as other reviewers mentioned it is a softer wood and can easily be scratched and dented up. But for the price and the lovely minimalistic modern design it fit the bill perfectly! I have been able to seat up to 6 people comfortably. I also think it would make an excellent desk, as hubby and I are contemplating purchasing another for our bedroom office, then combining it for larger dinner parties. All in all a wonderful buy! I highly recommend! This is a great table for a small space.  Assembles in twenty minutes and I have zero carpentry skills.  Very easy instructions, they send a ratchet just to have it, spare parts and three cards to mail to people.  The table itself is real wood and very sturdy.  All the other positive reviews on here are accurate.  Great product! Overall a nice table. Good for small places. It has some flaws... I have attached the pictures. Check it out before you buy it. If you don\u2019t mind these, then I would say it\u2019s a purchase. I\u2019m indeed very picky..... Product packaged VERY well. I was like \"that's excessive.\" But it arrived beautifully so it was all worth it. My only grievance is that the wood is very soft and impressionable. Don't drop or slide. Probably going to get a glass top and it will be perfect. Easy assembly,  it was together about 15 minuets after unboxing . I ordered mine used, so I came with a few battle scares but, I gotta say, for the price this is a solid table, certainly on the smaller end but I use it as a desk and I love it, no BS carcinogenic glues or any nonsense, just a quality table. Wow! The packaging was so perfect! The vendors should have all of their furniture packaged this way.  The table came in great condition. It\u2019s small perfect for my apartment living. Everything was super easy to assemble. Love it! Love this look, color, styling and edge. Only drawback if any, is it's light so slides easily on bare flooring and you must baby it a little to keep it looking nice. Contrary to other reviews my experience was amazing!! It got here a day early, it was super wrapped up and even the foam was wrapped in plastic so it doesn't make a mess. It was in good condition with no cracks or flaws. It was SUPER quick to put together!! Eight bolts...thats it. The size fits the space and this was worth every penny. ", "Basic table, nice looking, clean lines, and all wood!  I was pleasantly surprise!  Also, the maker takes the time to do a very nice packaging job, and all the styrofoam is wrapped so you don't end up with white balls going everywhere (as some other furniture I bought the same week). Pros: this table is great for small spaces. I love the modern look of the legs and went great in our small dining area. It looks great and it's pretty sturdy. The only con about it is that it doesnt take much to scratch and dent the surface. I noticed some scratches on it and at first I thought they were trash from the boxes and as I felt one with my fingernail, I ended up making a dent. Literally made a dent on the table with my fingernail. I guess we really need to be gentle with the surface. But for the pricing, it's not too bad. just arrived today ! carefully packaged so it wouldn't get damaged and seems to be a nice little sturdy table. Easy to put together in like 5 minutes. I love it! I knew this item would have some wear as I purchased it used but one of the legs is completely missing the threaded inserts. Now I can't insert screws and hold the leg to the table without them. They probably fell out when it was being disassembled but including them with the other hardware is what should of been done. This is a very important part that will not be easy to find if possible at all. If the sender has these peices I would appreciate having them. Other than that the table is exactly what I needed. Very easy to assemble. It is literally just screwing on legs. Came packed very well. If you are debating which color to get, know that the dark is not as dark as the word \u201cespresso\u201d implies. It is more of a walnut with a slight hint of cherry. I did not want super dark so this was good for me. Great for small spaces and well worth the price. For $400 I expected a bit sturdier of a table.  There were scuff marks on one that was clearly opened and sent back and then resent to me in different packaging.  It is very beautiful visually however I am not sure how long this table will hold up. First I would like to say what a great table this is. It's ideal for a small dining room and it's solid wood. The packaging was so well thought out and it shows that the vendor took the time and thought to consider their customers. Great job. I also love the tools and cards that came with it. I would definitely recommend this item to all that are looking for a great deal with quality. I'm very disappointed in the delivery of the table. It's  a cheap table so it's not shocking, made in China.  It's probably a dual issue of carrier handling and cheap quality.  I'm hoping the replacement will come with no cracks! Pretty spiffy/thoughtful packaging and design, similar to Ikea. Easy to put together. The finish on the top is pretty soft and thin however, and seems easy to scratch. I assembled this alone and it was very easy. It's very simple and fits in my apartment nicely. It's not heavy so it's easy to move around as needed, and it looks very nice. Great price too! ", "This table is good quality, easy to put together and fits perfect in our small kitchen. Great piece for the price. I wanted to contact the seller directly before leaving a review but I can\u2019t find where to do that. Received item and it looks exactly like photo, was easy to assemble and it solid and sturdy. Unfortunately it is damaged in three spots - two corners are scratched/jagged and a divot in the top. I like the look but the damage of a brand new product is disappointing- especially something so big/such a hassle to return. Exactly what I thought it would be!  Packaging was very good, maybe too good - the styrofoam was wrapped in plastic, so there wasn't an issue with any mess. This table is smaller than a lot of others, but still a good size if you have limited space. The value is great. All of the parts seem to be very solid and it all comes together with high quality hardware. It even came with a ratcheting driver for the screws, rather than just your standard wrench. This made it one of the easiest pieces I've assembled. The company even sends a nice little thank you note. I would buy it again Ordered this table for my new place. I was so surprised when it came, cause I thought it would be the fake wood almost everything is made out of now. This table is so pretty and the wood is beautiful. It was super easy to put together and came without a scratch. I was seriously surprised when I got it. It is a smaller table and fits 4 pretty tightly its more for like 2-3 people. Would definitely recommend. This is a pretty table but the legs on the table I received actually tilt inward instead of outward as shown in the picture.  I have never seen a table made like that and assume it is a manufacturing defect.  That reduces the stability somewhat. Real wood, great table, amazing deal for the price. This was so well packed there is no way it could have been damaged in delivery. Came with a sweet ratcheting hex key for easy and quick assembly! Fits nice into our breakfast nook, however, it\u2019s not super sturdy and after just a few months, the wood is already splitting. Not sure how long it will last but disappointing after just having the table a few months and rarely using it. Super happy with the customer service and assembly . However, the table scratches easily, VERY easily. The packaging and instructions were super customer friendly and I love the notes/cards the company sends but wish the table top was a little heavier duty. Really nice I use it for a desk it\u2019s perfect size and ezy to clean off for art and other projects it would make a great small space dinner table but  not for a large family ", "Best dining table I've ever bought. Also the first one. Great nonetheless. Very easy to assemble, feels high quality and perfectly matches the color pallet of my living/dining room. Fits 2 fit humans on each side. Pleasantly surprised with this table, it seems pretty sturdy. The top scratches easy, it\u2019s a soft wood. But just wanted a cheap table that could double as a desk. We\u2019re happy with it! Great table. It shipped and was delivered quickly. Table came perfect no nicks, debts or scratches. Extremely easy to assemble, took all of 15 minutes. Just looks great in small space. Table is smaller than it looks in pictures I feel. But the quality of it makes it overall makes it a very nice piece to have. Would recommend if you live in a apartment with limited space. Or would like this as an office table. Would and probably will buy this table again for another space in my home. I really wasn't expecting much but this table is lovely, a great size for a smaller space and really super easy to put together, it's really lovely looking too.  Happy with this purchase I love how easy it was to assemble this table. It works wonderfully in our small breakfast area. It did arrive with a small blemish on the tables surface but I think it just add some character. Zinus seems like a cool little company! I don't know why everyone said they were having troubles putting this together. It was very easy for me and took only about 20 minutes. The table feels great, and I am really loving it! Incredibly easy to put together! Looks great in our small kitchen. No dings or damage. Great look. We have had the table for about two months, and we have already noticed scratches in the table from just normal use. A fingernail can damage the table if pressed in hard enough... We loved the way that it looked but unfortunately are not super happy with the quality. This was the best assembly experience I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m amazed at the quality of the product for the price! Packing was incredible! I had the table out of the box and assembled in 15 minutes. You should absolutely buy this table! Very nice quality, zinus will never disappoint you. I made one order and there was scratch on the surface, I scheduled the return and ups came to pick up the next day for free! And I made another order, It was delivered on the next day also! Very satisfied with this service and product! ", "Assembled this table in less than 10 mins, super easy. Unfortunately when I screwed the last leg on, I found the corner of the table pretty damaged. Super pretty and seems very sturdy and fits perfectly in my small dining space so I\u2019m exchanging it this time, hoping to get one that\u2019s undamaged this time. I was so excited for it, so it sucks I had to return it and wait for another to come. If the next one comes damaged, I\u2019ll just ask for a full refund. I just received this table the other day and love it. It\u2019s a great size for four people. It was so well packaged. Instructions were extremely clear and easy to follow. The company sent extra supplies (and tools!) in case you lose anything when assembling. I still can\u2019t believe this was such a great price. I am really impressed with this company and will be purchasing from them again for sure. Easy assembly, and much more sturdy than I was expecting for the price point.  It's also a beautiful, simple peice.  I highly recommend this table for a smaller dinning space.  You can comfortably fit four people at the table for an intimate meal, but it's small enough that the table won't take up every last inch of square footage if you have a small place.  It's perfect for apartment living.  I highly recommend. Seems like the quality of this product is  way better than advertised. I'm a single woman living alone, and the tool that they sent (a tiny ratchet!) was soooo helpful. I put it together by myself and it looks and feels great! This table was incredibly easy to assemble, and I love the way it looks. The one thing I wasn\u2019t thrilled with was the color - the espresso is a warm mahogany color and not a cool dark brown like I expected. This is a great table! Very easy to put together, well-packaged, and can seat four people. Real wood \u2014 not particle board. Felt pads were already added to the table legs. Nice detail since stick-on felt pads always fall off. We put two tables together to fit 8 people. Could also be used as a desk. I could not be happier with this table! Looks just as pictured & was a breeze to install (& came with a super helpful ratchet tool) Had some trouble with delivery getting lost at delivery but I found it and I\u2019m so happy with the table! Super easy to assemble and love the wood, simple design. This is a wonderful table.  Came perfectly packed & in perfect condition.  Assembly was a breeze--tools included.  It's easy to move around---light but sturdy. Gorgeous, beautiful, love, sturdy, stylish, the only thing I didn\u2019t realize is that it has these places where it\u2019s evident that they just glued together the planks of wood, so you can definitely tell it\u2019s not a high end wooden table (the picture I took shows what I\u2019m talking about)... I don\u2019t really care about that though, but someone might. I love it. Perfect for the price. ", "The assembly of this table took me no longer than five minutes. All I needed to do was to attach the legs to the table. The table is a bit on the short side. If you have wide chairs then it is going to be crammed on the long side, but this also makes it suitable for small space. I love the design of this table. My primary complaint is that the wood scratches very easily. I would love it if the packaging was a little less wasteful, but I admit it did do a good job of protecting the table during shipping. Extremely easy to assemble and quick. Very sturdy. However mine did arrive with some cracks in the tabletop. Which I'm hoping they resolved quickly. Wanted just a big table for my desk and this is exactly what I wanted! Super easy assembly and I appreciate the time they put into packaging and the branded ratchet it comes with for assembly (totally keeping it!!!) Thanks \u2764\ufe0f I got this table for 114 bucks while it was on sale and while it felt relatively a good price, I was super pleased with how the package came - very thoughtfully packaged by Zinus and the finish on the wood top and legs was super smooth and clean. It made me want to be careful with how I used it so that I can keep it \"perfect\" for longer. Fits four chairs easily and is a perfect dimension for urban spaces. Easy to assemble with easy to follow instructions but no matter how much you tighten the legs it is extremely wobbly. I think it might be because of the design and the way the legs are angled. It's good for a small space but not the type of dining table you take with you to your next place. I'd say it's worth the price and worth keeping for 1-2 years. Like the package and everything. It\u2019s a light table with not much material, even this, they don\u2019t manage to smooth it out better and fill-in the little cracks on surface. Therefore a lower rating. Love this table. definitely a great size for an apartment.  Can comfortably sit 4 people. Was a great small table for a small space. It was easy to put together and looked smart in my kitchen. Love the mid-century modern look. This table was incredibly easy to assemble and arrived in perfect condition. Fits 4 chairs comfortably, highly recommend for couples or small families! Thanks Zinus! ", "I mean, it\u2019s a cute table, but the material is so cheap! Mine came with a big scratch not surprisingly, because it dents and scratches with any sort of bump. I guess you get what you pay for.. This table is beautiful and sturdy. The colour and style are great. We have a small kitchen/dining area, and this was a great fit, it was easy to put together, and is very sturdy! So easy to assemble! Great quality and sturdy I wish I had gotten a darker table but this one fit great in our space and was easy to assemble. Came with all the tools needed and took about 30 minutes to put together. Love this table! It's solidly built and looks great. The packaging is amazing, prevented so much styrofoam from going all over. Overall, happy with the purchase based on what it looks like and also the product descriptions which were accurate. Love how our table looks in our dining area and found some chairs on Wayfair that totally go with this mid century vibe! Happy to share the chairs we got if anyone is interested. Just opened and assembled this great little table. Unfortunately, I bought the table specifically because the measurements show a 28.3\u201d to the bottom of the skirt. The 28.3\u201d measurement is to the underside of the table and not to the skirt. The measurement to the skirt is more like 25\u201d (which does allow my armed chairs to fit under). Pretty table BUT one corner was messed up upon delivery. I put some old English on it and it made it visually okay but I kind of resent paying full price for messed up furniture. Bought this to use as a large surface desk. It is perfect. The materials are nice, it arrived securely packed, and it\u2019s both light weight and sturdy enough to manage by myself. The finish is pretty. I love it. ", "Looks excellent. Was very easy to assemble and with tools provided the legs will be easily detachable incase you plan to move into another home. Love the modern and simple look and that the table is lightweight and sturdy. This table is so aesthetically pleasing yo the eye. It is so easy to assemble is almost perfectly sturdy and great for a smaller sized dinning area. I would 100% recommend this mid century modern wood style table. Great quality wood! Finally found real wood on amazon!! Easy to put together. I m very slow at putting furniture together, but this took me 15minutes max. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this table looks.  We needed a small table for the corner.  Easy to assemble and matches our wood flooring. Perfect! It's well made and easy to assemble, but unfortunately the wood is waaaaay lighter than it looks online. So unfortunately it doesn't match the rest of my apartment. It's much lighter than it looks. I ordered the \"natural,\" which online looks like it's more of a walnut, but when it came it's very light, almost like a pine. Oh well. What did I expect for the price, I guess. Bought this as a table for standard apartment \u201cdining area\u201d. Fits perfectly with four chairs (two side by side OR one on each end). It was very easy to put together, too! I bought this for my kitchen. It arrived without the proper tools, instructions, and screws to hold it together. It's been days since Zinus has gotten back to me, and I'm pretty disappointed since I have this unassembled table sitting on the floor now. The customer service is slow. If it was quicker then perhaps I would've rated it higher. This table is beautiful and it's just the size we needed. Two chairs can fit comfortably on each side. I was impressed at the fast shipping- we got it a few weeks earlier than the initial shipping estimate. The table was packaged very carefully and each foam piece was even wrapped in plastic to prevent any mess! The extra touches like that, and the high quality tools that were included exceeded our expectations. Nice table for my temporary dining room situation. I love it it looks great. This this table is cute. But the material is cheap, it is not durable at all. It came scratched and with dents. I am return it asap. ", "Better than expected. This table is very nice quality for the price. Color is lighter than a true dark \u201cespresso\u201d, which is what I was hoping based on the photos. I\u2019m not a fan of super dark colored furniture. Very easy to put together. Really smooth surface. Perfect for my studio apartment. Very sturdy. Looks great. Lovely size. I was concerned about odor from other reviewers. But it was not an issue at all. Very pleased with this very cute table The way they package this product and ease of setup was amazing. High quality all around. This table is great. I did give 5 stars even though in person the \"Natural\" is lighter than in the picture, BUT it is natural so can't dock point there. Assembly took 10 min with their handy screw tool. The shrink wrapping styrofoam so it doesn't get everywhere was genius as well. Good size modern looking table for a single family or someone who's just single. Swipe right on this table. Such a cute sturdy little table!! Easy to put together and perfect for my apartment dining room area :) would defini9tely buy again This table is perfect for my little apartment! And it only took about 5 minutes to assemble, love it!! This table fits perfectly in my apartment. I decided to get chairs from a separate store and was worried they wouldn't match, but they totally do! My point is, this table works easily in our space. The wood is sturdy and a good weight. Very simple essembly with the tools and fasteners provided. Doesn't wable at all. Really enjoy seeing products deliver as advertised. I\u2019m in love with this table! Super easy to put together and good quality and very stylish! I love it! It was so beautiful in my small apartment. Only thing is that the wood is soft, so you don't want to write on it or put heavy pressure as it will leave marks. Discovered that quickly, but that's just wood. Otherwise for normal dining it's great. It's incredibly easy to build, I totally recommend it! Love this table! So easy to put together and looks really nice. Great quality for the price. ", "Impressive packaging, arrived promptly and it was so easy to assemble. And the table is just beautiful. Great company and great product. So easy to assemble. It's sturdy and doesn't wobble. Very good wood and craftsmanship. Would definitely recommend. Loved this table BUT after 3 months, there is a huge crack down the middle. I have never put anything heavy on it unless you consider a plate of food heavy. The table is cute and the color is pretty but very disappointed It's well packaged and I really love the tool they provided. Looks great, real wood, easy to put together and really good value for money. Very happy with this purchase. Never assembled it, so I couldn\u2019t tell you if it was sturdy, small enough, etc. The table came damaged. It has scratches all over the face of the table. Noticeable scratches all over. Had it been a couple, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, but since it was all over, I decided to go through the hassle of returning it. Bought for my small dining area. Very nice finish and solid wood. Worth the buy Great for our tiny kitchen seats 4 easily. Depending on chairs can sit 6 This is a nice table for the price. I used a clear gloss lacquer on the table top to protect from scratches, spills, and chips; since pine is a softer wood. This table came in superb packaging with a nifty tool for assembling easily. It\u2019s sturdy and just the right size for my small dining area. I\u2019ve gotten many compliments on it. ", "It came with this amazingly handy ratchet tool, which made assembly a BREEZE! I also have a Zinus mattress and love it, which is the only reason I bought this table, I'm very glad I did! But it is quite fragile and gets marks really easily. We always have to be extra careful. This table has been perfect for our small dining room. It fits four decent sized chairs underneath it and is very sturdy. It has beautiful, simple lines (I especially love the look of the legs). I would recommend it if you have a small dining area but want a table that actually looks like a dining table rather than a kitchenette table. Resl wood, beautiful and modetn! I was so surprised how much I loved this table! It\u2019s perfect for small apartments and small dining areas. The quality is excellent and it looks extremely expensive. It\u2019s very sleek and modern looking. Also the assembly took me 15 mins. Highly recommend this product! It's a light table very easy to assemble ( I managed it in 10 minutes). Just amazing! Can't tell you how impressed we were with this. Not only solid wood, but easy assembly and just perfect for small spaces. Also, the packaging was so convenient, as the typically messy styrofoam was efficiently wrapped in plastic for easy clean up. I purchased this table as a breakfast table for my kitchen.  It has lovely elegant lines and a nice light wood finish.  I am very pleased with it. This table was very easy to assemble (>5 minutes) and came well packaged with a nifty little tool and nice hardware. It looks great in our apartment,  and the wood looks and feels high end. The table also came with several sweet greeting cards to send to a friend, which was a nice touch! Delivered without a scratch on it!  Great quality for price! Easy assembly. ", "Significantly lighter color than the photo led me to think, definitely a natural-pine looking finish. Perfect size for a small desk, which is what I wanted it for. I bought the darker table and its so beautiful! If you have a small space I would definitely recommend. Super easy to assemble and looks like it was more expensive than it was. Also, bought the Coavas 4 chair set in yellow and fits so perfectly together! I'm using it as a desk. I was fortunate nothing happened to the desk in shipping, although there was a hole punched through one side of the box. Otherwise, I agree with another reviewer that it was thoughtfully packed, beautifully finished and very easy to assemble. This table is attractive and sturdy.  It was packed well and attaching legs was easy. very nice table quick delivery easy assembly. I'm very pleased This small table is perfect in my small space, but it isn't really espresso. It's a lighter shade of brown. It was exactly what I expected for the price. A nice, simple style, with soft wood. But after only one month, a huge crack has started running down one of the corners of the table  top. It just happened on its own - the only use I\u2019ve had out of the table is having a textbook there. Annoying considering how new it is. Beautiful, simple design. Strong and well made. I really do like this little table for our small space. Unfortunately it's beginning to crack as shown in the photo. I had read this was a problem for others as well, but took a chance because we have purchased other items from this company which we are very happy with. I really love this table, it's easy to put together and it looks cool! ", "Table is perfect. Was packaged very well, no damage. Extremely easy to assemble. Looks beautiful. Very happy.

I bought the suggested chairs and they were all easy to assemble. Perfect for a small space. Love this table! High quality wood.  Great colour goes with anything.  Size fit our breakfast nook to perfection!  Easy assembly with only 8 bolts that screw on the legs, the rest is done.  Excellent packaging and fast shipping. Have to return due to 2 cracks (3\" and 4\") on the  short top side. Otherwise it could be a great table, easy assembly too. Without the 2 cracks. Love our new kitchen table. It is perfect. We didn't want big and this is just the right size for 4 people. Zinus makes furniture easy to assemble. Very easy to assemble. Nobody else does it. I was surprised at how beautiful this table is.

It\u2019s perfect for a small space, also. Stable, reliable, clean lines *This is an honest review. I\u2019m not getting anything in return for my comment. * Just the perfect table for a smaller dining room area. Love the color and how it was easy to assemble. Horrible item all the way around.

It's super easy. ", "Sturdy, balanced, well constructed, easy assembly. Clean attractive appearance. A little smaller than I expected--more the size of a desk--but nicely made. Quick and easy to assemble, the ratchet tool they provided was helpful and sped up assembly considerably. Lots of padding bits and pieces to dispose of; the box itself had some gouges in it, so the extra padding was worth it. Well packaged and beautiful table I loved this table, super cute, sturdy, easy to put together...but sadly, I was writing on a piece of paper with a normal ballpoint pen and it made marks under the paper on the table that won't come off.

It\u2019s not made of solid wood, but it\u2019s still well made and looks great. Very lightweight, incredibly easy to put together and move, and arrived well packaged. A great product from Zinus! Nice to have that little side table in the kitchen. All wood clean modern cut. Love it. Sturdy, simple wood table. Love it for my space, great for apartment living! [This review written by Dave's daughter Raylyn, who uses his account:)] This table looks good, fits 4 chairs comfortably and feels pretty solid. Exactly what I was looking for for my small apartment Packaged well and assembly was simple. It is sturdy and lovely and just perfect for my tastes without breaking the bank. The table looks nice and the aesthetic of it is exactly what I was looking for without breaking the bank but after a couple of weeks of having it and barely using it I'm starting to notice cracks on the table so I know it will not last me long at all. Would not buy again. Perfect for small spaces. Most compared to a size of a large desk. Great quality, color, sturdiness for the price. Something you\u2019d pick up in Target or home goods. Doesn\u2019t have a weird sticker which is what I was afraid of. Also the color is more of a pine and not walnut or acorn ", "We love this table. It\u2019s perfect for our little dining room and fits four chairs comfortably. More than four would be a squeeze, but this table is an amazing value. Perfect table for four people! Perfect little table for my small space. The actual color is darker than pictured which I'm happy about because I didn't want cherry looking color. The best part is that it's all wood which makes it a great deal at this price point. I love this table. We have a super small kitchen so this fit perfectly. It's easy to put together and very sturdy. This table has a great design but the wood is super cheap. It scratches extremely easily. I tried gently cleaning off a dab of glue and the wood scratched and you can see an indentation on the surface. It\u2019s more like cork board. Extremely light, very easy to assemble (didn\u2019t even take 5 minutes), and looks amazing for the price! The table looks beautiful and does appear to be of solid wood. The light brown shows the the natural grain so any imperfections blend in. The table top is heavier/sturdier than the legs. The only complaint is that the table does scratch/damage easily. We have a zinus bed and we're happy to have our second purchase from them now.  Very good table for the great price. Easy to assemble, fits in perfectly, true color, stardy and nice looking. The color is beautiful the table is beautiful but very small. Well a lot smaller than I expected, had some scratches when I got it. Went together quickly & easily with little ratchet tool they include.  Looks nice, very sturdy & compact, but room for 4 for meals.  Very good buy. ", "The table was well packed with lots of protection for the corners. There were clear instructions and it was very easy to assemble. It's a nice table for the price, but it does look a bit cheap. I really love the look of this table but mine arrived slightly damaged (see the picture). It looks like it was pressed up against the box of legs included in the packaging and enough pressure was applied to indent the table. I\u2019m a bit disappointed and was hoping for a better experience with Zinus. Nice piece! Solid wood and easy to assemble. This was absolutely a good purchase. It was package perfectly. Gives me the mid century feel I was looking for an affordable price. I love it. So good for price, cute, love the color I'm very satisfied with the overall look of this piece of furniture. It works well in my small kitchen. One needs to be aware that the table top wood is soft and marks from the pressure of pens will be left on the surface. It was a nice table. First delivery the color stain on the table was not finished , one side was without the stain. The second table came, everything was perfect and within a week the nods of the wood started cracking, little by little all of them got cracked, we had to return it and honestly I don't trust the brand any more. The table and finish is beautiful, I wouldn\u2019t expect years and years of use because the finish is very soft and can scratch very easy. Not meant for tons of weight either but for a budget table it\u2019s great. I could not be more please! What a phenomenal all wood produce for the price. I bought it for $103. I highly recommend it As other reviews have said, this is great quality and easy to assemble. Very happy with the purchase! ", "I like it. I\u2019ve ordered this table in the past and it was in perfect condition. This time, the quality of the wood/appearance was poor and definitely not made the same as the previous table. It also cane damaged, although the box it was delivered in was still intact. Really excellent quality. Everything packaged nicely including the parts. They send you a little ratchet wrench which makes assembly so much easier. I would definitely recommend this table for small spaces. I will buy from this company again. Nice real wood feeling and looks more expensive than it is. We are currently using this table as a desk against a wall, and it's so easy to move into a more formal dining position in our small place. It provides flexibility of space as well as plenty of wrestle room for our pups. :) This table is awesome! The color is nice, it\u2019s great quality, sturdy, and good for a smaller space. We could have went with something a little larger for our space, but this was in our budget. It can seat 4 or 6 comfortably as well. I may repurpose it into a desk if we decide to get something larger in the future. Really nice piece but has a bad crack in the table top. Only noticed after putting  it together because crack is on one end. Too heavy for me to put in my car and take it to usps and return it. So guess I have to try to fix it somehow. I could not be happier with this new table. It is beautiful, sturdy, was easy to assemble and reasonably priced. It is the exact color it appeared to be online. It is just an all-around great quality table! This table feels sturdy, looks great, and was easy to assemble. 5 stars. This table is SO pretty!  I was about to buy almost the same at IKEA for 50$ more and paint it darker, then I saw this one that was exactly what I wanted! Arrived in two days and was super easy to build, I\u2019m so happy with my purchase. ", "Sturdy, looks good and does the job. It's not fancy but that's what I wanted. Received it on time. Top surface has a damaged/scratched mark in the middle of the piece. It\u2019s pretty noticeable. It was our first time purchasing furniture online so little disappointed with the quality. Otherwise, it\u2019s a decent wood table. Easy to put together. Liked the fact that the table came with an extra tool to tighten the screws. It came broken The best table I've ever owned. Sturdy, and SO easy to assemble. Great buy! Well packaged and includes the ratchet tool. Solid wood and very pretty! I have sat 6 people at this table ( 2 of them were kids) and I works but probably more comfortable for seating 4. I love this table. Easy to pit together. Very stylish Will quickly get my money's worth! Sturdy and easy to assemble. Should hold up well! Loved the color and slim style . One person can assemble this and move it around . Perfect table, so easily to put together! My exboyfriend has this exact table in the light color so I knew to expect great quality! Works perfectly to seat 4 in a studio apartment, I already squeezed 6 people in too! Not the largest table, but it is nice quality for the price and works well for us.

The assembling is surprisingly easy for me and the looks like more expensive than actual price. Also it\u2019s simple and fits all rooms. Also easy to assemble and light, better with a rug to prevent slippery I love the table and it would've gotten 5 stars if it wasn't damaged. I never turned it over until after assembly so I didn't know if it came that way or if I damaged it during assembly. It's a great table except for the two dings. Near a corner, the item came slightly chipped. Unfortunately, I will have to re-pack and return. This was a little smaller than we thought it might be however, the table exceeded our overall expectations. The quality, look, and how it completes the room. I was worried this would look/feel cheap but when it came in I was pleased by the quality. Realized you can probably fit 6 chairs in total for how small it is. Nice. Easy to assemble. Neat and clean packaging. Cheap. Could be better. A good size for a small space. Lighter color than it appears in the picture. Sturdy enough, I like it! Styrofoam in the packaging is wrapped in plastic which is nice it does not get all over the place. Good table ", "I love the style and color. It is a bit tight with six chairs! Love this table. It was easy to assemble, and was perfectly packaged with care. Assembly took about 20 minutes, and table was ready to go. Sturdy wood, and very happy with my purchase.

I\u2019m really in love and it took maybe 4 minute to put it together. Thank you for making it so easy!!! This table was easy to assemble and took less than 30 minutes for my sister and I to build.

Stains and scratches easily, but overall great product. Great quality!  Just like the description.  It was so easy to assemble!  I love it! I got the table super cute and elegant but super small. Probably fits 2 people. It could fit 4 but with tight space. So this would bebbetter for a breakfast table. Not for a dining table. But super cute. Great price and came with tools and extras that made it super easy to put together. It took my boyfriend no more than 20 minutes to set up. Awesome! This table is stunning! Lightweight, easy to assemble, perfect for my small townhouse dining room. ", "Great table and well built. Super simple to set up. Came with a black smudge on the table top that I can\u2019t get off Great for small spaces, easy to assemble and easy to clean. Would buy again if I needed too.

Extremely easy to put together and organized packaging, looks and feels better than more expensive tables. Absolutely recommend. Absolutely gorgeous, super easy to put together.

DONT PUT ANYTHING HOT (coffee mug) for an extended time. It will mark it! Looks nice but it\u2019s a soft wood! It makes dents very easy. I guess you get what you paid for. Spend some more money and get something that isn\u2019t so delicate. Definitely not good if you have kids. Super neat package and nicely manufactured table.

For a small apartment , looks fancy and the material seems great Pleased with the fact that it is real wood, and so clean cut. Excellent deal for the price! Sturdy and looks good.

The picture speaks by itself. So easy to put together and it looks so cute in my apartment!

Well spent 100 bucks. Terrible table. Cracked in the corner right of the box. Love love my table It was boxed well. It was easy to assemble. It looks just as the picture depicts. My only complaint is I noticed the wood on the table top isn\u2019t smooth. One corner feels like it is buckling (can\u2019t see it unless you\u2019re eye level with the table, but it make me wonder if it was from not being real wood). Other than that it is lovely. To err on the safe side, I have coasters down for people to place their drinks. This table was great and fit nicely with the chairs I bought until we actually started using it. My daughters and I do homework on it and to my disappointment the words she wrote got marked on the table. How delicate is this tabletop? disappointed .. wish i could return it This was my first ZINUS product, thought it was a fluke how good the quality was, but after buying a bedframe (not knowing it was the same company) I'm 100% sold.  Like I said in my other review, I hope this company isn't slave laboring people because I want to recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Easy to put together, instructions were simple, quality material, great design and affordable pricing...I sound like a damn pitchman.  Anyway, I don't usually review stuff but I thought it would be good juju to throw out some love. Very easy to assemble, looks just like the picture.  Seats about 4, good for a small space. ", "First this came well packaged and easy to understand instructions.  I received as a gift and was not looking forward to putting together but it was very simple. It's really beautiful and very sturdy. I am absolutely in love with it. I purchased this table to use for my computer as I wanted an executive desk but they are pricey. The measurements for this table fit what I was looking for, it was easy to put together and is very comfortable to sit at. I did buy leg risers to increase the height by 1\" but that is because I am tall and like my workstation to be a bit higher, not a bad reflection of the table itself. Included a picture of my set up for reference. Beautiful!! Just like in the picture. Arrived on time. Super easy to assembled. I loved looks modern and Mid-Century. Great table, great price. Extremely well packaged so there was no damage but now I have a lot of styrofoam to trash. Nice wood. Very easy to put together. Just attach the legs and done! This is definitely most suitable for a small space. The compact table fits two slim dining chairs on each side but barely. Very high quality table! We have a small apartment and this table is the perfect size. The quality is superb and the packaging was beautiful. We really like it a lot. The table was easy to assemble. It is lightly tinted. We found it is easy to clean that oil stain does not penetrate its surface. The table is stable. I will recommend it. Pretty sweet given the price! But a bit stiff. Easy to install the legs and feel confident they're secure.  There was a lot of twisting,  but the directions are so simple and, really, you can knock it out in 10 minutes if you rushed or had someone to help. I'm a single mom and I was fully able to do this in 20-30 minutes.  2 screws (or nuts&bolts; idk tools well) per leg.  They provide two things to help screw, making it much easier once I got close to the insure corner,  so I didn't have to keep lifting my hand away after every half a twist.  I share a 1-bedroom with my daughter and I love this table.  Perfect size and appears mid century modern.  I bought the white chairs on amazon,  too! I get endless compliments on this table. I paired it with teal Eames style chairs. I love it. Works great in our tiny dining space. Just me and my daughter so we don't need a huge table. ", "Looks nice in the kitchen. Attractive and simple lines. Good finish and very sturdy. Easy too assemble. Love this table for the price!! It\u2019s real wood and I have gotten so many compliments. It\u2019s not extremely sturdy but it\u2019s not rickety either, I\u2019d definitely buy again. Very nice table.  Area is still a work in progress.  Highly recommend Color and quality are great and its so easy to put together This table is sturdy and easy to put together and looks great from a distance. The wood finish is not amazing since you can see little sawtooth lines from where the planks come together, but I think for the price it is a great deal and a good comfortable size for 2-3 people. You can fit four for sure but it won't be as comfortable.

I wasnt sure what to expect for the price but it's a cute and sturdy table. Took about 30 minutes to put together. Some reviews mentioned bad packaging and scuffs on the wood but I did not have that experience. I dont have any complaints. Would buy again. First and foremost, I strongly advise against using power tools for assembly because you really need to feel the torque as you assemble. If you truly need to use a power tool, be extremely careful. I did all the assembly by hand. I bought this table because I needed a smaller one. It's perfect for my needs. The little drawer is a bonus. It works well for one or two people to eat at or use to do paperwork. I like the colors. I have no complaints. I would purchase again. This would be a definite 5 stars except for one thing, which might be a deal breaker for some, but not me. The top of the table is not smooth, but has a textured feel to it, almost like the grain was exposed and needed just a small bit of sanding.  I assume that is intentional. It does not look flawed in the least. I almost wanted to put a coat of polyurethane over it, but I had already purchased a clear vinyl 30x30 table top protector (also on Amazon). My intention for use of this table is not for sitting down and eating but as a prep table.  I am 5'0\" tall so the normal countertops are too tall for comfortable use for me. This table is the perfect height for short people. It is VERY sturdy and attractive.  The drawer unit is already assembled.  All that is necessary to complete assembly is attaching the legs, which is a breeze.  Just a little hint - I put the table together in one room and attempted to move it to the kitchen - not a good deal for me because my doorways were not wide enough. Just had to remove two legs and reassemble. Bottom line is I love this table.  Placemats would take care of any texture problems. Did I mention the table is very attractive? It is. I'm very happy with this table purchase. Such a good price. Table is sturdy, attractive, and a nice size. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble. Drawer was the most time consuming but not difficult. Metal slides were pre-assembled and I couldn't pull them apart, so I was unable to secure the table slides with all 3 required screws. I only used two but drawer is working fine. Assembly was relatively easy once you figure out how to detach the sliding mechanism parts. Otherwise you can not screw all 3 holes to secure the sliding mechanism.  There is a black lever which you press down on, then you have to finagle the right pull to slide it apart.  First several times felt like this was a dead end because it kept catching but eventually, it slid right off.  This part took me over 1 hour. I am as unskilled and unhandy as they come.  The legs attach to the outside of the table.  I had to redo this because I attached to the inside.  Assembling the drawer was straight forward.  There are no written instructions, just pictures.  It all made sense once everything was put together, 2 hrs later.  Overall I\u2019m happy with the result.  It\u2019s sturdy enough for my computer and the drawer is so handy. Can\u2019t beat the price! The set arrived with all complete parts and looked great. I was so happy after putting the first chair together. But after building the second chair I realized that one of the legs was shorter than the others. Too much hazle to send back after assembling them. The first chair looks great. I have great first impressions of these chairs. They came packed VERY well including wrapping all Styrofoam pieces in plastic so you didn't get little pieces of it everywhere. Assembly was pretty straightforward and just to be safe I added a little wood glue on every point of contact. There were a few VERY minor flaws in the paint, but was only noticeable while assembling. These are the best chairs I have ever purchased beautiful comfortable easy to assemble I can\u2019t say enough nice things about them!! I bought these chairs to complete a farmhouse dining set. The chairs are beautiful and very comfortable. Assembly was not too difficult and I was able to put them together by myself.  The natural wood color didn\u2019t go with my dining room so I painted them white to match my decor. They took paint easily. I would definitely purchase these chairs again. ", "All three of the wood chairs, 1) the Amazon Raveena Home Solid Pine, 2) International Concepts and the 3) Amazon Classic Black Home Styles Ravenna, all pictured together are made well. We chose the first (Raveena Home Solid Pine) and returned the second just due to the comfort. At the table the first chair gives the most common lumbar/back support and helps posture while eating. The second is not comfortable, it's a reclining position. Dashed boxes to show the angle of recline. The chairs arrived very fast. It took me about an hour to put them together. Very easy....nice and strudy. Very happy with purchase. I also purchased the matching table, but not so lucky with that purchase. They sent me a very heavy chest instead of the table. I am 62 years old, and live on the third floor, so you can guess my anger when I hauled it up those stairs to find it wasn\u2019t my table. I am returning it and reordered the table.....it better be the right one this time I hate that the product description says \"No assembly required.  Enjoy your product from the moment it arrives\", yet assembly is definitely required, unless you get enjoyment from sitting on a pile of chair parts spread across the floor.  Or maybe you will enjoy sitting on a box which contains a disassembled chair. I have a small kitchen and no dining area and so needed something small that i can squeeze in a corner when not in use. This is perfect. It seats my small fam of 4 (including 2 toddlers) comfortably. it's perfect for 4 plates and a centerpiece. Awesome table. The one we had was round and to large for the space this one fits perfect. My husband  and I use it everyday.  Looks great in our farmhouse  kitchen. I would highly  recommend. It's not a bad looking table but the quality could be better. It's not 100% solid wood, the sides & drawer are composite wood, the bottom of the drawer almost feels like cardboard. The top is a rough rustic style, the legs have marks in the wood that look like clamp marks. It's cheaply made, I paid $41 so for that price it's a good deal but I wouldn't pay more for it. As it is now listed for around $100 I would like to compare it to some of the other brands available at that cost. This is an Amazon line of furniture that was promoted by House Beautiful. So, these chairs are a great value for the money! I would recommend them, and buy them again myself. Here are a few things you need to know: 1. Assembly is fairly easy BUT you really need a drill to drive the screws... a hand tool like a screw drive just wont cut it. 2. They look GREAT for the price except after assembly, there is a place on the side where the screw head is going to remain visible. A wooden cap would have solved this problem, but it's not included. Overall though, this is a great buy! I have some mixed feelings about these chairs. They look great around our dinning room table. There are some problems, however. One of the chairs had a big staple sticking in the top of it as pictured. The seat of the chairs appear to not be wood which causes me to worry about how well they will hold up to use. There are flaws in the finish in a few places which I wish was not the case. They are also a bit on the dainty side. All this said, I\u2019m happy enough to keep them. They do not wobble and seem to be a relatively good value for the price. My biggest problem with these chairs is the listing. The picture showed gray but the portion you select to buy said black. I assumed I was buying the black chairs but got the gray. So far they seem pretty sturdy.  The back supports don\u2019t fit completely flush and its a little uncomfortable at times when you lean against them. Overall a very good value for the money. Good quality construction, very sturdy when assembled.  Assembly is simple, I was able to assemble without assistance and I only have one good arm :)  My only complaint would be the stickers used to label each piece, they are difficult to remove and some are visible when assembled if you don\u2019t remove them. ", "Love these dining chairs! Well packed and arrived unscathed. Easy assembly with minimal steps. Hardware is well identified and organized. Chairs have an attractive appearance. Bought 2 sets to replace chairs at an existing table. Actually like these better than the originals. Very solid, yet sit well. A small rough patch on 1 (out of 4) chair kept me from giving them 5 stars. Very enthusiastically recommend these chairs. Chair wood started splitting as we were assembling. Also shipped two of the same legs- two left instead of one right, one left. Cannot get anyone at Amazon to respond to request. I don\u2019t want to go to all the trouble of shipping an already damaged chair back. One of the chairs is ok so I would just like them to ship me one replacement chair. Don\u2019t but these chairs. They look nice but cheaply made and not likely to last long. It said no assembly required but I should have known that was too good to be true.  However the assembly was easy. We ordered 8 chairs (after 4 boys my old chairs were hopeless) And had quite the assembly going so took less than a hour.  All seem sturdy and only 1 has a very slight wobble.  First night but so far so good. The table is awesome, cute, sturdy and small enough for the area I needed it in. Just what I was looking for, however, instructions were not clear on how to install the sliding mechanisms for the drawer. It didn\u2019t explain that you had to take the piece apart into two, or how to do that in order to screw it into the table and the drawer separately, then to put it back together to install it properly. That sucked trying to figure that out. But I eventually did and it\u2019s a very handy little drawer!  Very satisfied with my purchase! We read so many negative reviews about different chairs, that we were afraid maybe everything affordable was of a pour quality.  BUT - these chairs are just great.  They assemble in just minutes, they look nice, and while they are obviously of a soft wood, they are sturdy.  We purchased 12 of them for our venue caf\u00e9, and they're perfect.  Compared to everything else we looked at, these were the best overall value by far, and we're so pleased. I bought this as a kitchen table in April that I put in the bay window.  When I received the table I was amazed at the quality of the table at such an incredibly low price.  It was also easy to put on the legs and the pull for the drawer.  An allenscrewrdriver was included for the legs.  I've had it for almost two months and have been very pleased with it, and expect it to last a long time. Decent chairs, but you definitely get what you pay for. Quality control is lacking. one of the legs inserts did not have any threads. Couldn't figure why the bolt wasn't going in. Added some pressure...the bolt began to go, then the insert started turning and splintered the wood. Took bolt out and looked into the insert to find an unthreaded insert. Now I have to disassemble the two chairs to send back. Frustrating! And Amazon saying I have to wait 3 weeks for replacement. SMH. Happy about this table! Nice for the price! Recommended! Sturdy chairs. Nice look. Assembly was more challenging with a smaller allen wrench. I used a drill for the few screws. Still took about an hour per chair but perhaps I am a little slow.  By the time you do four you will be really good at it. Buy a handle allen wrench set to help. I was having trouble finding a table small enough to fit in our kitchen but wanted it to be quality, no particle board ect ect. Well I came across this table then, the price was right and this table is REAL!! It's very good quality not cheap! Looks wonderful in my kitchen! ", "Beautiful table. Drawer slides were a little hard to figure out. It was kind of dumb that the drawer didn't come assembled since cardboard in that shape was holding that space open in the packaging.  But overall it's a beautiful, sturdy table and price is good. I was trying to find matching chairs to a table that I got at Ikea and these chairs are PERFECT for what I needed. They are easy to assemble. They are lightweight, but also sturdy at the same time. I ended up buying another set because I loved them so much. We were surprisingly very pleased with these chairs! We weren\u2019t expecting them to be as sturdy and pretty as they are with such a great price. We bought cushions for them, but they are comfortable without cushions. The chairs were really easy to assemble. Really like this table. Very good quality. Having the drawer is a good feature for notes and stamps. I am in a wheelchair and I did all my Christmas cards on this table. Bought originally for jigsaw puzzles haven\u2019t tried that yet but I sure it will work. Love this table. Got it for my coffee bar nook Table is super strong and very pretty to look at Though I got this in June 2020  It was today Wow, I bought this table 2 months ago for$47. It's a good table at that price for sure... Worth $150? Not so sure about that. Pretty sturdy, honestly not, glad I snapped it up before they insanely raised the price \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f This table far exceeded my expectations , it looks great , went together very nice and looks prefect in my new apartment . The kitchen is done in white and oak , so this table fits in nicely . Came on time was packaged very well, love this table for my  small kitchen nook, will be getting the chairs that match.  If you need a small table, easy to put together in no time, this is the one.  Thank You Amazon ! Very sturdy. Looks great. They are as comfortable as a wood chair can be. My only complaint is you can see one screw on the side on the bottom crossbar. Clear instructions and assembled in less then 30 minutes for both. We are using them for kids homework area. Overall happy so far. These chairs come with an Allen wrench and the pieces are annoyingly vacuum sealed into some plastic. I feel like that is enough to explain how aggravating and how complicated something that could be so simple is made by manufacturers. If you love your environment, be prepared to be annoyed at the level of styrofoam that will come lovingly packed with your chairs. That said, once it's all done with, the chairs are lovely, sturdy and comfortable. ", "Great chairs! They look great and we\u2019re easy to put together. Great deal for the price! These chairs were perfect for our kitchen. The honey pine color matches our existing cabinetry. They are solid wood and well made.  My husband had no trouble putting them together. Great value! These are very sturdy chairs. I was pleasantly surprised when we got them put together.  They were packaged extremely well.  Very stark white in color , which is what I was looking for. I am really disappointed with thread chairs. They are very lightweight and I don't expect them to last long. They look good enough, but the quality is not good. I do not recommend these. I love the chairs. They were a little difficult to assemble but probably because I don\u2019t follow directions well. They are sturdy but slim. I would definitely recommend these chairs they are a great price for the pair. So cute! It isn\u2019t hard to assemble these chairs but it does take time. The color is true white and it\u2019s definitely as described in the picture. for a dinner table, what else. I like it because it fit perfect in my home. some of the holes for screws seemed to be stripped so be careful. other than that no complaints. I don't normally write reviews but thought this might help someone decide on these chairs.  I researched a ton of chairs online and couldn't make a decision.  I came across these chairs and thought they looked pretty nice, and were a close match to the color of our table.  We ordered them and were so excited to see the quality of them when they arrived!  So sturdy and easy to put together.  We love them and will be ordering two more to make it a set of 6! Took longer than the 20 min per chair another reviewer mentioned but I suppose it depends on the person. I love the material and they wipe clean very easily. Ordered this for my mom instead of spending $100-$300 on a table! This was easily the EASIEST product I have ever put together, literally only had to screw the legs on, looks GREAT in our apartment and it's perfect. \u2764\u2764 would 10/10 recommend. ", "The color is a lot lighter than the picture.  But the grain is nice and they seem sturdy.  Takes 2 people to put together,  but we did it easily Lots of scratches and indentations. Also, the drawer was installed upside down and my husband had to fix it. Very cute table though Lovely solid table for a fair price. Drawer was a bit difficult to assemble. But generally well designed and sturdy... It looks good, matches my decore. Not built for the long haul, but what do you expect from a Chinese product. For the cost it\u2019s a great little table. It\u2019s sturdy and pretty easy to put together. My two year old even helped. Not fancy, but nice and super easy to assemble.  Simply screw on the legs. Good value for the money. I was looking for a small table for kitchen.  This is a perfect size. Good quality too. Thank you Received one of the chairs with holes for seat screws in the wrong place, such that I was unable to put chair together. I will have to pay carpenter to try and rig up holes where they should be. This item was delivered quickly, in perfect condition, and looks beautiful in our kitchen. These chairs are sturdy and look good. We got these chairs to fill out a dinette set and they are a great match ", "Wow! Great looking and durable chairs. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. Also used a little glue on the leg braces. Very happy with purchase. I was suprised how sturdy these chairs are, and I'm a 250 pound man so i notice such things. Well built and solid. Other than a small defect on one of the support bars, these are a nice for the prices. The tall back makes these super comfortable. Assembling was quite easy and although other reviews mention a slight wobble the ones I received were just fine. Great chairs for our kitchen table. Easy to put together and look clean and expensive. Love these chairs, they feet very sturdy when we use them. The only thing is that one of them (just one) has slightly uneven legs and makes it a little wobbly. I love the chairs, and ordered 2 sets. However, when assembling my 4 chairs, I found that I had 5 right side braces, and 3 left, so I was unable to complete the 4th chair.  I would really like to get this fixed, but do not see any way to contact this company Nice sturdy chairs and quality! Pleasantly surprised! We needed two chairs for out kitchen table.  They matched wonderfully, perfect height! these are beautiful and go great with my new table! ", "perfect wood table for small space.  Greet look. Super cute simple gray chairs! I love it!

They went together easily with well organized directions and nuts and bolts packaging. The original chairs to our table fell apart with limited use. These chairs are simple so they easily go with the table. Very happy with the purchase and value pricing Nice quality. Recommend. ", "The quality is amazing for the price! These chairs are sturdy, well built and look really good! I couldn't be any happier with my purchase! Perfect table for my small kitchen! Sturdy and good value for the money Very easy to put together. The weight of the chair is nice and light. Comfortable to sit in. Besides some cosmetic imperfections on the bottom size that you can't see, these chairs are a great value! Sturdy, real wood, and look nice! We got two sets, and will likely be getting some seat pads to accompany but are happy with our purchase! Although the chair looks beautiful and feels very sturdy, my star rating is based on it came with NO instructions to assemble!  Took forever to put together because of that Good product, great price, beautiful color. I would buy it again. These chairs are beautiful. They were fairly easy to put together and are very sturdy. They were a perfect choice for my dining room. I purchased 4 of these chairs 3 months ago. My daughter sat on one the other day and it broke. Now I\u2019m outside of the return window and I had to order 2 more so that my set is complete. Very disappointed Just the right fit, price & style. Easy to build, as well ", "Our dining room table chair, I liked them but I did get a crack in one board were a screw goes in but it was very minor and still holds steady! Overall they are very worth the money! This table weighs about a half a pound and slides across the floor just by looking at it.  It\u2019s very cute and the size is right, but I\u2019m not happy with how light it is. These chairs are exactly what I\u2019ve been searching for! They delivered quickly and my husband was able to put them together without issues. Great price too! Chairs were a little harder then expected to put together.  They are comfortable but some screws have fallen out after they were put together.  Also we did get the second order after 20 days so I canceled it and requested a refund. I\u2019m very surprised with how nice these are. They\u2019re very comfortable and they were easy to assemble. I am super happy with these chairs - comfortable and not hard to put together! These chairs are very light and may not last more than 2-3 years. They are very bright white and stand out in a bad way. These are ideal for a low budget kitchen and are not nice enough to put in a dining room. Great product. Very sturdy and the look is perfect for any home style. Goes perfect with small spaces such as a studio. Will definitely look to see if there is a bigger one available once I move into a bigger place. Love the Style! These chairs I bought are excellent. High quality construction and sturdy, not super heavy. I love the modern style of these chairs. Bought a separate black dining table and it looks far better than slant set for sale. Recommend for sure! No assembly instructions included ", "Love these chairs...perfect! The chairs are a bright solid white which is what I was looking for! I love them! Disappointed in the finish in these chairs. We\u2019ve had them for about a month and the paint is already chipping on one of the legs. I wish this wasn\u2019t the case because everything else about the chair has been great. I loves it. Beautiful chairs! Very easy to assemble and very sturdy! I bought this used and it is still absolutely amazing! I use it as a writing desk in my study. Looks good in farmhouse style kitchen I love this table.  It fits in small room.  It looks really good.

I used a little drop of wood glue in each hole before inserting the screws. Only 6 peices to put together. Added cushions & sit great. This square 29.5\u201d Ravenna table stands 29\u201d high and is a good value. ", "For this price, I was expecting two pine dining room chairs that looked like they came from a big box store. Instead, I got two solid honey pine finished quality pieces of furniture. These chairs are a simple, timeless design & will easily fit into a traditional room as well as a contemporary setting. They\u2019re a generous (approximately) 21 inches wide x 18 inches deep and 40 inches high. The seat is 16 inches deep & the seat back is 21 inches high. The underside of the seat hasn\u2019t been skimped on quality. Three screws are counter-sunk into the bracing on two corners & on the other two there\u2019s four screws & two pre-drilled screw holes where the back is attached. The front corners are connected with dado joints. To assemble, the back slips easily into the seat & screws into place. The bracing from the middle of the back legs are attached then the front legs are attached to the seat & middle bracing. They go together quite easily & the instruction sheet spells everything out quite well. They\u2019re easy to clean, too; just dust with a soft, clean cloth\u2014furniture polish isn\u2019t necessary. Blot up any liquid that spills on the wood, don\u2019t rub or the finish can be damaged. These chairs won\u2019t disappoint. I love these  Ravenna Home Classic-Style Solid Pine honey finish kitchen table chairs. They have a beautiful finish, but it is a little rough in a few places. They are very comfortable. The seat is very comfortable. The back is constructed so my back was supported and leaning back during dinner was quite comfy. I didn't measure the seat height from the floor, but at 5' 6\" my feet were comfortably flat on the floor. I use a mix-n-match approach with my 6 kitchen table chairs. These 2 are beautiful additions to the overall effect. I keep using \"comfortable\" but that is exactly what these chairs are! Amazon combines reviews for the chairs and table (separate purchases). This is for the black farmhouse chairs, set of 2. As of now, I don't have the table put together because the directions are terrible. I can say that the top is a durable wood, that is solid. However, I already had an issue with the legs either rubbing together or against the top and getting scuff marks fairly easily, so I would advise to be careful of that. The drawer is a convenient added feature. I think the most confusing part that caused me to give up was the assembly of the drawer. The drawer slides look nothing like the picture in the instruction. The slides have metal parts that stick out one end and that is not displayed on the instruction so I had no idea how they were to be placed on the table. Overall, even without it being assembled, I'd say its a solid table, but the assembly is not simple all due to the instructions not being the best. Once assembled these are nice looking and sturdy chairs.  They appear as shown, the color is consistent with my expectations based on the photographs as shown.  All are level, and sit nicely.  My only compliant is that these were difficult to assemble.  It took some work to get the pieces to fit together evenly and the screws that were sent with the chairs easily stripped.  I ended up using my own screws to finish the assembly.  None of this was a particularly big deal to me, as I keep plenty of screws on hand and have a husband who is happy to help and owns a power drill.  These chairs are a very solid value, and having to put in a little extra effort is fine to have wood chairs at this price point.  However, if you do not have these things and someone to help you with assembly, you may wish to consider other options that are already assembled. These look pretty nice and I like the black color. Assembling these are not that easy and take quite a bit of effort, to be honest.  I love the style of these chairs and the wood is lightweight, which makes moving the chairs around quite easy.  But, because they are light,  they don't feel that solid and we have some bigger people in my family so I don't think these chairs are the best for them. (us? haha.) When I first received the chair set I was very happy because The chairs that we received were actually made with actual wood not compressed cardboard like we got from ikea. However, there are some cons such as The instructions are poor. It was very confusing while building the chairs. The drill holes don\u2019t lined up perfectly so we ended up throwing away some parts that didn\u2019t line up. Overall, these chair set could have been really good if they improve with the description and fix with the drill holes. This is a gorgeous dining room table thetvkm so pleased with . The quality of the wood is wonderful. I was so impressed with the packaging . All the styrofoam was covered in plastic as not to make a mess everywhere . Assembly was very easy and took less than ten minutes . I will definitely buy more from this company . Great little table. It's small and great for small houses and little apartments. I really like it. It also has a drawer so that way I can store things in it. Would make a lovely table for studying. Perfect and easy to assemble. Just attach the legs and the drawer. This table is lovely - good finish and paint. It's a nice size for a tight space or just an area you want to open up. ", "Overall these are nice chairs.  They do take awhile to put together.  They\u2019re not particularly difficult it\u2019s just that the instructions are very poorly written.  But once they\u2019re together they\u2019re sturdy and nice solid wood chairs.  They are also very pretty farmhouse chairs and look lovely in my kitchen.

For its size, it is weighty which makes it sturdy and stable. At first, I was concerned when I saw that the instruction sheet was only one little page. However, unlike other furniture I have put together, this was extremely easy to Assemble. It was just screwing the four legs onto the table in the right positions. Caveat, do make sure that you have the legs' slant facing the right direction. I also like that this table has leveling feet on the bottom. If your floor is not perfectly flat, you can easily unscrew the foot in or out a bit to level the table. It looks beautiful next to our German shrunk holding chess board.  All the laminate seems to be glued into place quite well, and it is a decent quality piece. This table is really rad. It came pretty quickly and is as exactly as described, but also HEAVY. I was expecting lower quality, but nah. Pleasantly surprised by this. I am using it as a plant table under my living room window, and I love it so much I bought the matching end table. Pretty solid piece with good build quality and no missing pieces. The legs are very sturdy and the screws provided are large enough diameter to make the legs feel well-secured to the table. Well-packaged although I wish they would have found a packing material other than styrofoam since it is not so good for the environment. This is definitely better quality than some pieces I have purchased off of Wayfair or AllModern for more money. Reviews were decent and hard to find this hairpin style as a bench this size so I went for it but 3 of 4 corners were damaged out of box, there are bubbles in the veneer which looks super fake/cheap, the legs are super thick which I think looks cheap and one of them was bent at the base where it attaches to table making it impossible to fully secure the screws.  I was dumb and I attached the legs before I took it all out of box just to make it easy so I didn\u2019t realize all the damage until it was already put together and at that point it\u2019s just such a hassle to unnasemble and try to repackage for return.  I will keep it and find something to do with it just because of the hassle but not super happy with it.  My opinion is that it looks like it should be about half the price and gave 1 star because it is heavy and sturdy even with one leg not fully secured. Like others mentioned it is quite heavy (still able to move and assemble with one person) and very sturdy. I bought it as a low console for my 55\u201d tv and is it great! The drawer isn\u2019t on tracks, which I like to be able to pull all the way out and also fits perfectly. Just buying even to get the hairpin legs is a steal! This table is awesome! We bought it with it only having 1 review and we were super nervous that it wasn\u2019t reviewed more. But the thing is amazing!! The drawer comes already installed in the table, and the legs screw on with a Philips head in minutes. It is sturdy and looks amazing in our home. Worth it. BUY! I sometimes seat on the floor and drink coffee, and height of the table is just perfect for me. Wood part is very heavy and looks beautiful. Love it! Bench is great! I really like the way I looks and it\u2019s heavy but no too heavy! I bought this table about 2 months ago. Haven\u2019t even finished paying for it. Very poorly made. Started chipping from day 1. The legs are heavy and sturdy. We\u2019re using it for a 55 inch TV. We wanted a minimal console. Easy to set up - just need to screw in the legs. ", "Its about what you would expect from a inexpensive coffee table. It is a MDF base with a thin veneer of wood looking material, not convinced it is a a wood veneer, but a plastic of sorts. Legs screwed on with some minor force, drawer does not close flush with the edge of table, but can be fixed with some spacers on the inside. the rounded corners are a nice touch and will save my ankles im sure. Looks great...from far away. It definitely looks cheap when you\u2019re sitting close to it because the veneer is so fragile! The corners were all in bad shape upon unboxing. On the upside, the table is very heavy, the legs are great, and the assembly is quick and easy (once you have a friend help you get it inside and unbox it, that is). I\u2019m going to have to repair the corners before they get any worse. I would return it, but it\u2019s so insanely heavy that I don\u2019t want to deal with a return. After waiting an extra 5 days for delivery due to UPS (not reflected in this scoring), the box had no tables legs!  Ok, mistakes happen right? I can\u2019t find a contact or email or anything to get the legs sent to me! I can only find links to return the table. Frustrating.  The table is mediocre.  I can\u2019t rate most of it because I can\u2019t put it together. I can\u2019t find anyone to contact to get the parts either! I have a very mid-century mod distinct style and was looking for a piece that would jive with the other pieces in my small apartment. I first eyed this desk in a photograph online and searched popular websites for it, not knowing the name or maker. To my surprise I found it on Amazon, and $200 less than another furniture site. Terrible quality. We bought this table at the end of 2018. It is now early 2020. We use this table maybe once every couple weeks to have friends over for dinner and play board games. Whole it looked great when we got it, now the veneer is bubbling up along the edges, the surface is easily scratched, and it just looks kind of shitty. It's not the greatest quality piece but it's done it's job. With more regular use though I can't imagine this table lasting more than a year. The table came missing 5 screws, and 6 are needed per each leg.  The screws were loose in the box, which was badly dented re-taped shut with side just open. The table inside had several dents and scratches from the loose screws and legs rubbing inside the box.  Badly packaged. I am using this as my Living room coffee table.  Love it!  Easy to assemble and this is a nice substantial piece of furniture! Nuce looking but, definitely, doesn't worth that money. I knew what I could expect ordering the Rivet Hairpin Wood and Metal Coffee Table, Walnut and Black in Used - Acceptable condition. In the past, I have made out well paying a fraction of the MRSP by choosing warehouse deals. I couldn't pass up $87.00 steal. The package arrived pretty much falling apart. I'm still not sure how it even made it to me in its box. As described, the table had some major cosmetic damage. It appeared as if someone took a few good whacks with the hairpin legs to the top of the table. Unfortunately, the package was desecrated, so instead of mending it up to return it, I decided to make lemonade from a lemon. I gave this product 4 of 5, because even knowing it would be slightly damaged, the condition of the package it arrived in, made it impossible to return. The table itself was still functional, even without the major face-lift. I just couldn't bare looking at the pitiful thing in the condition it arrived. Still a sturdy and beautiful addition. ", "As much as I like this table, I'm disappointed that it was not only missing parts when it arrived July 31, but that the drawer doesn't work properly either. I've been in contact with the manufacturer 3 times in the past month, and am still awaiting an email from them, in regards to when I can expect the missing parts/a technician to arrive. They in turn are still waiting on the vendor, apparently, which is creating the holdup. I doubt I will ever order this brand again, which is unfortunate, since I really like the style of their products. I bought the entryway/console size table. It works well in the space that I bought it for--an entryway in a split level condo. I needed a table that was the right size, MCM-style, and something that allowed me to see the doorway through the banister from the lower level. The legs are nice; they are substantial and seem like they would support the types of items I would place on top of the table. HOWEVER, the table came cracked on the bottom/underneath. I suspect this it due to a structural design issue since it cracked where the drawer started. The crack makes the drawer droop a bit on the right side, and the crack is only visible if you look at it from underneath, which would be when you're standing on the bottom level looking up at it though the bannister. (See the pictures.) I don't know how much weight the drawer will handle now, so I probably won't use it. I dread the hassle it would take to return the table, so I'm just going to live with it. I might try to fix it later. All in all...it's nice if it's not delivered with a defect. Does kinda suck that I paid full price for a damaged item. For $150, hard to complain too much; however, my table was also received dented on a side that I was able to hide in a corner.  This seems to be a common issue and Amazon should review how they are packaging these furniture shipments, it can't be entirely the fault of UPS/USPS/Fedex.  Table is sturdy and substantial enough, not too heavy or light.  Nice looking from a distance, up close you can tell it's cheap! It was very easy to assemble and sturdy. However it came with a corner damage on the top, discoloration where the veneer has been stores on the roll, and the veneer on the side was already cracking and lifting. Disassembled and returned. Too bad. Wish it wasn\u2019t veneer but solid natural wood top. Love the table! Looks great and has a good price point. Unfortunately, it was missing 3 predrilled holes. I am a 54 year old single woman who doesn\u2019t want to deal with drilling holes in furniture! Ugh! Other than the fact that I\u2019m going to buy a drill tomorrow, it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m probably going to buy a second one ... since I will already have a drill by the time it arrives. I absolutely love this table! I have it in my dining room as a kind of buffet/console table. The legs are sturdy, the entire table is sturdy and well made. I'm totally loving it! I got the matching bench which is by my front door. It makes me happy every time I walk in the front door. Bought the coffee table version of this ~9 months ago and I am disappointed.  It's peeling, scratching, and just much lower quality.  Lately I've been thinking about replacing it, totally forgetting I dropped $150 on it, thinking it was cheaper and easier to replace.  Now, $150 isn't exactly expensive, but it feels like the value just isn't there. Looked very nice and seemed sturdy, but some screws simply spun in the holes and wouldn\u2019t tighten, making it impossible to secure all legs. Returned. I purchased 2 of these for the living room.  They work great and are sturdy.  They can be used separately or pushed together to make a longer table.  I had to get 1 of them replaced as it had broken parts when it arrived. Much heavier and sturdier than expected. Purchased as a bench for both additional seating and to stick plants under my window. ", "I love this! I've been looking for a new coffee table for awhile that had rounded corners (I have a toddler). It's beautiful, sturdy, and a great price. Awesome, arrived quicker than I expected. The table was heavier than I thought, very good quality, and fits my new 50\" TV perfectly. The assembly was very easy, just screw on the legs. Great deal, love it as the night stand/side table for \"other\" side of bed.  Rivet doing really good things The first time I ordered this table it arrived with a large crack in the back of the tabletop. Even if it had arrived undamaged, it was also defective. One of the drill holes and set screws for the leg was never put in. I shipped it back, which was easy to do. The next one came with only 15 screws to install the legs. 24 are required. I kept the table and will have to go to the hardware store to purchase the remaining 9 screws required for assembly. The table itself seems very sturdy and cute, but the assembly production is lacking. This is such a good buy! For the price I was not expecting such a nice and sturdy product! I use it to hold up a 55\u201d tv. It\u2019s awesome that it\u2019s low profile which really makes it nice and grounded. The hairpin legs are so nice and modern and pairs well with the rounded edges of the base. It\u2019s a great buy! Bought it for my TV it fits a 65\u201d and I have space for some ornaments and it has drawer for the remote controls Love this table!! Used as a makeup area for teen\u2019s room. It\u2019s very sturdy, could come in handy for many different uses. Very easy to put together too. good sturdy product- received with product damage on left back corner of table and one of the leg mounting screws would not seat into the screw hole so I had to purchase one that fit.  no damage to outside cardboard box so product was shipped with defect (picture available upon request)-I did not squak because damage is on left rear out of sight!  jdb I just love it\u2019s look very well in my bedroom. It is hold my 43\u201d lg tv with my ps4 and Xbox one x. I my get another one Rivet Hair to match the one in my room. Thank you Great little table. It's elegant with excellent weight. Very easy to assemble. Worth every penny. ", "The materials feel a little cheap to the touch, but it looks great. Easy assembly and sturdy. I have my TV placed on top and some small cords stored in the drawer. I find it to be a great height to place a TV. Looks nice and works well in the space. Easy to to assemble. Sturdy and heavy little table.  Feels very solid, legs are thick and heavy metal. The matte wood veneer looks very nice as well.  Impressed! I love this STURDY coffee table.  It's so easy to put together.  It's a lot heavier than one would expect and it fits well with my decor. Really sturdy and it looks great with my other mid century modern furniture. Great price too. For the price, the quality is decent. The drawer is horrible quality so I turned that facing the wall and don\u2019t plan on using it. Laminate seems fair in quality. Somewhat disappointed but certainly not enough to return it. For the price, it\u2019s worth it. The design of this table is modern and beautiful. After a week the laminate top already had a scratch.  5 months later the top is covered in scratches and this table is very gently used. Given the opportunity I\u2019d save my money and buy something with better quality. This small table is perfect for sitting my HP Laser Printer on. They are almost identical size and it's height is perfect. An excellent purchase. The desk is super easy to assemble, looks good. I think it\u2019s a bit too pricey for what it is but it feels well built, only took about 20 minutes to assemble. This table is a darker wood in person then what it appears in the pictures. The metal legs stick so far onwards that it makes it difficult to fit two chairs under. The top of the table scratches incredibly easy and gives it a cheap undesirable look after a couple of weeks. ", "Arrived in great condition and was easy to put together. Electric screwdriver will make it especially quick. Looks good in my living area and very sturdy. We were unable to put the desk together due to poor quality parts some of the threads were stripped making it impossible to screw in certain parts.  While Amazon was quick to refund, we wasted about an hour attempting to put the piece together and then dismantling it and repacking it. Very attractive and super easy to assemble. The table feels very solid and the legs are much heavier than you would think by looking at the pictures. My only complaint is a couple of minor songs on one side of the table. I feel like the packaging could of been better to prevent those little dings Perfect for my gaming space. Super sturdy. This beautiful table was ideal for a smaller sized bedroom. It works perfectly as a tv stand for my 43\u201d;of course it could easily be used for a 60\u201d! It\u2019s modern and functional and a very fair price. See for yourself! Not a solid or substantial piece of furniture despite the photos The desk was easy to assemble and is good quality for the money. However, one of the screws at the bottom of the legs (used to adjust the height if on an uneven surface) is missing. I called Amazon support and the only thing they offered was to replace the whole desk (absolutely not). Looks like I'll be heading to a hardware store to buy a replacement screw on my own. Great table for behind the couch. Works as a nice accent piece with some decor on top. Small drawer but falls out easily when you open it, would reccomend putting much in it. Overall very satisfied! This is a great little table.  Purchased for a small conference room in our office; we needed something small on which to put a phone. Sturdy an good looking. Nice product but leg design makes it a little wobbly ", "I use this as a table for my succulents under a window. The size was absolutely perfect for what I needed. Great quality and easy to put together! Really happy with it. Pros: This is a real piece of furniture; solid. Looks great without being too obtrusive. The assembly was easy. Great value and piece I was very excited to get this desk but when I opened it it was already damaged. I think they actually sent me an opened box. It looks very cheap and easy to scratch. I wish I listened to other negative reviews and never bought this. It took less than 5 minutes to put together and it looks amazing. It's also much sturdier than I thought it would be. Looks great. Works as a great window table or behind a freestanding sofa or loveseat. Will buy another. It\u2019s much smaller and darker wood than expected. It\u2019s very lightweight and flimsy. Beautiful table. Pricey but well worth the splurge. The desk is great but was damaged in several places when we opened it. Too much hassle to return such a big item though. ", "This table arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It is HEAVY, but easy to assemble- two bolts for each leg and you are done. We love the clean, simple style. Good looking table. Sturdy. A few nicks on the veneer when we got it but still looks OK.  Probably just needs better packaging. Drawer is very small. As advertised Very reasonable price. Pretty good quality. I love mommy bench Such a nice table and looks just like the picture! Perfect for the decor I was going for! The only thing is that the drawer is not really big, but perfect for small paper or keys! I love this table!! Great looking table and very well made. Very easy to assemble and very minimalist but lovely. Nice quality, clean lines and durable. Sadly this was a big disappointment. Missing parts, impossible assembly, the list goes on. Also, I am quite sure we were given a returned piece. Returned the same day. Solid table. Fit our needs ", "Great table. The only problem is  the front of the drawer fell off and had to fix it. Looks really nice and very sturdy/heavy-duty.  I love it.  Only problem I have and it almost got knocked down to 3 stars is that the laminate on the front face is cracked/bubbly so it looks stupid. Awesome bench.  Legs can be installed in minutes.  Nice heavy quality and great price! This is a very solid, durable and attractive table.  Excellent for plants. Very nice ... just like the picture Came chipped, and I ordered two. Both had same problem. Threw away packaging so I can\u2019t return. Very disappointed. I' m very happy to select this table desk for my office. It's very fit the space & comfortable for my job. Great value, exactly as expected. I love it just wish it was a standing or bar height. Very disappointed in this product. Low quality vaneer, arrived very damaged. ", "good quality for the price! Beautiful and sturdy. Easy to put together. Love this purchase. Looks great. It is Strong and the design is very nice. Very upset. Table itself is great, but one of the legs is not only bent but is shorter than others. This table is amazing! Great quality, easy to assemble. Really nice table. Worth every penny \u2764\ufe0f Box arrived damaged and screws are missing. Very uneven surface. Sleek stylish look.  Good construction. Easy to assemble. Trendy table that looks more expensive than it was ", "I love this table! Beautiful in its simplicity as well as sturdy! Really cheap wood but expected for the price loved it The table come with scratch. Love the design and feel of it. Great quality wood and very easy to put together. My first order came damaged, but was able to return for a replacement. Beautiful engineering, better than expected! Easy to assemble. Easy to assemble. Modern look Love my table!! Came pretty chipped, not impressed. Great quality and easy to build ", "very cool, good quality for the price. Um....Rivet seems like a high brand in Amazon but things aren't really high-end. I mean... price is cheap, but table shouldn't have allergy reaction to water. It makes crazy looking bump with black spots when it gets wet. I wish I took pic. When it dries, spots goes away but bumps are still there. What a table! I won't deny this is a great table in its construction. Solid. Sturdy. Everything you'd want in a table.... But I bought it to fit over my Rennai propane heating unit in my apartment, as an entryway table. It would fit EXACTLY over it if the legs anchored on the sides instead of angling towards the center. It's hard to see in the picture how the legs attach and none of the dimensions mention the leg base on the underside of the table is significantly shorter than the leg base at the floor. In person, this item looks much \u201ccheaper\u201d than it does in the photos.  It\u2019s also significantly darker than I was expecting it to look. I just received this console table today and was so excited to put it together. Right away I noticed the defect in the laminent. I\u2019m so disappointed. I love the table otherwise. Very disappointed, now I have to try and return it. Such a hassle. I have quite a few vintage MCM pieces in my home. I love vintage, but I dislike antique store pricing so thank god for vintage inspired and reproduction furniture. When I saw the Rivet Industrial Hairpin Dining table with the hairpin legs I jumped out of my seat and had to get it. I have a lovely repro dining table but thought this would make a stylish desk for my studio. Rivet's line of products continue to impress and the Industrial Hairpin furniture is no exception.  At first I was not sure how sturdy the furniture would be by looking a the photos, as the legs looked small.  However, they are very sturdy and in person the products look much better in person. This is a rock solid dining table... at almost 6ft long, a nice size as well... This table was nice for awhile but within a month the material it\u2019s made from started rippling along the edges.  I thought I could live with it but two months later it got even worse. Large stain in middle of table and wood cracked on side. The table wasnt protected by much other than a very think piece of styrofoam. ", "This product is made very cheap. My first one arrived broken, however it's replacement arrived the next day. Very easily scratched and dented. It isn't worth buying. Very nice table ! Looks great. Scratches incredibly easily. Beware "]}}
