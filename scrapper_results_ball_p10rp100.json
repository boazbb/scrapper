This Eafengrow ef928 is a tank. Not too big I was worried it may have been. I like it alot. Nice smooth action, can be opened and closed one handed. She's definitely sexy. Hair popping sharp right of the box. Definitely getting quality and what a great price. I definitely will be purchasing more from Eafengrow in the future.\n \n  Wow, this knife is unbelievable for the price. Was skeptical about this brand but this one is a home run. Perfect blade centering and early lockup. I don't understand why that is so hard for benchmade, crkt, and boker to get right. \n  Unexpectedly large and heavy, but the same price as a regular knife. Very thick blade and mine came super sharp. The proportions of the blade make it look smallish in the photos, but it\u2019s just extra wide. The workmanship is very good, everything is properly aligned, the action is smooth, and the finishing is consistent. \n  Amazing Knife for the money. I can't believe how thick the d2 steel is! Smooth one handed opening and closing. Amazing G10 grip and it's the perfect size for my medium to large hands! Im amazed the quality and craftsmanship of this blade it's my new favorite EDC blade and honestly I like it better than some of my more expensive knives. Efangrow knocked it out of the park with this one.\n \n  This could easily cost 3-5 times the price. Fully tightened pivot and you can still flip it with solid lockup.

Thank you!\n \n  Have to test as per highly aclaim designer.\n \n  Off the tee the new TP5 is just an absolute monster. I easily picked up another 10 yards & my grouping was much tighter compared to the Pro V1. The ball is extremely forgiving off the tee and from anything more than 100 yards out.

The first generation of Pix didn\u2019t excite me because it looked like an after thought.  These balls are great!  The Pix on the ball are sleek and are a cool graphic, and the design for helping aim the ball is fantastic!  Being given a margin either side helps me with lining up the putt!  I bought 4 boxes, they are a little pricey, but definitely a great ball from my first impressions on the practice green. \n  Was on my way out the door to golf course today and these were sitting on my front porch. Perfect timing on the delivery. \n  I play TP5X white balls regularly for their spin controll, particularly the spin control in the wind.  I draw a putting line on all of my golf balls.  I have tried to hit other balls with \u201cpix\u201d designs, such as the soccer ball pattern look, and didnt like looking down at that. \n  Pros. \u2b07\ufe0f \n  Local store had none in stock so I turned to Amazon and boom.  Bending playing these for the second year and they are freaking amazing\n \n  I\u2019ve played Pro V1 and Pro V1x my entire life. I just recently switched to the TP5x and it is by far the best ball I\u2019ve ever played! Longer, straighter, less spin, higher trajectory. Durability is also top notch.\n \n  I like this ball as a year round ball.  My index is 6.3 and always liked the Pro V1x for summer use but not winter.  I prefer this ball year round to the Pro V\n \n  I like the pix golf ball, helps with alignment on putts and gives me a point on the ball to focus on with my other golf shots.  However, I ordered the TP5x and received the TP5 which has a different composition..\n \n  5stars. These balls have Zip!\n \n  Great balls.\n ", "\n  Great balls for low spin of the driver. The tpx lacks spin around the greens tho, for scoring go Tp5 or Bridgestone XS.\n \n  This is the best golf ball I have ever seen I make every putt and the alignment is amazing.And I even hole putts without the alignment\n \n  Gives you feed back on puts very well.  Great ball around the green.\n \n  great performing ball but the Taylor made print is curved making it off for putter alignment\n \n  I already play TP5x's as my main ball and have purchased and used 2-3 different pix designed balls and love all of them dearly. I generally play with a line on my ball to help align for putting and was excited that this would compete with Chromesoft's ERC Triple Track ball as the best pre-lined ball for putting but was disappointed. The line system is pretty exciting but after 2 rounds and several hours putting on my mat at home, I still couldn't get used to lining up the outside triangles to point at the target. \n  These TaylorMade TP5x pix are premium golf balls and designed with alignment assist as a key selling point.  There are clear markings on this ball to help with targeting drives and putts.  The theory is you make more putts and hit more shots on line with this system.  However, unless you are super patient, and have the willingness to continually bend over and line up your ball (and your playing partners are also patient) this could be overkill for the average golfer (like my 10-index husband).  On the other hand, this ball will be very attractive to any highly analytical player.  Regardless of the markings, this is a premium ball.\n \n  Played with these in a cold day in April.  The ball responded very well to the 45 degree temperature.  It did not mark easily and the flight was really nice.  The markings are interesting and really help to separate your ball from others, but that would be negated if more than one is used in the group.  I usually play Pro V1's, but in bad weather, Pro V's are not generally my ball to go to.  I will definitely use these in all weather conditions. \n  What I Like: \n  The TP5x pix 2.0 golf ball from TaylorMade is exceptional.  Great graphics allow for easier visibility.  Soft feel, very responsive off the tee.  High quality that will last, assuming you don't lose them like I do.  As far as I'm concerned these balls rank right up there with the best from Titleist and Callaway.  Highly recommended.\n \n  The arrow lines on these when they spin help to understand what the ball is doing based on your swing. ", "\n  I'm no pro golfer by any means, but I really liked these - they seem nice, hit as straight as any I've had before, and don't seem to scuff up quite as easy.\n \n  These balls are of excellent quality but a bit expensive, which is why I deducted a star.\n \n  I really love the clearpath design.  This has really improved my putting.\n \n  Jugu\u00e9 mucho tiempo con las ProV1x, luego cambi\u00e9 a las TP5 de Taylormade y mejor\u00e9 mucho. Ahora llevo 2 rondas con las TP5x Pix 2 y son excelentes.

These had great reviews so we have them a try. We have a lab who loves to destroy her toys and tears the pet store balls to shreds in minutes. We have all 3 of these spread throughout the house and they're all intact. Looks like she may have started to try pulling the fuzz on one but didn't. If she's bored enough I'm sure she'd tear them apart but the fact she hasn't yet is good enough for me.\n \n  I purchased these for my dog. I was very pleased with the price and the overall quality.\n \n  I needed 3 tennis balls. This can arrived complete with 3 tennis balls sealed inside. Upon opening the can I was able to verify that there were indeed 3. The balls act as expected when bounced on the ground with hit with a racquet. They are tennis ball green and that is also okay with me.\n \n  Great add on item. Needed tennis balls to dry my winter coats with after washing these worked great and we're great value.\n \n  Many dog balls that I tried and all of them broke within 5 mins but not this. That's when I knew the quality and cost were worth it! Never regret for buying this!\n \n  I don't play tennis but I am active so wanted a trigger point ball to use on those areas of my body that are tight and need some release. LaCrosse balls ,which are typically used, are too hard so prefer to use tennis balls. These tennis balls are firm yet will soften with usage. I use them to roll on the bottom of my feet for plantar fasciitis and around my shoulders to get at the rotator cuff muscles.\n \n  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She plays tennis and pretty sure she has used them to ace her serve.\n \n  Bought these for my dog. Good standard tennis balls.

These things lasted 6 months of constant use and I still have 2 balls left from the pack. A great buy!\n \n  My local Target didn't have these so I ordered them here. Nice and fresh and bouncy.

That's why dogs love 'em\n \n  One ball to hang in garage for parking my car.  The other two for my puppy.  Not a tennis player obviously.\n \n  Bought these for the dogs to play with. \n  Not a lot to rate on tennis balls but these have the US Open logo and they look good.\n \n  Great for what I needed them for ( to put under my Rv wiper blades)\n \n  I never notice any performance difference. But packaging is nice.\n ", "\n  Everything fine- no problems\n \n  Just what I wanted!\n \n  I bought these to use for in the dryer to help dry things quicker. I must say that it does really help.\n \n  They're tennis balls. \n  too expensive\n \n  Excellent seller, excellent product delivers what it promises\n \n  These are round and yellow and bouncy. And ODORLESS. Bought them to put in the dryer with a down jacket. Worked great. They've since been inherited by my dog. Magically taught him to fetch after we'd failed the last 3 years.\n \n  I am a 3.0 Club tennis player which means that I seek any advantage possible to help out my game.  I usually play with PENN balls as they are readily available but they have always felt \"flat\" to me after like 15-30 mins of play on a hard court.  I played a tournament that used these Wilson balls and they definitely kept their bounce throughout the 90 minute play and I felt like my serves had a little higher bounce to them.  I now buy these balls at my local \"red circle\" store.  They are $1.25 more than the Penn balls - I paid $3.25 but I feel like it is worth the extra cost.  I just wish I could find them in a case at my local warehouse store.  So, if you are a \"so so\" tennis player like me, these might give you a little more zip to your game. And if you are an amazing tennis player, it may add 1-5 mph on your serve.  Give it a try!\n \n  Photo shows 4 cans, description states it only includes 1 can. No reason for any photo that shows 4 cans.\n \n  I don't play tennis. These are for our 3 dogs to chase.

She has a good chomp on them without splitting and none of the \"furry stuff\" has been pulled off. Overall a brilliant make of tennis balls, I've already had two lots and will probably buy more, great price too!\n \n  Bought these for my dog as I\u2019m fed up of using cheap tennis balls that fall apart in his launcher, three balls in the tube and still using the first one months on. Excellent tough quality and bounce\n \n  For the product in which I revived I was pleased with what I got. The item arrived on time and no damage done to the packaging. For the price of around \u00a33 which I paid I would definitely say it was value for money. I don\u2019t have any dislikes on it due to the fact that the money that I bought I with could of got any more for value I would definitely buy again from here.\n \n  I bought these to relieve some back pain (in case anyone is confused check out all the YouTube videos on this one). These balls were better priced than some others. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be great for tennis too.\n ", "\n  I accept that the description says pack of 3,  but the photo clearly shows a tube of 4 balls\n \n  I have a tennis ball saver that holds 3 balls.  It makes sense for me to buy new balls in groups of 3.

I didn\u2019t expect them to be so small but that is my fault for not reading he desription well enough. Would have needed at least 3 bags (at $30 a pop!) to fill his pool. However, the reason for the 1 star review is that these are super flimsy! I paid the high price because of the \u201ccrush proof\u201d claim! My 3 year old is not a big kid and all he does is jump in, lay down and then get out. It has not even been 2 weeks and we have already bad to throw away 21 balls because they were smashed! He just played in it again this morning and, as you can see, there are probably a dozen or more that are crushed! Waste of money! Wish I could return them!\n \n  Not 200 balls. Want my $$$back or more balls. Supposed to be 200 balls. I just counted I have a little over a 100 balls. Total rip off for 30$.  Nor Happy.\n \n  When I first started looking for plastic balls to put in a pop up tent my kids got, I was shocked to see the Click N' Play Pack of 200 balls was so expensive.  I actually bi-passed these for a while because of the price.  After doing my research and reading a million reviews, I did settle on the Click N Play balls, it had the best reviews.  After I received the balls I knew why.  These balls are extremely sturdy without being hard.  My two year has yet to smash or squish a ball even when running and jumping into the balls.  Some people think the balls are too small but they are big enough that my two year old can grip them in his hands so I'm happy with the size.  The colors are deep colors and the balls don't have that cheap feel to them that so many other play pit balls do.  I am only giving 5 stars, because even though they are excellent and not cheaply made, I still think the price was a bit high.\n \n  We purchased 400 of these balls to put into a wading pool (48in x 10in) for our toddler. He loves it! They are almost exactly as described. Very heavy-duty. He hasn't been able to crush or dent any of them. The description lists 5 colors but had 6 = yellow, red, orange, pink, blue, and green. I didn't count them but they seem to all be there in equal amounts. Though I will say that the orange and red are kind of similar...more like light orange and dark orange to my eyes. Other reviews mention the size was smaller than they expected. Well, the description says 2.5 inches and that is the correct size (see photo.) So if you are looking for something larger, don't order these. Overall, very happy with this purchase.\n \n  Fills 1 layer deep of a 45\" blowup pool perfectly. Great colors. Good variety. Ball material seems thinner than I expected but they have air sealed in them so you can't really crush them which is perfect. You can squeeze them slightly but overall great and fits our purpose.\n \n  The balls did the job helped fill up my niece's ball pit a bit. The one to the right is the one you will get out of this. The one to the left is just a bigger version just showing size. Take note the ball pit is mixed with bigger ones and more than 200 small ones ,only the small ones you see are what you get in the 200 ball set.\n \n  These just arrived the other day so my review is based off first impressions.  I ordered these for my 6mo who is just learning to sit unassisted.  Ordered the pack of 200 to put in his pack n play which seems to be the perfect amount to completely fill the bottom with a little volume to spare.  Seem to be of good quality & the color variation is really fun.  I'm sure with time my son will be just as excited about his ball pit as I am!\n \n  We've had a set of these for nearly a year now, and they've held up so well I'm buying more.  We use these for our son's ball pit, and we had two other brands of balls in there as well, and I try to grow the amount of balls as he grows. \n  This is a perfect size ball for my 9 mo son. He fell in love with it instantly! He can hold it with his little hands and it's light and soft. I also bought a ball pit tent to pair with. Having 200 balls was perfect for this particular tent. I mean, 400 balls will probably look fuller, but not necessary at all for this little guy. In terms of washing, I put them in multiple laundry bags and threw them in a washer. Then dried it in a dryer on air dry mode. I thought about washing them in a tub with dish soap/laundry detergent but washing machine was so much easier. \n  I was completely dissatisfied. The balls are small and looks more like 50 balls.. I was tempted to count them.. Smh not worth 30 bucks!!\n ", "\n  My little guys has a ball with these. He's only 10 months but gets a kick when we put these out. We got a cheap inflatable pool and occasionally we put these in the pool indoors and let him have fun playing (well chewing on the balls really). We'll hide some of his toys inside too and he loves to find them. For a 10 month old, it won't entertain them long but lots of smiles and laughs for a little. Plus, there are so many other creative projects you can do with these as the baby gets older. Look on pintrest. You'll find things like using a cardboard box to make color sorters to drop the balls into, etc. Good product to invest in. Also, the balls were smooth for baby to chew on. Clean and didn't smell like plastic. Came with mesh bag to store.\n \n  I bought these balls over 16 months ago and they are still in tact. I have a now 2 year old and hes stepped on then, bit them when he was younger and now and they have never broken or got damaged. \n  So I ordered a set of 200 and these were great! I ordered another set of 200 a few days later, as I realized I needed more for the ball pit I purchased. This next set came and as I dumped them in realized about half this bag was crushed and flimsy already!!! It was like they were way thinner than the first set and half the balls had half the amount of air in them others did. The difference in quality of the 2 purchases was crazy. I\u2019m so upset and disappointed, as this is for my little girl\u2019s first birthday.\n \n  only 85 balls\n \n  I'm really upset because my order only came with 180 balls and I ordered the 200. I recounted 3 times and had my husband count and yes there was only 180. I like the balls I got just wish I had gotten what I paid for. Idk hwo to get ahold of anyone...I just want the rest of my order I paid for\n \n  The description says these are crush proof, but they are not. The plastic is very flimsy and thin and very easily crushed. I won't be buying these again.\n \n  Out order for my soon 200 balls but today I just counted in pack only 100 balls. I am late to return this. I am not happy with that.\n \n  My review of these balls is not about the balls themselves which are great but it\u2019s a complaint to Amazon that you OVERPACKAGED this so much!  The balls already came in a mesh bag that honestly was all I would have wanted.  Then, after the mesh bag, there was a box from the maker, then Amazon really upsets me by putting that box, which is super thick and already super strong , into one of their HUGE boxes that is double in size than the previous box!  I am horrified with Amazon for constantly and especially in this instance, blatantly abusing the environment by overpackaging time and time again!  Please Amazon please stop this abuse of cardboard!!! I wish there was an option to have very little to no packaging with Amazon\n \n  There were no 200 balls inside but somewhere around ~130 as we counted.\n \n  so they fill 45\" pool with some gaps.  I am thinking about getting another 200 balls. ", "\n  Ordered these for the my granddaughter's ball pit.  They are the perfect size and filled her pit well.  They are also good quality!  The day they came in I was at work.  When I got home, balls were scattered all over the yard.  My black lab thought Christmas had come early!  He was having an excellent time.  I just knew they would be ruined and chewed up.  However, I gathered all 201 balls (there was an extra) and examined all of them.  Not a single one was crushed or punctured!  He did rip the net bag they were in but I just bought a mesh laundry bag & put them in it.  Would buy again with instructions for the delivery man to put them in a safer spot!  lol\n \n  My granddaughter turned 1 on 03 04 2018 As soon as she saww the balls in mesh bag she tried to pick it up .The balls  have No Smell at all  it was very important to me They are small the perfect size for a baby that can at least sit and move It seemed she went to pick up dark blue balls .As we know babies with always go for a darker color first ..200 balls I brought to go in the Ecosun ball pit /tunnel/ taller house at the other end she could stand  in or come out .I did alot of research on all brands of balls .I wish I could of got a 400.pack only because I wanted the ball pit area filled up .200 is really enough tho .I highly recommend these type size plus if you want to store mesh bad comes with and is made well. They were a bit more expensive than others.that's another reason i knew they were well over 5*s\n None None None \n  \u00a0As many reviews said about count but I ordered for 200 and got exactly 200 colored balls. \n  Just buy the bag of 400 for only $15 more.  We got a ball pit and a bag of 200 balls assuming it would be way bigger balls. These balls are very tiny, and we even wanted to count them because they were so little.  As you can see in pic, had we known that we woyld actually need way more than 200 to even fill a tiny little bucket, then we would have gotten the 400 bag and not 200.  Just not happy and they could at least put a notice that to fill or have enough to even play with, please purchase at least 4 bags haha so now we will buy yet another bag, but this time the 400 ball set\n \n  I purchased this Click N' Play Pack of balls to use for indoor physical activity for two year old grandson.  I was pleased with the quality and colors of the balls. Two hundred balls sound like a lot, but in actuality, they only partially covered a small hard plastic wading pool.  I felt they were too pricey to purchase another pack.  He enjoyed tossing them around the room, but wasn't interested in rolling around on them.  I discovered a better location for them was underneath a climber we had gotten him.  The area intended for sand was a good size and better location for the balls.  All in all,  it's a purchase we could have done without.  I just wish I hadn't spent that much money for them in the first place!\n \n  So we recently got a used bounce house from some friends for our three year old twin boys.  I've purchased plastic balls in the past for them but they didn't last long.  Got these this week and was very impressed by house much more sturdy they are compared to the other three brands I've gotten in the past.  Light and soft enough that they won't hurt anyone yet sturdy enough that my twins won't destroy them within a couple of days.\n \n  6/2019:  Apparently I've purchased these before but it has been a few years since I did this review so I'm adding additional feedback to my original review! \n  We purchased these as a supplement for a ball pit attached to a bouncy house for our little ones. The ball pit definitely needed extra balls! But we were surprised by how little 200 balls really is. The bag really wasn't that big, and the balls came just short of covering the ball pit floor with a single layer. For what it is, the price seemed pretty steep... should get twice the amount of balls for that? But other than that we have no complaints! The balls are big and colorful, and durable.\n \n  Not very durable. China made. shipped very fast. For the price not bad. My dog was in love with them in our ball pit but I have 3 stars because even with small baby teeth she destroyed them. Thought they were more firm. I\u2019m sure all the kiddos will be fine with these. My baby has fur and teeth. I\u2019ll buy more durable ones later.\n \n  My toddler received as a gift a small pit with 200 balls and she loves it. Problem being 200 balls is just not enough. Had to order 200 more for good \"coverage\", pun intended. I will probably buy more when my other kid is old enough to get into the pit. ", "\n  Filled a pool for a ball pit.  Not expensive... I was expecting cheap plastic at the price, but they seem pretty sturdy. \n  Really liking these! The balls were dumped into a playpen that my one year doesn't really use anymore and she loves sitting in there kicking them around. The balls are just smaller than a baseball or lacrosse ball, but are super light. I dont have any fear of her chucking one of these balls through a window or tv. They seem pretty sturdy, too. The one that the dog got a hold of for a few moments didnt get punctured or collapse before we could get it away from her. \n  Your toddlers will lick and bite these. Then they get thrown everywhere for you to clean up. You'll find them in the ball pit, the corner, under the couch...anywhere where there is space big enough to fit the balls. \n  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!! \n  I bought these for my 2 year old niece when i purchased a small ball pit. These are really great and non-toxic. My brother and his wife never have to worry about her licking or trying to chew on them. \n  I got this for my one year old nephew for Christmas with one of the ball pits on amazon as well. I would recommend buying more than 200 balls. It really just makes one single layer in the pit. He was loving it but he will also be sharing this with his 2 year old brother so more balls in the pit will be much more entertaining for them. These are really lightweight too so I\u2019m not worried about either kid getting injured when they throw them at each other. I love the mesh zip up bag the balls come in too. Easy storage!\n \n  The balls are great! Soft, super colorful and not able to hurt a human face when hurled from 2 feet away by a 3 year old. Just what I was looking for! No weird smells, easy to wipe clean. \n  I bought the 200 and they fill my small doggie pen nicely. \n  I ordered the 2.5 inch but it turned out to be 2.3\" so just be caution. The ball quality and color is good but 2.3\" does not match the rest of my balls I owned so I returned it.\n \n  We've had these balls for a year now, and not a single one has crushed. I'm impressed. I'm a very obese person, and if I put all my weight on just one, it hurts, but it doesn't crush. I've been very surprised. Other reviewers say that they've had some balls crush, and I don't understand why. Our ball pit is in the basement where it's usually 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit, and my boys play in the ball pit every day.\n ", "\n  Update:  Don't make the same mistake I made.  I bought two packs of these.  Click N' Play offers a 400 value pack for $50 ... so instead of paying $60 for two ... you will save $10 and pay $50 for the 400.  I didn't know when I ordered. None None None \n  \u00a0I haven't bought any other brand of balls but this seemed to be the exact thing I was looking for. I had originally bought the 200 pack and after placing them in our playpen it looked like it wasn't enough so I bought another 200 pack which seem to do the job. My baby loves swimming in it and has a blast. The balls are soft and won't hurt your baby if they fall on them. You can help teach your kids identify colors and count if you want to be creative by placing them out in front of you kid. I would repurchase \n  I was so pleased to open the box to find another box which held the mesh bag of brightly colored balls. Very well packed! These balls are pretty sturdy and should last for awhile. And yes, all 200 balls were in the bag.\n \n  We bought these to replace the balls that came with our LO's ball pit. The original ones would break and tear constantly and by the time these arrived there were only 20 or so left. These balls, however, have been fantastic. They have some give to them, but are very sturdy. They have been chewed on, sat on, fallen on, and tripped over, but not a single one has broken. They were a bit smaller than anticipated, but they are the perfect size for little toddler hands.\n \n  They appear to be durable yet very safe and the amount of give (if you squish it) appears to be just right. I am using them to fill the bottom of a large plant container (for drainage and for needing less soil - which is heavy). Works well for that and my grandkids love playing with them (the ones I didn't need) even though we don't have them in one of those ball pits.\n None None None \n  \u00a0I thought 200 was going to fill up this dome at least halfway but it didn't. These balls are pretty soft but is sturdy enough for my child (16lb). The ball will indent in if you press on it but inflates out again. I put my weight (112lb) on one and it did the same thing.\n \n  We bought our grandson a play house with a tunnel to a ball pit. These balls were perfect. They are brightly colored with a glossy sheen that allows them to move easily when our grandson splashes around in them. They hold their shape even when our grown children climb in to play along. A word of caution, you will need more balls than you think. We originally bought 400 but they barely made a dent. My husband bought another pack of 1000 and now everyone is happy.\n \n  What is it about a ball pit, even if it's a small one?!?!  Grands loved having these balls in the tents/tunnels I bought them. One tent was for the balls, other tents were for cooking or camping or for toys. Balls can go anywhere, so at least one or two were carried with them when we went out, couple were out in the sandbox.  Balls are soft/pliable, not the harder/brittle plastic.\n \n  Balls are little bit smaller than I thought, but still perfect for little hands! Love the colors. They are crush proof so even with my daughter biting them or stepping on them, they haven\u2019t crushed. 200 is enough to fill the bottom of a standard pit but not enough to be a pool of balls. For my two year old, its perfect! Love the mesh bag it comes in so I have the option to store it or take it with me.\n \n  These are perfect for toddlers, especially if they like to face dive into everything! These are durable yet soft enough not to hurt child or damage the ball. Light weight and easy for toddler to throw. A little pricey for ball pit balls, but can appreciate the non toxic etc. materials. Variety of colors are inviting!\n ", "\n  I bought these for my 2 year old to go in a blow up pool or bouncyhouse. The balls are great, they are somewhat soft but haven't bent in or deformed even after being stepped on. I wouldn't recommend them for a group of 2 year olds in a bouncy house as they have a hard enough time just jumping around normally. My kid got tripped up on them several times, so I just packed them all up to save until he is a little older. They did well with a lot of them in the blow up pool, however. \n  I got these to use in a little indoor trampoline for my toddler and they have been great. They are smaller than I expected, but have been the perfect size for her little hands to pick up. Not one has dented or broken, even with her and her older cousins playing and jumping with them. I knocked off one star just because I feel like $25 is a little steep, but 200 balls was the perfect amount to fit in the 46 inch trampoline.\n \n  Super excited for my daughter to be able to play in her very own ball pit! Yes... the balls are a little smaller than what you typically see in ball pits but they are the perfect size for her hands to grab around. All of the bright colors of the balls make it a great opportunity for learning her colors as well. And bonus is the sturdy mesh net bag with zip closure for easy storage! Highly recommend!\n \n  Thought it was a great idea. Unfortunately my son wasn\u2019t really impressed (2).  However my older children (12,13,18) had the most fun in the pit, and throwing the balls around my home in pit ball tag. I also, at the time of purchase forgot that I would have to constantly be cleaning these things up! Won\u2019t buy again, maybe for someone else\u2019s kid to drive them nuts!\n \n  We bought these to use in our bouncy house. I chose these because they say crush free however, they crushed pretty easy. Overall, decent amount of very colorful balls, smaller than I expected, probably would\u2019ve been just as much fun without these. I found throughout the day we were tossing them out as they were crushed. We had four small toddlers in a very large bounce house so wouldn\u2019t have expected this.\n \n  Gave it a 4 only because the balls are so tiny compared to regular balls at like.... Chucky Cheese. They do fit in my one year old sons hand perfectly though. Buy two bags of you want to fill up a tent to cover the bottom. I bout another bag of 200, the larger ones, so now I have a nice mix and my son loves it!!!!\n \n  These are some seriously strong balls. Our old play-pen balls would easily get squashed when one of our heavier infants would step on them. These new balls have stood numerous direct blows from the feet of our lil' monster with no lasting issues. \n  I got these to make a ball pit for my 16 month old grandson. He loved playing with them. I love them because they are soft enough that he can sit on them without hurting his legs and the spring back.  To clean them I dumped them in the tub and returned them to the mesh storage bag, clean and ready for his next visit.\n \n  These balls are very sturdy. I was remembered the balls that use to be in ball pits at fast food play places were very crushed fairly easily and was afraid these would be like that as well, but I was happy to find out they were not. They easily withstood the rough play that a 1.5 and 2.5 year old threw at them and never showed a dent.\n \n  I bought these to use in a small ball pit for my 1 year old twins and they absolutely love them. Months later they still play with them all the time both in and out of the pit. Do keep in mind that 200 is a lot of balls if you are not putting them in a deep pit. I find them everywhere lol but they are great and well worth the small headache in finding them in weird random places around the house.\n ", "\n  Initially I bought the 400 pack for my son's ball pit, but we found it only filled it up about 1/3 of the way. We got the 200 pack which filled up the ball pit to just over halfway. We decided we'll be buying one more 200 pack to get the level of balls we want. I usually put the balls in the tub to clean them. We use one giant bag to hold all the balls together.\n \n  They're not too bad for the price. They're not all that durable and crush pretty easily but when they're fairly inexpensive to replace...It's not that big of a deal. Especially when you need a ton of them to fill whatever playset you need them for. \n  I had purchased these with intentions that they would be exactly 2 1/2 inches.  When I purchased (Dec 2014) my grandson's Imagination Generation Pop Up Ball Pit Tent with 200 Ball Pit Balls & Carrying Case, the balls are exactly 2.5\" in diameter (RED ball).  Upon ordering more pit balls since...they are all 2 1/4 inches.  They don't match the ones we already have.  Latest order are these Click N' Play balls (BLUE ball) and measure 2 1/4 inches.  Would have given 1 star but they shipped quickly and still the soft pit balls.\n \n  We bought 200 balls for our 4ft ball pit, we originally had 50. 200 was still enough for this ball pit but it did the job of providing fun for my LO. No odor upon arrival, we were able to use them immediately after a wash.\n \n  I did just receive these today, but I'm already extra happy with them. It's hard to find these for some where that isn't ridiculously priced and since these were the cheapest I was concerned the quality would reflect that. The quality of these is awesome. My three year old and one year old have been playing with them in the ball pit I bought for them since it was opened a couple hours ago.\n \n  These are plastic little balls. If you step on them they're crushed easy.  My dogs are scared of them in the ball pit, but will snag one or two to shred and then take a nap.  Idk what more you could want for your ballpit.  They're cheap too.  Good case.  Wish it was more of a drawstring bag though.\n \n  We bought these balls for when the grandchildren came for Christmas.  There were enough balls to cover the bottom of a 'tent' well - I wouldn't have wanted any less, but any more and I'd still be picking the up a week after they left!  (they liked throwing them out!)  I like the fact that they came in their own net bag - when the kids were gone, I just put them all away until next time.  The balls were the perfect size for a ball tent - I wasn't sure which size to get, but this was the one!\n \n  Uhh..i only got 100..not the 200 like described. We got a box saying \"part 1 of 2\" and 1 bag with 100 balls. .....Amazon is usually good with fixing these issues... though we did expect a few packages. Maybe half got lost?\n \n  Bought this for my child, and it was a great success! Only down side is that it sounds like a lot of balls, but it isn't. I can fill a large laundry basket with my child it it. So if you're looking to fill up a small blow up kid pool or playpen, buy a couple of these at least. Overall worth the countless hours of fun with these, but wish they be a little cheaper for the amount. They are light and semi flexible, yet sturdy.\n \n  I really appreciate that these balls were clean and had no odor whatsoever. I thought they might smell like manufacturing chemicals, but they did not AT ALL. There are some thin spots on most of the balls, but my daughter has tried to chew on them and none of them have punctured so I am happy with this purchase!\n ", "\n  Durable! \n  I almost went with a different set as $30 seemed pricey for plastic balls but after reading reviews decided to go with these. They do seem to be a good quality though, we've had them for a few weeks now. When they first arrived I  thought it didnt look like 200 balls but I counted and they are all there. They are also smaller in size than I thought they would be but they're really quite perfect for toddlers. My daughter loves them!\n \n  So really, if you are buying these for one of them ballpits, you're going to need another. The balls are large enough, but you'll only get one layer of coverage, and if you're the kind of lunatic that goes at life head first, that ain't enough. No sir, go ahead and grab another bag of these awesome balls and toss em in that pit, dive in, boom, get some!!\n \n  I bought these for my one yr olds play tent and he loves them! I was worried when I read that they were a bit smaller but I actually kind of like it because theyre easier for him to hold. They seem like I can squish them fairly easy but my son cant so Im not worried about that. Because of reviews I made sure to count all my balls and I wasnt missing any so that was a relief!!\n \n  Really impressed with this product. Great quality, well made and holds up great over time. These are smaller than the common balls used for ball pits, but I actually prefer the smaller size. I got them when my son was 6 months old and he was able to pick them up and hold them. Now at 9 months they are still the perfect size and they have held up great. Not one of them has been crushed (despite being stepped on) and he still loves playing with them. Really glad we decided to get these. We got the 200 count and that was fine for us, but I would reccomend getting 400 if you are wanting more of a true \"bal pit\" experience.\n \n  what you think you see is not enough. maybe for a less than 1 year old but a play hard go getter will need at least 400. I got the princess house for Grand daughter and only 200, I immediately ordered another 200. the balls are good for small children not meant for heavy duty teens. if your games minded these could be used for games. \n  I previously wrote a comment and I believe it was deleted but please don\u2019t waste your money. The balls took forever to come in although it is marked prime. When the balls finally arrived, they are NOT crush proof. A complete waste of time and I am highly disappointed!\n \n  We only received 161 balls. I'm not even sure how 200 could fit in the mesh bag, because there wasn't much room left in ours. Of the 161 about 10 have rough/sharp edges and are unusable. \n  Just as expected since I\"ve ordered these before.  Last time I got them we noticed the baby getting a rash around his mouth.  This time, I dumped them all in the bathtub with a little soap and no rash!!!!  :)\n \n  I ordered the Click N' Play 200 pack of balls to use with the Intex Rainbow Ring Inflatable Play Center (\u00a0\n Intex Rainbow Ring Inflatable Play Center, 117\" X 76\" X 53\", for Ages 2+ \n  \u00a0) I recently purchased for my 2 year old son. I am very happy with the product. The project arrived in 2 days, and the colors were very bright and vibrant, just like they were pictured. The mesh bag the balls came is is easy to zip and un-zip, and keeps the balls together nicely when not in use. If you are you looking for nice, bright, fun, balls for a reasonable price to use with your kiddie pool, inflatable house, or pack 'n play, I highly recommend these.\n ", "\n  These are very sturdy balls that I bought to go along with a play pit for my granddaughter. She got it for her 1st birthday and there were kids age 1 -8 in the ball pit and not one of these balls crushed. That was in October and these balls are still going strong. Very high quality and worth the difference in price compared to cheaper versions.\n \n  Sturdy, consistent quality, bright colors, and ball size for small hands to grasp are good.  Some people had mentioned slightly rough edging along a few seams.  I noticed very little, but went over the edges on about 10 balls with a vegetable peeler which made them quite smooth.  I also threw all the balls in the washing machine on delicate to wash them before use.  That worked great for easy cleaning.\n \n  By two of these if your filling a child\u2019s ball pit. Nice product that does not perm crush they are better than others as they have a pinhole in them that allows them to reinflate if smooshed/ crushed. My children and puppies have put them through a lot and they have heartily survived. Don\u2019t waste your time and money on inferior balls. I learned that lesson the hard way. Click n play balls are durable and as an added bonus come in a zippered pouch that can be used for as a sock underwear bag to keep your machine from eating small items.\n None None None \n  \u00a0We bought these balls paired with a small dog pool and the dogs love it. I can\u2019t complain. Although one of my older pups crushed a ball I do know that these aren\u2019t really meant for dogs. But hey they have a ball in the balls lol..\n \n  Balls are very resilient to pressure but are not hard. They maintain a \"soft\" quality about them. We also ordered the 400 set of these, and I recommend that amount over the 200. It's amazing how little they cover despite being 200 strong. They seem to be slightly smaller than the balls you see in fast food play areas, but maybe that's just because I have gotten a lot bigger and do not correctly recall. \n  Got these to go inside the\u00a0\n Kiddey\u2122 Ball Pit Play Tent for Kids - 6-sided Playhouse for Children - Fill with Plastic Balls or Use As an Indoor or Outdoor Tent (Balls Sold Separately) By Kiddey\u2122 \n  \u00a0and although the tent was a little disappointing the balls were great. They got a couple of solid hours of rough housing by a group of kids one to ten years old and all held up well. I could find any that were crushed or dented while I was collecting them from every corner of the room. If only the picked up themselves... \n  Fills my little mushroom tent perfectly. Good quality for the price. When my 23 pound son sits on them they don't collapse and stay that way. Seems like they're easy to clean and a good overall size. When they wear out I will be buying this exact same product again. The picture shows 1 bag of these balls.\n \n  I'm not sure what the going rate is for these type of plastic balls, but I was not expecting them to be so expensive. However, they are good quality and exactly what we were looking for - just like a kids play pen at an amusement park, but maybe even better quality.\n \n  Bought this for my 7 month old daughter, she doesn\u2019t care for it much but hopefully she\u2019ll get used to. They\u2019re the perfect size for her small hands to hold. Love the storage bag it comes with. Great vibrant colors. Also the perfect amount to fill my graco pack n play, gives it a good layers of balls and then some.\n \n  So far baby loves it. The 200 balls just about cover the floor of Graco playpen. Colors are nice and vibrant, will see how durable/lasting they are but baby might lose interest and be past ball pit stage before I find out! Will try using in tub, I'm sure it will be a hit!\n ", "\n  I bought this weeks ago for a ball pit and all 200 balls have survived my nearly 2 year old son. Even my husband and I have crawled over them and still no damage. I also used them to help my son learn colors and now he's an expert with all the colors in this pack!\n \n  These are not as strong as expected and they also don't fit ball poppers but will work for a ball pit. I contacted the company who never messaged me back. The return window is closed as we bought this to use for the 4th of July and my son's Birthday.\n \n  I ordered these for a blow up pool for our 1 year old. They are colorful and sturdy. I thought 200 would surely do the trick, but the pool is larger that I thought and I'll probably order another 200 of these ball to really fill it in well. My recommendation is to order more than you expected if you want good \"roll around\" coverage for your kiddo.\n \n  Glad I purchased these. They are just right for my grandson. Big enough where it can\u2019t be swallowed by any kid. Very colorful and durable. When my grandson is done playing with them I am able to wash them. My grandson is 6 months and he loves them.\n \n  Come in a variety of colors.  There are a lot of them.  They are extremely thin/flimsy.  They are easily squished.  Not as solid as other balls, and of course, useless once squished.  I have had to throw away many because they were stepped on or squished ny a toy.  Not a very good value for the money.\n \n  These are fun balls to play with.  My kids enjoy playing with them on the tramp or in a big box that we have.  After awhile they get squished and you have to throw them away.  However there are so many it doesn't matter too much.  We've had them for almost a year and we still have most of them and they get played with quite a bit.\n \n  These are cheap, not durable or crush free. False advertising! They do not withstand 90lbs, within minutes majority of the balls were crushed under my puppy\u2019s body weight, who\u2019s 40 lbs. Great colors but so expensive for the quality! I do Not recommend buying this. I wish I could get my money back.\n \n  These are balls are great. I have a 3 year old and 1 year old. I put the balls in a blow up pool and they had so much fun. We are going to use them at their upcoming birthday party. So far they prove to be crush proof as listed. We have two dogs that have destroyed a similar product by biting them and denting them. We will definitely need at least one more bag to fill up the pool more.\n \n  Have had these for a while now and they are super durable haven\u2019t had any crush and these have been tested by all sizes and they are still going strong. I keep these inside so they have not faded, they are just as vibrant as when we bought them\n \n  These balls are awesome! I bought two bags and put them in a tent for a ball pit. They are made of a flexible plastic that is light but also super durable. When my kid crushed one in his hand (took all his might) I thought that was it,  I'd have to return them.  But it sprang back into place within seconds.\n ", "\n  I have purchased other brands of balls for ball pits and always, I was disappointed. This product is amazing! No matter how much my toddler jumps, chews, throws and lays on them they keep their shape. I have even sat in the ball pit on them and they kept their shape. They are a little smaller than normal ball pit balls so I would say purchase quite a few!\n \n  Balls are great quality. They are a bit harder but isnt easily to flatten . Shiny and good size for toddler and babies to hold on hands . I should buy the bigger pack . 200 was not enough. i really like it!! doesnt get damaged easily. been a year now and still good and shiny! just wish they were cheaper. 29$ for 200 balls is quit expensive when it doesnt feel alot in a small pit\n \n  Not 200 pieces, it\u2019s more like 100\n \n  I just gave that as a gift to my grandson and now it's too late to return it, insufficient number of balls. Would have liked to been compensated for what were missing.\n \n  Ordered the pack of 200 for a ball pit for my dog. Not even biting them and just stepping on them they are crushing. Think that\u2019s bad? The bag only had 147 balls in it. Uhhhh... what? After we knew he liked them, I ordered 400 more as 200 (ish) didn\u2019t really fill his tiny dog pool. Not looking forward to counting those tomorrow.\n \n  They are not at all crush-proof. They were damaged within the first few minutes of use.\n \n  Used them with a pop-up castle that has a ball pit and the balls do not come with.  They are quite soft for a plastic ball. A bit smaller than i expected. They were a big hit at the birthday party. I would buy these again.\n \n  These are great!! Only problem we encountered was we would have needed 3 bags total to adequately fill up the ball pit. And it\u2019s a small one! It fits in my sons old bedroom which is now out 2yr old grandsons playroom. Just beep thatcin mins when purchasing. But they\u2019re sturdy, don\u2019t dent or smash & our grandson is all boy and very rough.\n \n  I got exactly what i ordered! Just be aware that this pack of 200 balls is no where near enough to fill a ball pit. This didn't even cover the bottom of the ball pit. If you want to fill a ball pit, you will need AT LEAST 1,000 balls. I need to order about 4 more of these to fill my grandson's ball pit a little more than halfway. I ordered the 'Kuuqa Kids Ball Pit Ball Tent Toddler Ball Pit'.\n \n  These are great, just what I wanted, fairly sturdy. HOWEVER, when I opened the top of the box with a box cutter, I slit the mesh bag the bells were to be stored in. The packing box was small enough there was no buffer between the contents and the lid. I\u2019m pretty unhappy the mesh bag is not useable and I have to store the balls in a trash bag. Be forewarned to carefully unbox!\n ", "\n  Had purchased a ball pit for my son and grandson to play in during our time we had to stay inside. The ball pit came with 20 balls which did not fill it up completely so I ordered these and they were perfect and colorful\n \n  Best bang for your buck, who knew that these balls were so expensive honestly, we use them as a ball pit for our dog and he has no issue with getting them chewed but he loves them so overall I am happy with the purchase\n \n  Definitely not 200 balls, should be sued for false advertising. \n  These are not crush proof. Not that expected them to be 100% crush proof but when I received mine nearly half were dented in. Big tip - if you order these make sure to not order anything else at the same time so they ship in their own box. Amazon put them in an oversized box with another, heavier, product and the end result is frustrating. I'm giving 3 stars because the product seems pretty decent but for the price they definitely could have been a bit sturdier and the shipping was awful.\n \n  So these balls are great cause even my 175lb husband sits on them and they don\u2019t crush.  I only gave 4 stars cause I expected them to be \u201ccommercial\u201d ball out size but there actually much smaller. If you see the third photo with them in the six sided tent that\u2019s definitely at least 400 or more balls. We counted there\u2019s 200 but they don\u2019t even cover the surface area of the floor in that tent.  When my son gets a bit older I will buy more so he can jump into them.\n \n  My 1 year old grandson loves these.  He sits in the middle of a pile of them, throws them, tries to eat them (but can't, cause they're too big.) chases them across the floor, and laughs. \n  200 balls is a lot less than one would think! I ordered these to put into a tent for my 14 month old to serve as a ball pit. They are of good quality and don\u2019t seem flimsy at all. They are brightly colored. They have no scent. \n  Best great-aunt ever! Out of all the gifts I bought for different kids including my own this was the best! I emptied them into a very large box and wrapped that box. He\u2019s two, unwrapped the box, he got in and did not get out until his parents were ready to leave. Happy and entertained 2year old on Christmas Eve. I\u2019m aunt of the year! Thank you!\n \n  Super soft plastic balls, easy to squeeze them, they are 175 balls not 200 balls as the description. Price is high for the low quality but it is ok for my baby swimming pool. Only disappointed for the quantities.\n \n  These are perfect for my daughter. We used an inflatable pool (which is listed as 34\", but I did not measure it) and 200 balls filled it perfectly. My 30\" tall one year old loves diving in, thrashing around, throwing balls out, and even putting the balls back. They are the perfect size for her hands and too big to fit in her mouth. Super happy with this purchase.\n ", "None None None \n  \u00a0He loves them,  but I don't believe I received 200. The nest is a bit empty and over time the balls do crumble.\n \n  My toddlers have catapulted themselves onto these balls from every possible angle and not a one has even so much as dented. I am super impressed with these balls. Now if only they had a self-cleaning option for when they\u2019re all over my living room...\n \n  Bought two bags and after a couple weeks of hard toddler play not a single one has crushed. Two bags feels sufficient for a kiddie pool, three would fit well as well. Really like the mesh bags. They'll come in handy when the balls need to be washed.\n \n  Bought these for my grandchildren for a ball pit and the loved it however my dog loved the balls also and would but the balls it wasn't hard to do they would go that very easily. They had a blast in the ball pit\n \n  I pour these into a small plastic pool with or without water. Its my grand daughter's favorite thing to do. She takes the balls out and puts them back and repeats. When she comes over, she looks for the balls.\n \n  My granddaughter loves these just as I expected to get They were great light weight so they can\u2019t injure anybody else when they get thrown or your pet easy cleanup easy to move to a different area I give them a 10\n \n  Purchased these balls for my son\u2019s sensory room ball pit. It only came with 161 balls. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Please send me the rest of the balls that I paid for! \n  Great addition to the bouncy castle. Soft but crush proof. Some sort of miracle of engineering. Soft enough that getting hit in the face by one doesn\u2019t really hurt, even if your child has an arm like Nolan Ryan.\n \n  Bought these for the playhouse tent. We have a 20 month old and 3 year old grand babies. They seem to hold up well and return to shape easily after being sat on. Just wish they would have been Westie proof. sigh Our Westies love balls and is dog heaven when he sneaks into the tent.\n \n  Plastic is very thin and feels cheap. Had the wash all the balls with bleach and soap as they had a greasy oily covering on all the balls. Overpriced. I saw deals for twice as many balls for only a few dollars more.\n ", "\n  I love these! I bought these as part of a gift for my daughter. They are a bit smaller than the ones you usually see in ball pits at fast food places but that's OK they are brightly colored and you can not crush them. My daughter loves to play with them. they all easily fit back into the bag for convenient storage. if you want a fun gift for your little one or to give as a gift these would be perfect and they are reasonably priced.\n \n  We have loved adding these to our daughters play over the summer. We use them in our bounce house, pool, and around the house. When my daughter was bouncing with them in the bounce house, we repeatedly found no damage to the balls after stepping or jumping on them. No balls have been squished or flattened even after multiple uses. They are thin enough so that they seem softer when you are bumped with them or jump on them. Great for teaching colors, gross motor skills, and just adding another level of play for children!\n \n  I got these crush-proof balls for my small dog. I have a collapsible pen to put them in. Two balls were smashed in a matter of minutes. Obviously meant for small children and not small pets. A fair amount of money for something I can not use.\n \n  The balls are well packaged and sturdy. They hold up when having a firm grip on them.  My grandson loves them and has had many hours of fun!  I like the mesh bag for storage when he isn't using them.\n \n  My 15 month old daugher loves playing with these in her blow up pool. She rolls around, giggles, throws them and has a great time. They are durable enough but of enough to not hurt her, or the dog...\n \n  The balls were smaller than I expected but perfect for my 1 year old's hands as well as the 2 to 6 year olds that came to his first birthday party. I needed to order a second one to fill up the ball pit nicely but it was all worth it. My son still plays in the pit with the balls now and sometimes I join him. Even if I sit on them, they stay sturdy - I'm 180 lbs. I'm sure if I body slammed one, it would dent haha but when I sit in the pit, the balls stay put, at most bending in just a little and then they fix themselves.\n \n  I purchased these balls to go along with the pop up play tents I purchased on Amazon. Forget the tents, these balls are freakin awesome. My children love them. They are soft enough that when thrown at a child's face (happens daily!) they don't hurt, but at the same time they manage to keep their spherical shape. \n  I got one of these for my lo\u2019s first birthday. Dumped them into her pen, and a high pitch excited squeal ensued. She played with them for an hour until she couldn\u2019t keep her head up she was so tired. The mesh bag is perfect for storage and I plan on dropping it into the washer when the balls need cleaning - from a Pinterest hack. Am contemplating an additional bag to completely fill the pen.\n \n  Great for my toddler. You can put these in a little baby pool and your kids will have fun for hours. Keep in mind that 200 if these seems like a lot, but I could\u2019ve ordered 2 or 3 bags of 200 to fill a small kiddy pool.\n \n  Bought these for my then 5 month old and he loved it. ", "\n  Received a returned item. The balls smelled like feet, the balls were not the same size, some were discolored, and they are not crush proof. I would look else where for pit balls.\n \n  These are the perfect size. Colors are bright and vibrant. They don't crush/collapse but give enough when stepped on to not land you on your backside. \n  The balls are soft and lightweight so much that more than half of the balls arrived with dents / flat spots. See the photo to compare the volume of dented balls on the left vs good balls on the right. The balls are from one package. \n  I've changed my 1 star rating to a 5 due to a mix up at the Amazon Marketplace Warehouse sending me the wrong balls. When I finally received the right balls (these) I was very satisfied. They aren't as big as some of the other ones out there, but they are definitely durable, bright, and can take a bunch of toddlers bouncing around on them! The colors are vibrant!\n \n  Color is bright, plastic is not super thin, which is good. Small enough to fit in toddler hands. I would have gave 5 stars but the package arrived 16 balls short of 200. Sucks, but not worth the exchange process, and time for 16 balls. But beware, it happened.\n \n  The amount of balls is great, I wish they were a bit larger. Once they are in the ball pit, it\u2019s a bit disappointing. I need about 3 more bags to fit just the bottom, let alone to feel totally surrounded like you\u2019re actually in a ball pit. No fun in laying on a single layer of balls. Very anticlimactic.\n \n  Very nice size for toddlers to be able to pick up and throw and they are sturdy, but soft enough that if an adult stepped on one it would crush rather than make you fall (which is nice lol)\n \n  I wasn't looking for the Plastic balls but bought them as suggested when I bought the trampoline.Thank you for the suggestion! She actually played more with the balls than she did  jumping on the trampoline. She is almost 2 years old  and she was very excited playing with the balls.\n \n  A ton of balls for the ball pit for my kids, they love them! They're the perfect size for them to pick up and throw around / play with. I love the mesh bag they come in. I should have ordered quantity two, 200 balls isn't that much when it comes to filling up a ball pit!\n \n  I've accidentally stepped on a few of these and can vouch for their crush-proof structure. We have them in a baby pool for my daughter and they're the perfect size for her to hold (and chew on). Vibrant colors!\n ", "\n  We bought these for our ball pit. I liked that they weren't made with all the yucky chemicals. The colors are nice and bright. If you are looking to fill a ball pit I would recommend getting more than 200 balls, it wasn't very many once dumped in. Also they crush really easily and there's no way to fix them.\n \n  SAVE THE MESH BAG!  It's brilliant.  My two four year old nephews had so much fun in their new ball pit that one of them had an accident (number one) and they still wanted to stay in the ball pit and play!  We had to take it away from them.  We easily bagged up all the balls and sprayed them down with cleaner and the hose.  The balls keep surviving these boys so the quality is there.  Buy more than you think you need bc it takes a lot to fill a small pit.\n \n  I love these plastic balls. I purchased them for our out door pool. It is so much you can do, see how many you can sit on in the water, assign colors to each, see who can grab their color put in a plastic bag, the fun is priceless. When in the house I open a large 360 suitcase put balls in for my 2 and 4 year old. They come with their own mesh storage bag.\n \n  I bought a million of these it seems and my dog likes to get a hold of them and even with her teeth they don't get flat. I'm surprised. My kids are having a blast in their ball pit. They jump in and everything and they withstand the pressure.\n \n  The quality of the balls are good. My only issue is it says \"200 balls\"  but there are only 138 balls in the bag I received.\n \n  Balls are not standard size! Too small and does not fill anything! Waste of $$\n \n  Bought these for our ball pit. 200 sounds like a lot, but we definitely needed to buy a second pack to fill it up. These are very light weight balls and they squish pretty easily. But they aren\u2019t going to hurt anything (or anyone) if your little one likes to toss them around.  My son loves these, so overall I am happy with this purchase.\n \n  These never get squished and hold their form perfectly. I only wish their cost per ball was less because I would love to make a ball pin but it would take several of these packs. My daughter enjoys playing with them though.\n \n  As most reviews say, these are definitely cheap balls. I didn't mind because we bought the ball pit for our dogs and they are super tiny so I didn't think they would be able to crush them. \n  I bought these to place inside the play yard. Trying to make it slightly more enjoyable when I need a few minutes to finish a task. My 10 month old loves them! He has fun throwing them everywhere and keeps him happy for small durations. Balls are very durable and don't dent at all!\n ", "\n  LOVE THESE BALLS! they don't collapse when 1 year old sits on them. I just love them immensely.  The colors are bright and attractive to the kids.  I read other reviews on the similar ball pit products and they mentioned they collapse.  I am happy to have read the reviews on this one and that someone stated these DO NOT collapse - which is an incredible point to make. You cannot throw a dented ball...lol\n \n  I ordered these with the little swimming pool I got for my granddaughter, and then discovered my daughter-in-law had ordered a \"ball pit\", but had not yet ordered the balls. So my gift was a winner!! We look forward to seeing her playing with these when we go to Tampa for her first birthday. I love the various bright colors. Great teaching tool, even for little ones. \"Bring me the Red, the Green, etc.\" \"What color is this?\", \"Let's count the blue balls\". \"If we have three yellow and four green, how many balls do we have?\", etc. etc. Lots of learning opportunities with these balls. Great product.\n \n  Holds up against toddler boys throwing, stepping on, and sitting on them. Not one has lost its shape yet. Good amount of balls for a small ball pit.\n \n  I somehow accidentally ordered two instead of one however nonetheless they are nice little balls that I think will go well with the rocket tent I bought as well. Glad I got two instead of one because even just one didn't look like it would be enough to fill up the tent.\n \n  The balls are great but I love that they come in a sturdy mesh bag with a nice zipper. I use the bag to store the balls but I can wash& dry the balls in the bathtub, keeping the balls in the bag. The handle slips nicely over a clothes hanger until the balls and bag are dry.\n \n  These serve the purpose. You\u2019ll need at least 400 to semi fill a pack-n-play. 200 covers just the bottom but it\u2019s enough to keep my 11 month old occupied while I vacuum a room.\n \n  They are a bit smaller than other ball pit balls I used before. I will need to buy some more but they also sturdier than the ones I had before, so I  am happy. It looks like they will keep the air inside longer than the other brand. Be careful when you walk, you can easily slip and fall since the air does not escape when you step on them. So unless you use them in a ball pit with a soft surface I would let the children only sit or crawl in the pit so they won't get any bruises.\n \n  Very pleased with this balls. The size is small enough for a 1 year old to pick up but big enough not to put in their mouth. Purchased it with the folding ball pit. Very happy!\n \n  Says 200 balls come but was only 100 :( These are so small and definitely not worth the price! Do not buy!\n \n  Allowed us to create a ball pit at home without playing the \"what is this?\" game that happens in public pits.  Is it vomit?  Is it poop?  Is it 6mo old hamburger?  Who knows, but glad we don't need to play that game anymore.\n ", "\n  All 134 balls we got (not 200) were all dented, or completely crushed. But my nephew is a one year old and once he saw them, taking them away isn\u2019t much of an option. So it looks like I will have to buy more balls, elsewhere. I would also love my money back for the balls I didn\u2019t receive.. and for any future buyers, just know, these are all crushable and will more than likely come that way before your child ever gets to play with them!!! I would keep looking and not buy these balls.\n \n  I purchased these for our mobile church nursery. They are bright and the children love playing with them. Even the littlest of hands can pick them up. I love the bag that they come with because it makes it easy to wash them all together in a large sink in the classroom and let them dry outside in the sun before packing them up each week. Instead of a traditional ball pit, we put them in a small blow up kiddie pool and this is a great amount of play balls to fill the pool.\n \n  We got what we ordered. 200 balls sound like a lot. We tried to make our daughters pack n play into a ball pit. Definitely covers the bottom but about 2-3 balls deep. Seems good quality and haven\u2019t seen any crushed balls yet. Should\u2019ve ordered 400-600 to do a proper ball pit.\n \n  We put some of these on our trampoline and it has been a MAJOR blast. A few have crushed...but with a bunch of kids jumping on them, I wouldn't expect any different. Two thumbs up!\n \n  These shipped quickly and were a great 1st birthday gift for a friend's kid! They were a little smaller than I expected, but I didn't look too far into them when I ordered. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of ordering and quality of product. I will recommend to others!\n \n  These balls work for a ball put the down side is when they need to be cleaned they have little holes so they fill with water. Unfortunately for me that freaks me out. They are a thinner plastic so they fold easily.\n \n  These have proven to be \"un-breakable.\" My 4 year old and 7 month old are having a blast. My 7 mo sits and plays in the pool while my 4 yr old boy jumps on them. They are high-quality. I'm glad I spent about 2x to get these over cheaper ones I found first. \n  I purchased this set of balls to go along with the Pericross Play Tunnel/Tent/Ball Pool. The balls were very colorful and they don't crush when the kids get into the ball pool. But you will need lots more than 200.  The 200 balls did not fully cover the bottom of a small ball pool. I had to order more. I purchased the 400 balls package on the next order so that we have a total of 600 and that seems to be a good amount to play in. Makes a nice full layer in the bottom. I would recommend these.\n \n  The quality of the balls is great. I don't understand why others are saying they are easily crushed. They \"squish\" when squeezed between your fingers but they don't crush. They're meant to give a little in order to be soft enough to play in. The colors are bright and fun and the plastic feels durable. We bought 200 to fill a pack n play for my sons first birthday. 200 will only cover the bottom in one layer really but that's enough for him. If you're wanting enough to \"swim\" in I would get 400.\n \n  Bought as a gift for my nephew's 1st birthday to go into a ball playpen.  Had to order two to fill up the playpen and will be reordering more.  Big hit with all the kids.  Delivered within a few days just as ordered.\n ", "\n  These balls have no holes in them which I love but the balls are smaller than the normal balls in a ball pit.. Other than that I need about 6 more bags to fill the ball pit my husband and I got out son.. And I will be buying these ones!\n \n  My child love playing with these Pit Balls. These colorful balls are an amazing way to keep him happy and energized all day. The strong, reusable, different color collection, easy to storage, and crushproof featured these balls are really a perfect gift idea for your child if you want to keep your child as happy as possible.\n \n  These are so much more durable than the last ones we bought! They can still be popped but under more reasonable means than the others. Would definitely buy again\n \n  These balls are great. Not sure why they've gotten any bad reviews. We've had these balls in a ball pit for like 6 months. My 18 month old still lives playing in it multiple times a day.  They are easy to clean and don't seem to be affected at all by weight. I get in the ball out with my son sometimes.. My 6'4 250lbs husband gets in the ball out with him and they hold up great.\n \n  All we wanted to do was fill the pack and play up with balls for our little guys, after going to a local kids play place! These are perfect! He had so much fun playing in them, we even bring them into the tub to play! They don't squish, they are the perfect size, bright colors and we plan in buying more here soon! Thank you for making an affordable toy for our little guy! I tell so many of my patients with little kids where to get them and how great they are!\n \n  This item was purchased as a Christmas present for my great grandson. He seems to be really enjoying it. I haven't found anything to dislike about the product.\n \n  My daughter LOVES these!! The bright colors catch her attention and she is so easily distracted by them. It\u2019s like having 200 toys for her to play with. It\u2019s also very soft rubber? So she can hold it in her hand easily without it slipping out. Highly recommend!\n \n  200 balls sounded like a lot, but when I dumped them out I realized it really isn't that many. To fill up our little inflatable pool would probably take quite a few of these packs and at over $20 a pop it isn't going to happen. Probably pretty fun if you have a smaller area to play with them in so that it feels like there are a lot. The balls themselves seem quite nice though.\n \n  These are great my 2 yr old nice loves them. 200 balls fills the bottom of a play pin for reference she likes to cover herself to \"hide\" I received them in 2 mesh bags they store great under the bed and are brightly colored. She bites them but they can be molded back to the right shape. They are soft and don't hurt when you get hit by them. It doesn't take long to clean up even when they are all over the living room and kitchen.\n \n  They really *dont* crush. It\u2019s amazing. And I counted; we got exactly 200, per order.\n ", "\n  Put in a small pool or laundry basket works great for my puppy Arya. I don\u2019t know what I would do without it!  She is very busy and this keeps her entertained for hours\n \n  As soon as I opened these up and put them in a pool I wanted my kids meal and ice cream so badly. All the memories will flood back and you might jump in faster than your kids. These are pretty hard to break and easy clean if you use a tub. Also buying a kiddie pool or using them in a tub is the best option. You definitely need to buy atleast 3 -4 of these to fill something out if you want it to look good.\n \n  Really love these! 200 balls aren\u2019t as many as you think they\u2019re going to be, so I really need another bag!! But, yes, these are a good buy & it\u2019s super awesome a bag is included!\n \n  If you are buying these to supplement existing balls in a bounce house or similar...don't bother, they are not 2.5\" in diameter. I measured them with a Digital Caliper and It repetively read 2.3 and not much more. In addition, many of the balls contain i consitant plastic wall thicknesses, makkng them prone to crushing and deformation. Not exactly as advertised!\n \n  I bought the balls to go with my daughters castle bounce house that came with balls as well, but the balls are too small and not the same size as the balls that came with the bounce house (Amazon suggested the balls with the bounce house).  I would prefer to exchange the balls for bigger ones, but I'm outside the exchange /return window.  I ordered the set in advance to ensure everything would arrive prior to my daughters 1st birthday party.  The balls have never been open.\n \n  We received a Disney ball pit for our little one and didn't come with many plastic balls so we purchased these based on reviews.  They are great! our little one started using it them at 11 months and at 15 months still plays in the ball pit and no crushed balls to date.  I tested them and an adult can crush them but for a small baby or toddler to do it, they would truly have to try to deliberately crush them.  Not likely to crush with normal play.\n \n  Guess I didnt read well enough that these are only 2.5 inches, but a good quality I guess is that they do not dent in when I squeeze them. We are playing adult hungry hippos so guess they will be good enough\n \n  I originally bought one bag to go into a bouncy house for my kids. These were great and all the kids at my son's birthday party loved them. I recommend buying 2-3 bags right off the bat. You need more than you think. I bought my second bag last week. The more balls the better! They squish easily and you will lose a couple her and there. I've had 3 kid parties so far and they've been pretty durable. Recommended.\n \n  I bought these to go with \"Kuuqa Kids Ball Pit Ball Tent Toddler Ball Pit with Basketball Hoop\". They are great! I got 2 or 3 to fill up the ball pit. It seems like more than it actually is.. Haha. I would get multiple if you're filling up a ball pit.\n \n  The balls are lightweight and easy to manage for my 19  months old.  He prefers throwing them to frolicking in them and I'm okay with that because they are almost weighless.\n ", "\n  These balls are basically exactly what I envisioned when I started my search on Amazon.  You get a ton of ball pit balls that are easy to wash/clean and survive being trampled and crushed to a reasonable degree.  I would suggest going with the higher count bag if you are debating as visualizing a large amount of these balls can be difficult and 200 doesn't go as far as I thought it would.\n \n  My 10 month old granddaughter absolutely loves the ball pit. She wants to stay in it all day! \n  Either I am crazy or these are WAyyyyy too small!  I was wanting larger balls. To fill a pack-n-play half way you will need at least five orders!\n \n  Totally worth the money. We have put these balls to the test and they will not crush. My husband and I have accidentally stepped on them and they have not lost their shape. I recommend these for sure!\n \n  Bought these to go with the kids play tent and ball pit.  Balls are very colorful.  Big enough for toddlers to handle and attempt to put in their mouth, but too big to actually put in their mouth.  Really liked the zippered bag to store the balls in when we pack up the play yard.\n \n  I bought these for my daughter that is 6 months and she has been in love with them for a while, we teach her the colors and she also love to hit and scatter them everywhere, she likes to try and eat them as well. We feel comforted that the material is durable and safe for her to put her mouth on and play with!\n \n  These are exactly what they are supposed to be. They're not super thick, but they do their job. I used them to fill up an inflatable kid pool. It filled it in with a single layer, so if I wanted it to be more like a ball pit, I'd need another bag.\n \n  Baby and I love these balls.  She can even say \u201cball\u201d now.  We bought the play tent too but honestly you could just get the balls and cover a room with them.  We also like to fill the bath tub.  She loves to pull them under water and see them pop back up.  They are soft enough to handle a good fall but strong enough to handle a 15 month old that likes to test everything to it\u2019s limits.\n \n  Wish I would have read the reviews or description better. Didn't realize the balls would be so small. Compared to the ones that came with her blow up pool, these are tiny! They seem sturdy, and my daughter can't tell, so it's fine, but for a purchase of 200 balls, I expected to receive 200 balls. And expected them to fill at least the bottom of the pool. I'll buy bigger balls next time to fill the space.\n \n  Says 200 balls and unfortunately we only received 98 balls.  Super disappointed considering I paid extra for double the amount and was shafted.\n ", "\n  If it was n\u2019t for my daughter, I really would n\u2019t buy it. It \u2019s good. The price is a little expensive. I want to buy more but it \u2019s more affordable.\n \n  Cost is high for my taste but these balls are far more durable than I expected. He ones that came with his ball pit were garbage and coupled with just his 24lbs. These however have made it through a party with kids aging 6mo-7 years and worked perfectly\n \n  My year and a half old niece and nephew just love playing in their ball pit. As sweet revenge on my sister I made sure that I bought two bags of balls. They are well made and have held up way after Christmas.\n \n  They are awesome. I bought a little playpen to go with this product and  now have a mint ball pit. Age doesnt matter. You will love playing in this with your child, if you can create a pit with it.\n \n  My 11 month old twins love these balls and they are a good size for them to play with. The 200 pack is plenty in their playpen for them to have fun and still have room to move around. However, the \"crush proof\" claim is not for babies or toddlers who are teething. My sons have bitten these and once they get a tiny hole in them they are very easy to crush. Just a heads up for anyone who maybe be buying these for their little one. Wasn't expecting a kid with only four teeth to do that kind of damage.\n \n  So i got them for our pig. Very durable, sturdiness. Plus,there not harmful  in anyway. So if they can stand up to a pig ,good enough for us\n \n  So happy with my purchase. Great addition our play area the girls were so excited we didn\u2019t even make it out of the driveway before they jumped in the ball pit. I ordered this bag of 200 plus an additional 100 to fill up our little kiddie pool. Fun for my 1yo all the way up to my 8yo. Lots of hours of fun.\n \n  Lots of fun - will wind up everywhere but they can\u2019t be swallowed and are lightweight so a child can\u2019t hurt another one by throwing them\n \n  Ordered the larger amount to fill a small ball pit that my son was gifted for Christmas. I thought 200 balls would be plenty...they barely cover the bottom of the 2'x2' area! The quality is good and they have withstood almost 6 months of use, but somehow the quantity is deceiving.\n \n  My baby loves these and so do I. The colors are amazing in person. The pictures do them no justice. They\u2019re also smooth and lightweight. Occasionally I have to toss a few in baby\u2019s ball pit while he\u2019s asleep and they hardly make a sound.\n ", "\n  I highly recommend you reconsider. I find balls in every nook and cranny of my house now. :(\n \n  This did not appear to be200 balls to me. We counter at least 150. It\u2019s a good product. This is an 8 ft pool they were placed in and barely noticeable.\n \n  We use these balls to play Hungry Hippos with her Girl Scout Troop. They worked great. None of the girls stepped on or hurt themselves on the balls, none of the balls were damaged, and they did not dent. Had no problems with these!\n \n  Nice quality balls that do not smash.  Second set that we have purchased.  Tip: When the bag starts to get full, zip all but 2\" and push in all the balls otherwise you will never get all the balls back in the bag.\n \n  This is the 3rd Batch of 200 Package of balls purchased and 102 are defective! I have already returned 2 other orders of 200 Package balls each because they were all defective. This is ridiculous! What a hassle. I don't have the time to keep returning these in hopes of getting an actual batch of CRUSH PROOF balls as they are advertised. I wish I could get my money back \u2026 unless Click N Play wants to give me some free balls for all the inconvenience.\n \n  What can I say?! It\u2019s balls! Who doesn\u2019t like balls?! It was all over the place but the kids had a great time with it. The good thing is that when they threw it at each other it didn\u2019t hurt lol.\n \n  I\u2019ve been used this ball 2years so far. That is why I boughr one more bag recently. Most of part I\u2019m very satisfied with this. It\u2019s crush proof so even if my son and his friends play pretty rough it still fine. Couple of balls are little bit not perfect condition, but not a big problem!\n \n  We put two of these into a ball pit we got for our little guy and he loves them. Jumps into the pit and they hold strong. They work very well.\n \n  Little expensive for plastic balls, but the quality is there. I didn't count but I thought 200 balls would amount to a little more then it did.\n \n  No dents and we\u2019ve had these for 6 months. We do not use these everyday, just bring them out on rainy days to use with a fold up tunnel system. Great for the price! One bag was enough for a couple hours of fun for a 1 y/o and 5 y/o.\n ", "\n  I read the reviews, and I got 200 balls (yes, I counted). We added them to a little swimming pool that our kids can slide into. The balls were as described and not too hard or soft. Someone said they squish easily, and we have not had that experience and our kids are playing with them daily. I also like the variety of colors. I think the price was good compared to what I found from other companies and in stores.\n \n  Picture looks bigger than real life. Each ball is a little smaller than a base ball. \n  Not my first time buying these. Great buy. Just wish they were a bit cheaper. But they hold up great and I love the vibrant colors.\n \n  Definitely should be cheaper. 200 balls isn\u2019t anything inside the ball pit I bought them for even thought th ball pit suggest one 200 ball pack is enough. For a one year old it can be enough but for any older kid they need 2 or 3 200 balls pack to have fun\n \n  Surprised by quality. Of course it says crush proof but was t sure what to expect. Way better than the McDonald's balls they had in their ball pits. I will say that I wish I had order more. 200 barely puts a thin layer in a pack and play.\n \n  Perfect for my little man small enough he can hold but not too small that you would want more. If you want a fuller looking ball pit I would recommend probably a bigger ball size but these were perfect for us.\n \n  Great deal for my grandson. The balls are soft and bright. He sat in the cardboard shipping box and played with them before they made it to his ball pit.\n \n  My one-year-old bit and then crushed some of these \"crush-proof\" balls within minutes of her first play session in them.\n \n  Great quality balls that don\u2019t get crushed. We had a great time throwing them around when my daughter opened them on Christmas, and they didn\u2019t hurt when they hit you.\n \n  Smaller than expected and definitely flimsy compared with the balls that originally came with my daughter's ball pit.  We bought these to add to the existing ones but you can see the obvious difference.\n ", "\n  I ordered a set of 200 from Amazon\u2019s Warehouse deals and they arrived fast and in great shape. There\u2019s definitely the full 200 balls in the bag. No complaints and we have a rambunctious boy who plays with them. None of squished yet, very happy.\n \n  These are very sturdy and resist getting dented or damaged when bigger kids (adults) are in the ball pit.  200 just doesn't go very far so we ordered a couple thousand more and now they're everywhere!  Very fun and well worth it.  200 is the right amount for a small ball pit (3 foot circle) and a young baby/toddler.\n \n  Great for the price. Don't be fooled thinking 200 balls is going to fill a baby ball pit!  200 sounds like a lot but barely covers the floor.  The product is great but if you want to fill a pit then you need to buy more!\n \n  So I had to write a review because I was extremely skeptical of crush proof balls for a ball pit most of the time they are so crappy. \n  Received 180 balls. Not 200 as stated. Otherwise, decent quality but available for less than half this price on Ali-express.\n \n  The balls are for the jungle gym that I bought for my Grandson. He really enjoys playing with the balls inside the jungle gym and in the house. I will buy it here again in the future. well done to the company. THANK YOU\n \n  I bought these balls to go in a pin for my twins 1st birthday. They arrived on time. I was expecting them to be bigger in size. The description said 200 balls, even though it looks like 100. If you want to cover the floor of the pin you will need at least 2 of these. They are durable. Overall I liked them I just would want more.\n \n  Balls are quite smaller than I thought they would be. I bought the 200 pack thinking it would be plenty to fill my child's ball pit, however they seem to be almost half the size I thought which means I will probably have to buy another bag and for almost $30 a bag this purchase is becoming pretty salty.  Other than size the quality of the product seems legit...\n \n  good play plastic balls...we use for a \"ball pit\" and toys for my 9 month old and he really enjoys it.  We have only lost one by destruction from dog's teeth... puppy got excited and thought they were for her and not only for the baby\n \n  These have been holding up well. It is nice to have the mesh bag as well which is also still in one piece and functioning.\n ", "\n  Fun for a quick ball pit. We originally thought we were shorted. Joke is on us... we counted out 202. Thanks for the extras!\n \n  Nice little solid balls, but had I known how little 200 of these balls were I would have bought double, to at least fill half of the ball pen.\n \n  There are balls everywhere in my home because she loves them so much. She can chew on them if she desires, and these are perfect for children to learn to roll a ball.\n \n  High quality, vibrant colors, and filled his ball pin nicely. Highly recommend! Bought the 200 pack. Not sure it\u2019s exactly 200, but it was PLENTY for his small pin!!\n \n  The balls look like a good quality but I did not receive a mesh bag like it said in the discription and the plastic bag I did get was ripped.\n \n  This is a good value for the price. Balls are on the smaller size though. If you\u2019re trying to fill a ball pit order two or three. Item arrived fast.\n \n  Purchased these to fill up a ball pit and they have worked out wonderfully.  No odd smell like others I have seen at local retailers.  Did have to go back and order a second set to fill the ball pit properly, might order another just to have it even more full.  They are a great size for a toddler, not too big or two small and have not had one crushed or damaged yet after months of daily use.\n \n  The balls shipped quickly and were exactly as advertised. They seem to be pretty durable and crush proof. They are medium sized. Unfortunately, 200 didn't make a dent in covering the bottom of the ball pit we purchased... so we'll have to buy more balls in the future.\n \n  Although the listing says ball pit balls... these balls are much smaller than the average ball.. much smaller than I expected.. so just an FYI.... most likely will be returning as I\u2019m looking for the bigger balls...\n \n  Am please with this product. Other reviews weren\u2019t clear on the size of the balls\u2026they are 2 1/4\u201d diameter which makes them 7 1/2\u201d in circumference (slightly smaller than a tennis ball). The balls are firm but not hard and \u201cgive\u201d a little under pressure but retain their shape. I got them for the EocuSun play tent tunnel and ball pit and 500 balls will fill it about 1/3 of the way. I have 1 yr old twin grandsons and they love it!\n ", "\n  Balls are crushable.  Company misrepresenting the product cause my 7 month just squeezed a blue one and we're still trying to get it back to shape lol.  BUT I gave it a 3 star because my 7 month was able to grip it in his tiny hands and play with it.  The bigger balls (bought from another vendor) he can only push around and not pick up.  He got bored with those quickly. These entertain him longer.\n \n  Grandkids love them. Their parents not so much but that\u2019s the joy of being a grandparent, watching 200 balls roll around the floor then leaving to go home.\n \n  Been using these for about 2 months now. Easy to clean and holds up very well. Great value for the quantity. We love them.\n \n  A great pack of colorful balls at a great price.  I purchased these along with the Tent and Tunnel Set for my granddaughter and she loves playing with them.\n \n  These were purchased to add to a ball pit that did not come with many balls.  I year old loves having more balls to play with.\n \n  I got these for the ball pit. 200 balls are only enough to fill 1 or 2 layers. I think I need to get another 200 or 400 to fill it up. Anyway, my baby loves playing with the balls and enjoys the time inside the ball pit now. He can easily grab the ball. Catch and throw. Colorful. Durable. Safe. Definitely worth the money.\n \n  Love these! They are true to color and are really crush proof (unless the dog trys). Arrived very fast. My daughter plays in her ball pit every day, dad is usually in there with her and still only balls lost are to the dog. I also like that they don't smell that awful new plastic smell. We have a small ball pit with 400 of these balls in it and may purchase another 200 as she grows.\n \n  These held up better than the balls my child\u2019s ball pit came with. The ten balls that came with his pit can easily be squeezed and flattened. These balls are much more durable and for the price it\u2019s a good deal.\n \n  These bright and colorful balls are the best ballpit balls we've ever had. Even with my kids playing rough, they have yet to crush one of these. Easy for toddlers to hold, and to throw as well, lol!\n \n  Perfect for any ball pit and great value. Very durable my kid is really rough and they have lasted. Highly recommend\n ", "\n  I bought these for my son and he loves them. I know some of these can have a little ridge of plastic on them from production but I havent found any on these ones yet. I also tried to crush one with my hand and it bounced back so I stepped on it and the same thing happened. Almost as happy with these as my son is :) the mesh bag is also a nice little bonus for when they need cleaned\n \n  Seriously these things do not crush! Great balls for a ball pit (we used our pack and play instead of buying a cheap ball pit ;) ) We thought 200 would be a lot but it wasn't as many as we thought, but it's still a lot when they get thrown all through out the house and  you have to pick them all up! either way my boys love them!\n \n  We bought these to fill our kid's new ball pit, but overestimated what 200 balls would look like. It barely covers the bottom, which is fine for a one year old, but you'd need more to make the pit at least a little mysterious and exciting. The balls are soft and light, but they dont get squished easily either. Then again, our kid is pretty deliberate when he moves around in his ball pit. The only reason we docked a star off the review was the price seemed high.\n \n  Amazing quality! My 11 month old and 5 year old have played with these for a week now in the ball pit and none have broken. The colors are bright and fun and keep the balls keep the kids entertained for hours!\n \n  These's balls are the best! Okay I will admit that I had to air them out for a few hours when they arrived due to the plastic smell, but after that my kiddo was able to play with them and NOT destroy a single one. Seriously if you're sick of replacing balls that break in half you need to buy these. Awesome! Do it now!\n \n  As suggested the larger package would give more coverage in the play net, but for a one year old it was perfect.\n \n  I ordered this product as a Christmas gift a few years ago and they are still in great shape. They have been thrown, jumped on, laid on, kicked, squeezed amongst other things that toddlers do with their toys. They are literally indestructible! He still plays with them now so I am extremely happy with my purchase!\n \n  These were actually a lot nicer than I expected. All ball pit balls are overpriced, so these costing so much didn\u2019t surprise me. I would definitely buy these again\n \n  Bought these to add to my nephews ball pit and they\u2019re great! Exactly what you expect. Happy that I bought them!\n \n  Too expensive!!!\n ", "\n  I was shorted balls out of 3 out of the 4 packs I ordered. It would have been a good value if you received the correct amount in each set you ordered...\n \n  Great for making a ball pit for my toddler and still in use one year since the original order. Plated in and on by children of many ages up to 12, and they are going strong. Children love them! The size was perfect for our use.\n \n  I purchased these with the octagon ball pit. The ball pit is the perfect size for a small toddler so I was hoping 200 balls would be plenty. It actually could use 3-4 more bags so I will definitely be purchasing more! They are durable and super fun to play with.\n \n  I purchased this pack of 200 balls for my 2 1/2-year-old grandson for Christmas to use with the Playz 4 Piece Pop Up Children Playhouse, 2 Crawl Tunnel and 2 Tents.  These colorful and sturdy balls are such a hit and keep him occupied for hours!\n \n  RIDICULOUSLY expensive for a small amount of balls..... had to by like 6 packages to fill our little poll with them, which cost way more than it should for some cheap plastic balls. The daughter was happy with them, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019d buy anymore at this price.\n \n  A blow up bounce with these balls are perfect for toddlers and infants alike to play in for birthdays inside or outside.  Good for everyday play too.\n \n  I only ordered one bag to try them out. I liked it. I was about to make another order for 2 quantities but I notice the price went up in only 2 days. Really bummed me out. I would of ordered more.\n \n  Great for an indoor ball pit.  We filled an inflatable pool up with these and my twins are loving it!  Depending on the size of the play area you are filling, you may need more than one bag of these!\n \n  As expected. No sharp outlines on the balls as I know some parents worry about. I love the bags because they\u2019re easily stored.\n ", "\n  I waited until  these balls had been well used before writing a review. I made a life size Plunk-it game for senior residents to play at an assisted living facility and had enough left over to make a ball pit using a small,inflatable children's pool.  These balls are sturdy, hold their shape well, easy to clean and come in a variety of  vivid colors.  Priced right too!\n \n  Bought it as a gift! Liked the amount of balls and find it a great value for your money! Great for ball pit, learning colors and/or using just a few at a time!\n \n  These balls are great! They're soft enough to jump in or roll around in yet strong enough to resist denting or squishing! They have a little give when you squeeze them but they bounce right back! I haven't tried squeezing them hard enough to find the breaking point but they're holding up great with my 13 month old! Great quality!\n \n  Looking for ball pit balls? LOOK NO FURTHER!! These things are great. My child throws them, steps on the, lays on them, hits them on hard objects and even tries chewing them. They feel thin, and they do dimple a bit but it pops right back out and they are super durable.\n \n  I ordered These to go with a ball pit I ordered for my kids. They are true to the description and can not be crushed. I\u2019ll be ordering another pack!\n \n  Great for making messes with. Good thing there is 200 because you will lose some. We have not crushed one.\n \n  This was not as describe in no way did it come with 200 balls and was hardly 50 balls in the bag. So my kid now has a big pit with hardly any balls.\n \n  My grandson really enjoy playing with theirs balls inside he's fire engine tent. (which is sold separately.)\n \n  The ball bag arrive routed with a huge hole and balls everywhere in the box. We now have nowhere to store the balls. I needed it for a birthday gift on the day it arrived or I would've returned it.\n \n  Bought these for my one-year-old grandchild - good times were had by all.  They are exactly what they say - colorful plastic balls, to big for littles to choke on, but not too big for them to hold.\n ", "\n  I've purchased several brands and quantities from varying Amazon sellers and these are the best ones no doubt! Best size, accurate 200 count, 1 week in and 0 crushed. 10/10\n \n  These are amazing! I got these for my son after he destroyed countless balls because they were so flimsy and he could easily crush them! These ones are extremely durable and the colors are so vibrant!! I\u2019m ordering more bags to fill his race car ball pit\n \n  Kinda pricey considering you need more than one pack for fill baby ball pit. But definitely durable.  They dont bend or crinkle when baby chews on then or even sits on them\n \n  Got these for a small plastic wading pool. Instant ball pit for 1 year old! Has a zippered case for balls.\n \n  These were much smaller than I had imagined opon arrival , I worried if they would even cover the bottom of small ballpit I had purchased , but they did and parents said they were more than enough for just 1 toddler . They don't dent as some do .\n \n  Good price and the balls do not dent easily. Takes about 600-800 to cover a 4x4 area 6ins deep.\n \n  Balls are lovely bright colors and well made (no chemical smell, no cheap looking seam), however, they're smaller than you'd expect. Smaller than your usual ball pit balls (think Chuck E Cheese). They come in a nice mesh carrying case and the company is easy to work with; will fairly resolve any issue that arises and ships quickly!\n \n  8 months old and a must have!! We just put them in her pack n play. Works perfect! This is the 200 count which is the perfect amount, not too overwhelming and she won\u2019t get lost in them : )\n \n  Perfect! I bought these balls to use in my wall display. They were a perfect fit.\n \n  Exactly what I was looking for. The case is perfect for storing the balls after use, though we've yet to store them.\n ", "\n  These balls are truly crush proof, great quality, easy to clean and make for hours of fun for my 11 month old. I would happily buy these again. I will say 200 sounded like a lot but once it is in the ball pit I think 400 would have been better.\n \n  These balls are colorful and fun but crush under any amount of pressure. I just grabbed one too harshly and it collapsed in my hand.\n \n  Stinks i am lucky if i got 40 balls\n \n  My toddler loves this ! The balls are a decent size and truly do not crush (ive tried). I love that when its time to clean up you can put it right back in the bag it came in. I do not foresee the balls getting damaged in any way nor the bag. Both are great quality products. I highly reccomend !\n \n  More enough to fill small inflatable ball pit about 3 ft in diameter, only needed about 100 for that.  Good quality, glad they come with mesh bag for storage\n \n  Arrived really late, but that was UPS' fault. They are a little bit smaller than I thought they'd be, but they'll do just fine. Look better in person than in the pic. They are bright and colorful. I think my 1 year old will love playing with them in the ball pit we bought.\n \n  great balls! i would just say 200 balls is not as much as you think. we didn't buy another set yet because our baby is just 1 and this is enough for her for now. But i could see later on needing to buy another set. if you're purchasing for bigger kids or a bigger play area, you'll want more than 1 set of 200.\n \n  It was tore and looked like it was used. I ordered rocket ship got fish aquarium with missed spelled words and really faded fish and pitchers on it. It was sewed all lopsided and in all was really bad item to buy on line. \n  True to color. Good price compared to a lot. I'd get more than one though. Easily cleaned.\n \n  We bought these my 2 year old great niece to use on her trampoline! she loves them! perfect size for her and and light weight.\n ", "\n  tons of fun for kids not so much adults that have to pick them up when play time is over..\n \n  Balls have been great for our ball pit. They are light weight, colorful and 200 is a good amount for the  KUUQA, 400 would be fun too.\n \n  I was worried they would crush but they did not. My 13 month old grandson plays with them in a ballpit we bought him for his birthday. Adults have gone in there too and still the balls held up.  Good size, fun to throw and really match every room in the house :D\n \n  The quality is great. The balls are smaller than store bought balls. They do not cave in like store bought. So they are great!\n \n  The bag was bigger than I thought it would be. Good amount of balls. My 2 year old loves them. They are a little squishy and not hard.\n \n  Six different colors of balls all filled with air so they don\u2019t break or dent. Giving three starts because there are not 200 balls per bag. Each bag I bought contained about 160-180. Seems to be common issue.\n \n  I bought one of these to fill a ball pit that I purchased for my children, but I need more! The colors are bright, and they really are crushproof! They love to play with these, and they are pretty indestructible. My 10 month old likes to gum them! I will be ordering more soon!\n \n  Just enough balls to line the bottom of the ball pit we purchased (Dreampack Kids Ball Pit Playpen Ball Tent Pool with Basketball Hoop and Zippered Storage Bag, 3.28 ft/100cm).  The balls are durable and have not been bent or smashed by our 9mo twins, they have maintained their shape.\n \n  The product description says 200, but I would say only 100 balls are actually in the package. This was ordered to fill a play tent ball pit. This bag of \"200\" balls barely covered 1/2 of the tent. The tent fits 2 toddlers...and is not big at all... \n  I purchased these plastic balls for a ball pit for my 2 small dogs. I read several reviews that stated the balls were \"sturdy\" enough for kids and pets, so I purchased them. Balls were destroyed within week.\n ", "\n  These are great and perfect for ball pits, but just FYI - 200 sounds like plenty of balls but it isn\u2019t! We bought two sets of 200 and honestly still have room for more in our ball pit. And the ball pit we have isn\u2019t all that big!\n \n  Great for our ball pit. Kids love them. My only real complaint is they took a month to get here.\n \n  We purchased these to go into the Ball Pits for Toddlers Kids Play Tents for Boys Tunnel Indoor Outdoor Children Pop Up Playhouse Girl Baby Toys with Mini Basketball Hoop 5pc Set. It is enough to fill the ball pit to the depth of about 3 balls deep. This way they were not spilling out and everyone could sit in and play.\n \n  These balls are thinner and smaller than what you would find in commercial play ball pits.  They wont hold up to larger kids and adult use.  Great for price and qty to put in a small tent for little toddlers.\n \n  Did not receive 200 balls!!! More like 80 total rip off \n  Bright colors! I washed mine before giving to child. A 2.5'x2.5'x 8\" tall box was perfect for these balls. Perfect for a 6 month old hands. When he saw me washing them he started crawling right over to play with them! (And my 6 month old is a shy crawler!)\n \n  Good idea, and our kids enjoys playing inside the playground where they are stored for him. I did think they are not very durable, are easily damaged or punctured. We have had to through many for tht very reason, as our son will lay on them and easily squish them. I wished they were made of more solid plastic.\n \n  Great but you will need more than 200 for a kiddie pool...seems like a lot till you put them in a kiddie pool will need at least 300 to 400.\n \n  Every single kid I've seen come across these (I filled a small pool with these at my kid's birthday party) absolutely LOVES them. No joke. Make sure you keep them contained behind a gate or a kiddie corral because if you let them loose in the house, they will wind up everywhere.\n \n  Doesn't quite look like 200 balls, but if you say it is... I would purchase at least 400 balls to start off then order a few more. I found Walmarts' Play Day balls to be a bit larger.\n ", "\n  Not quite sure how someone can screw up a series of little plastic like balls! So far these have held up to the content abuse of my 10 month old son. Surprisingly they are almost like air filled? As you cannot concave the balls easily, like the cheap balls at a McDonalds or the like!\n \n  Price seemed (and still does) high for what it is but they balls have held up great so far. Would buy again.\n \n  Perfect for what we needed and what we wanted to spend. Both the kid and the dog love romping around in these either in the ball pit or in the kiddie pool.\n \n  189 balls not 200 that's my only issue.  The balls are different thicknesses but still worth the money. #mommyapproved\n \n  I felt good about ordering these to go in the 'ball ten't that I ordered for my granddaughter because they are Phthalate Free.  Very study and 200 is the perfect amount for the tent I ordered.  Lightweight but not thin.  Good purchase!!\n \n  I love these, they are so durable! I got in the ball pit with my son and when trying to get out I stepped on a few of them and they didn't break! They are much smaller than I expected but are of much higher quality.\n \n  These worked very well for a game that they got thrown around and abused.  They held up well and ready for their next activity.\n \n  It makes a great mid summer Christmas decoration as the balls are littered all over Leigh yard every single day all of the time no matter how many times I pick them up. Glass half full.\n \n  These are definitely crush proof. Wish they were larger like the traditional balls.\n \n  In the pix you can see the size compared to a mid size ferret and a 5 & 6yo! These balls are great quality. They are not that soft (which is a good thing), lightweight, and I think they would be considered the middle size of this industry of ball.\n ", "\n  True to size. I didn't count them tho. Lol. There's a full bag seems like alot.\n \n  Bought two packages for the indoor ball pit.  Kids love them, but they don't stay in the pit all the time\n \n  These are small and smush but if you need balls for a kids ball pit this is perfect. I bought two bags and they fit in the ball pit perfectly.\n \n  We got these for our Grandsons 2nd birthday to put in his pop up tent.  He was so happy and loved playing in there with these and his little sister!\n \n  My grandson is over 14 months and is just starting to crawl. He has had some problems from birth and he just loves this soooo much. It helps him scoot on his belly through the tunnel.  His physical therapist said that was a wonderful thing for him for Christmas. It is very durable and easy to put up and take down or even move it from one place to the next with the colored balls inside it. I would recommend this to anyone with a little one. My other grandkids are 8 and 10 years old and play with him in it so you know how durable that has to be.\n \n  These are as expected. \n  My daughter loves these. We bought 2 bags for her to play with the FocuSun playpin ball pit that is 39 in diameter and two bags fills it about halfway which is perfect because it's full enough to give a real ball pit experience without an overflowing mess.\n \n  My grandsons love playing in their ball pit.  I ended up getting 2 bags for twice the fun!\n \n  Planned an amazing civil war simulation for my kids at school. Was very excited when I found these and ordered them. Was extremely disappointed when they arrived and it was a baking sheet..they sent me a Wilton\u2019s baking sheet..now I am left scrambling at the last minute to try and come up with a new plan. I expect a refund and for the balls to be sent.\n \n  A lot of balls, only use 25 at a time with our baby. ", "\n  Best gift ever purchased for a one-year-old. He spends hours playing with the balls\n \n  Like the storage option to put it away. Not best value for what you get considering how much they make them for..\n \n  I should have gotten two bags, but they are the perfect size, the two year old loved them.\n \n  Love these balls.  They are soft and don\u2019t hurt when jumping into the ball pit but strong enough that they don\u2019t crush easily.  They have held up after 1.5 years with a very active 2.5 year old.\n \n  I bought this product for my 1 year old BB. Both my wife and myself love these colorful balls ! This product is among one of the highest quality products we have ever bought from Amazon.\n \n  Great item son loves playing \n  These are smaller than most ball pit balls but they dont cave so bad ass\n \n  Excellent quality. More than I would have liked to spend on plastic balls, but you get what you pay for here.\n \n  Thought they\u2019d be larger. Kids love them. Split into two one bag for the tub and the other on their trampoline. They love to jump and throw them\n \n  Balls are light for kids to play with. Color are bright. They are easy to clean. Like the fact they are safe if a child want's to chew on them.\n ", "\n  You need to order more than what you think. Nothing against the balls. You just really don\u2019t understand the volume until you empty them out.\n \n  Amazing!! These have no scent and do not crush! We have a cheaper set from another brand and the difference is incredible! I don\u2019t mind my toddler playing with these.\n \n  These are perfect to dump in a play pen for a young toddler to enjoy!!!\n \n  I love the balls but the price is just a little high. We purchased 2 packs now and probably going to bed 1 or 2 more to get to the level we\u2019d like in our baby girls ball pit.\n \n  My 6 month old LOVES these, I got the $10 pop up play pen and he sits in the balls and just loves it. They are small enough that he can hold the balls but big enough they cant hurt him. Best spent money.\n \n  Great colors and size. Just wish I could get more balls for the price.\n \n  Really dissatisfied w/ this purchase. Complete $30 rip off! Less than 200 ball. The balls are really small, smaller than a tennis ball. Will not cover the bottom of a tent.\n \n  We ordered 1 bag for our daughter\u2019s 1st birthday. We thought we could turn her Pack N Play into a ball pit. \n  Good color variety but NOT crush proof when given to dogs as a Christmas/ Hanukkah present. Their teeth pierce through the balls quite easily. Also the carrying case was handy but easily ripped as well by dogs. It didn\u2019t look like 200 balls when I threw them all at once, but it felt like 208 balls when I was picking them back up. Are these crush proof for babies?\n \n  BALLS!  Nice size for a ball pit. Kinda of  pricey, but you can\u2019t beat the convenience of shopping on Amazon.\n ", "\n  Okay quality and do the job for filling the ball out. I have seen much higher quality for a little more .\n \n  These have lasted FAR longer than any other brand I have purchased in the past. They are a perfect size and don\u2019t crush.\n \n  This is a solid buy if you want to make your own ball pit. Strong ball, and it is nice that you can put them back in the sack and throw them in the laundry to clean.\n \n  Love them! Took 2 bags to the nanny, the kids have a blast all day, ordered 3 more for me to go along with a ball pit tube game set. The colors are shiny and pretty!\n \n  They were pretty good quality! They were too small for what i was using them for and when i was putting them back in the bag i didn\u2019t have 200 balls!! So count them before using them make sure you are getting the right amount! But the quality of them like i said was good! Just not want i needed\n \n  Son is 9 months old and loves them. Purchased 200 and need to buy more since they cover one layer on playpen floor. Great quality. There are a handful of other types of balls in my pic cause my dog will get them if they aren't in the playpen.\n \n  Wish they would have said somewhere theyre about half the size of regular ones. They're still balls, but I would have ordered bigger ones had I known.\n \n  They definitely lie theres just 164 in the package and they brand themself saying that theres 200 balls ! Total fraud\n \n  I got these in addition to a gift for my sons for a ball pit and they are great and sturdy just like the others and come in a mesh bag for storage\n \n  Colorful and fun. Got these to fill a small ball pit and it worked perfectly.\n ", "\n  The balls are a great addition to the parachute.  They are bright and colorful.\n \n  Exactly what it says they are. They were great for the price, I would buy again.\n \n  Great deal on these balls. Super colorful and haven't been crushed yet.\n \n  The quality I expect, the colors are bright and the kids are happy\n \n  Probably the best 30$ we ever spent. Screw buying a play pen to put them in (we did). My toddler put them in a diaper box and climbed in it like he was bathing in them lol. Then we tossed them in the pack and play. We bought those little pop up tent things with the tunnels but the balls don't stay in there at all lol.\n \n  Pretty, no smell, slightly smaller than the ones we have, but that seems to make them far less crushable.\n \n  The description says 200 balls but you actually don\u2019t get the 200 like so many other people who didn\u2019t receive their full order. I counted them one by one And I received 195 so 5 balls were missing\n \n  The shipping took longer than promised. I was not in a rush to get them, so it really didn't matter.  What DID matter  was that I paid $37 for 200 plastic balls and only received 187 balls and they are considerably smaller than I was hoping for.  Didn't even cover the bottom of a very small toddler ball pit!  Not satisfied :(\n \n  The product description lists the number of balls and their dimension, but I was visualizing a larger volume of balls.  Anyway, the kids love them!\n \n  Just as described! Bought these with the collapsible tents/tubes!\n ", "\n  These are good quality balls. They have lasted with my one year old grandson and my Saint Bernard playing with them. The 200 count only filled the bottom of the ball pit I bought.\n \n  Bought 400 for a ball pit. It\u2019s half full. Good balls for the price. My 1 year old son has tried to eat them and they have withstood the test!\n \n  We purchased these as a gift for a first birthday. They were delivered along with the tent in an oversized box. We put the storage bag and collapsible ball put at the bottom of the box and had the loose balls on top and then wrapped the box. It was a huge hit.\n \n  These were exactly what I was looking for . There durable and you can't find a better price in quantity anywhere . I love the case it makes it easy to move them in or outside based on my needs for my kids. Buy a ball pen to go with it or not and kids will absolutely love these. I highly recommend them.\n \n  I bought these and another large pack from a chain store. These are far superior, they hold up better and don\u2019t feel like they will break easily. My son absolutely loves them\n \n  Bought this with the playz 3 piece kids play tent.. my daughter is not really into the tent yet(she was 7 months at the time) but she loves playing with the balls.. the family and I end up having a ball fight with these and all the balls are still in tact...\n \n  Perfect ball pit balls- they are durable and they don\u2019t crush!\n \n  Bought the item to turn kids playpen into a ballpit.  When I received the balls they were much smaller than I anticipated.  I would say maybe 2/3 the size of what I think of when I think of ball pit balls, maybe even smaller.  Due to the size of the balls I had to order extra to fulfill my needs.\n \n  Works great for our ball pit, buy more than you this you need because they don't take up as much space as you would this they did!\n \n  These are sturdy and don't crush easily. I got two packages and it fully covered the floor of a child's ball pit that I purchased separately. My daughter (2 yr old) jumped in the pit repeatedly and none of the balls crushed.\n ", "\n  Kids love them. They aren't too firm but they shouldn't be. Kids fall in them and are safe.\n \n  great. I ordered this after a failed purchase from toysus where most of the balls were damaged. i was happy to see this arrive. the balls were larger and not crushed for about the same price.\n \n  Hate having to pick them up but love to see my daughter happy\n \n  Over a period of time I bought a 100 pack of these, then I went ahead and bought the 200 pack for my toddlers ball pit! She loves these and always runs and dives in it like it is a swimming pool:)\n \n  These are fun. We have a very large, caged trampoline. I bought these to throw in there for my sons 5th bday. I only bought 1 because they are a little pricey, but it would have been way cooler with 3 or 4 bags. Good quality.\n \n  They're perfect as long as your child doesn't chew on them. However we are the proud parents of a 1yr old piranha.\n \n  I made a ball pit for my son. It really enjoys the pit and it helps with learning colors as well. Great product...bpa free...etc. Would order again when needed.\n \n  Plastic balls can be held by a toddler so make sure to buy plenty if you want to fill up a small ball pit.\n \n  Our kid and his friends are very happy about the ball pit!  Definitely worth every penny. \n  makes a mess, but hey.. the kids, and I mean from the teenagers to the toddlers play with that for hours throwing it on each other and picking it up afterwards only to throw it back up.\n ", "\n  We had a BALL playing with these! exactly what I wanted them to be!\n \n  These balls are so easy to pop and break. If you have a dog who loves balls I don\u2019t recommend this. Balls are very colorful and bright and we have used them to teach our kids colors. Also 200 balls doesn\u2019t seem like they really fill it up. (Will end up all over your house )\n \n  These ball pit balls are vibrant in color and seriously crush proof.  They have held up great to our one year old in comparison to some less expensive ball pit balls.  Would recommend this set!\n \n  These are great quality, no smell, arrived clean! They really do withstand quite a bit of pressure as my husband rests them out regularly by stepping on them and we have yet to get one damaged. Worth the extra money to get this great set.\n \n  Thought they would be crush proof but they crushed quickly. Would not recommend or purchase again. Also has me questioning Amazon\u2019s policy as they allowed the false statement\n \n  World great in the ball pit and they don't crush easily either. My 11 heart old daughter when loved to play in with the little ones!\n \n  These are exactly what they advertised. They could be squished if an older kid was playing with them but my 1 year old hasn\u2019t managed to squish them yet. Good buy!\n \n  I got these for my baby but they didnt put the 200 balls like they said there was few balls missing!\n \n  Great prices and great amount for either the ball pits or the cubes.\n \n  These balls are quite good. The colors are bright, they're the perfect size, and they're pretty durable. \"Crush Proof\" is totally false. My one year old bit into and crushed one within 5 minutes, but months later, the vast majority of these balls are still in great shape and used on a regular basis.\n ", "\n  what a hit with my 1 yr.old grandson when i got this for him for christmas along with the 4 ft ball pit,and we are still playing with it as he is coming up on 2.\n \n  Very cute. Smaller balls than expected. But does the trick.\n \n  Bright colors. The 200 just fill up the bottom of a large pack n play. My 15 month olds seem to enjoy them.\n \n  These balls are great! They don't crush, my 1 yo and 3yo have tried.  I love that they can't crush them down and put in their mouth like a lot of other play balls do.  And they are very light so they don't hurt when they throw them at eachother :) only con is having to pick them all up when they are spread all over the house!\n \n  Bought these to add to the play tunnel I purchased. Product fit my purpose.\n \n  My baby loves it. He often bites the balls heavily (although I don' allow he to do that) but only few of them are broken so far. The durability is better than I thought.\n \n  These are great! My son who is 31 lbs sits on them and body slams them and they don\u2019t bend. Perfect buy for his ball pit!\n \n  Awesome addition to a play area. Can\u2019t beat for the price.\n \n  Perfect. Bright and colorful balls look like they are  pretty decent quality.  My nine-month-old loves balls and he will love these.\n \n  Balls are smallish but so sturdy and durable:) My grandson loves them! Keep away from dogs- ours ate one and threw it up, but was just fine after. These balls are better than the ones my kids had as children. Stronger.\n ", "\n  You might want to order more than 1 package if wanting to fill a large space.  Overall very happy with the purchase.\n \n  Made to last. A good quality product for a good price.\n \n  $27 bucks for a bunch of plastic balls.  This world has gone mad!!!  How much profit are you people making??\n \n  Product as described! Would order from them again! Speedy service!\n \n  We bought these for my daughter she wanted them for her trampoline! Lots of fun!\n \n  These were perfect with the tunnel, nice weight and loved the bag to store them.\n \n  Three stars because they seem like really good quality, and the carrying case is a nice touch but I can not believe how overpriced these are. They won't even fill the small baby pool I have. The good quality is definitely not worth this much money for how many you get. You need at LEAST two packs to fill a small baby pool\n \n  Very happy with the balls! I received 200 and they are soft enough so they don't hurt, but strong enough so they dont crush.\n \n  These balls hold up SO well. Small dogs have even had issues damaging them (which is a good thing) They are no too hard and not to soft. And as a huge added bonus they are not in a fast food place playground. They came in a nice bag with a quality zipper that didn't break after a couple uses.\n \n  My son loves these! We have had them for 6 months and not one has crushed despite having a 30 lb toddler roll and jump in them! For a ball pit that\u2019s bigger (like maybe a baby pool or old pack n play) I would order two bags. We use a small storage ottoman as a ball pit and one bag was great.\n ", "\n  Works well enough for a ballpit, would buy again.\n \n  small balls perfect for 2 and 3 year olds.. will be excited to see my grandsons playing on easter and the net bag they come in will make it easy to store.\n \n  I ordered this 2nd set to just add a bit more to my grandson\u2019s ball pit because I was so happy with the 1st set but when it came we were disappointed!! It wasn\u2019t the same variety of colors- it was mostly orange! There weren\u2019t even any blue at all in the 200!\n \n  Bought these with an inflatable baby pool for indoor use- perfect\n \n  These balls are great! I used them in a \"baby ball pit\".\n \n  It's most likely my fault, because I didn't read the description well. These were quite small. I orderd this quantity of 250 imagining my grandkids playing in them. In reality, there were enough for a small dog to play in - maybe!. But, kids being kids, made the best of the ones we had.\n \n  Ordered these for my daughter's ball pit, they fill the bottom up. She absolutely loves them. Haven't had a problem with any of them cutting her, nor being too hard.\n \n  Strong and sturdy balls!  Work well in my granddaughter's ball pit, and sturdy enough that my small dog is able to use them for play.  Not sure who is getting greatest enjoyment out of them, my granddaughter or the dog!  Hold their shape well!\n \n  Great for parties or at home ball kits. Just as described. Very satisfied.\n \n  Missing balls- yep I did count. I am missing 12 balls. Pretty disappointed.\n ", "\n  I purchased these over a year ago ago for a pop up tunnel at his first birthday party . We're still having a blast with them.\n \n  I got this for my daughter for a small ball pit she has that didn't come with many balls. These balls are the same size as the other ones and are super durable. My kids love it so I love it.\n \n  Made a great ball pit in the small pack n play\n \n  Item took over 2weeks to get to me, I tried cancelling a couple of times but for some reason they wouldn't let me.  Once item arrived, a bit disappointed, not a lot of balls, you will need a whole lot more.\n \n  The balls are very nice vibrant colors. I bought 400 for a 5 section kids tunnel system. Will most likely buy more because the balls are VERY small.\n \n  These ball pit balls are durable and our kids love them in the ball pit we got for them!\n \n  Not only was there a ball missing ,but one came crushed. Other than that the balls are fine. I do wish they were a half inch larger becuase they're smaller than I expected. Vibrant colors and fun for the kids!\n \n  Got as a gift and the little kid loves them!\n \n  Not crash proof a bit pricey for what it is.\n \n  These balls are really cool. We got them to fill a kiddie pool to make a ball pit for my 1 year old daughter and her and her little friend we have over for play dates love the ball pit.\n ", "\n  Nice. Need two bags if filling the size of a small pool\ud83d\ude00\n \n  Exactly what I was looking for; sturdy balls -- as one can be with this type of ball\n \n  Very small balls, def not 200 in the package. I feel like I was ripped off! Super disappointed in the product received.\n \n  Son muy bonitos colores,no son duros lo \u00fanico es que necesito m\u00e1s pelotas para la piscina pero valen la pena.\n None \n  Mixed these with the Wonder Playball non toxic clear colored ones and they looked great together. Perfect size for the ball pit and little hands. Held up great against a birthday party with lots of very active kids. Would definitely recommend. Btw, ball pit balls are plastic and tiny... eventually would give as nothing is indestructible right?\n \n  Son 7 months old loves these!!! \n  Easy to crush. Waste of money.\n \n  These worked out great to fill our ball pit. They may get smashed but, they bounce right back into their original shape. There was enough to have a backup supply in case any get lost or destroyed.\n \n  My kids love putting it in the blow up pool.\n \n  Excellent! BABY LOVES THEM! YOU NEED AT LEAST 2 BAGS TO FILL EVEN THE SMALLEST SPACE. BEWARE THEY BEND AND FOLD.\n ", "\n  balls are quite small and did not half fill the pits\n \n  Package shipped and delivered on time, my son will love them however they were slightly smaller than your average ball pit ball and I will probably need to order another package to fill the pit.\n \n  Super disappointed with this purchase \n  These are perfect for the ball pit -- light weight and soft, so a small child or infant won't get hurt playing with them.  If you're buying them for the Basketball Hoop Ball Pit, 200 will suffice.  They won't quite cover the bottom (for that I recommend about 300 balls) but there's quite enough to play with\n \n  My nephew  luv it!  Right size  for his little hands.\n \n  The balls have great colours, don't squish easy and are a decent size. \n  The size was perfect for my 1 and 3 year olds. The colors are bright. I am very pleased with my purchase.\n \n  Great toy for indoor tent & jumping area.\n \n  Bought these for my sons birthday.  He loves them! He's a 33lb kid & they're pretty durable. He hasn't crushed any yet! Definitely would recommend!\n \n  Combined with  ALPIKA Train Kids Pop Up Play Tent, Tunnel and Ball Pit with Storage Bag(Blue)\n ", "\n  Exactly what I was looking for. These are around medium size. They are crush proof. We haven't had any issues with these.\n \n  My grandson loved this I bought with tent\n \n  they do break and split  , ok, just watch closly\n \n  A bit overpriced for the quality, but baby liked it so it\u2019s worth it:)\n \n  This is my second time ordering this particular set. I ordered a ball pit but not enough balls so I knew I could trust this brand. They truly don't get bent or broken in any way.\n \n  Bought these to pair with the play tent! Havent used them yet. But everything looks great!\n \n  The package arrived here in decent time. The balls are a little thinner plastic than the balls in giant ball pens. They work fine for us. One person said 200 was enough to cover the bottom of a pack n play. Not quite but still fun\n \n  Got these for my dog, and he loved them. They are decently sturdy but if allowed to chew on them he would most likely break them. They are a little smaller than I had hoped but they do the job.\n \n  What entertainment for my grandson and what a work out for me!\n \n  we use them in our ball pit and they have held up really well.\n ", "\n  These are great! I purchased them to use in my toddler's blow up baby pool instead of water as a ball pit. She loved it so much that I purchased more for her birthday party and used a larger blow up pool for all the kids to play in. It was a big hit and several of the parents decided to take my idea. I like this brand of balls because they are very durable, but not hard. They don't ever crush like some other brands I have purchased.\n \n  The balls are a pain to clean up (they will get out of the pit) but our daughter has so much fun with them.\n \n  Soft plastic balls. Keeps my 11 months old busy.\n \n  I love to get in a \"ball fight\" with my four grandbabies\n \n  super fun in a mini enclosed trampoline\n \n  Fun! Got them for my dog to pay in the pen\n \n  Great!  My dogs haven't tried to eat them.  200 only fills half of a small ball pit though.  I had to order 2 bags to fill th bottom mildly.\n \n  Toddler likes playing with these, just wish they weren't so expensive so I could get more because 200 seems like a lot, but you really need more like 400 to make a decent ball pit.\n \n  You need twice this to fill our ball pit for the boys. 200 balls is it nearly as much as you think it would be\n \n  Fun for the kids in a kiddie pool. My sons loves you\n ", "\n  The writ up said they were crush proof balls, that is not true! it doesn't take very much pressure to flatten them flat. I would not recommend these to anyone even for children.\n \n  tantas pelota juntas en diferentes colore,,se ven  preciosas,,\n None \n  Bought these for my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves them!! They are very colorful, sturdy, and durable. She dives and jumps into ball pit and balls do not crush. Very pleased with this purchase.\n \n  exactly what we wanted, arrived on time and made my child happy for a low cost.\n \n  It was her favorite bday gift!!!\n \n  So my sister got these for my son, and I didn't think they would be crush prove. with having a big dog and all, our old set went by fast. But these are actually crush prove and my son loves them. His face just lite up when they arrived. the color is excellent,and they're a great size for a one year old. yes you should get these. worth the money\n \n  exactly what I wanted/needed - just felt it was a little pricey for what/how many you get.  To fill our 'pack n play' with enough balls to where my daughter wants/needs it, I'm going to have to buy a whole complete 2nd set.  Obviously starting to get pricey that way...\n \n  My son like to play with them, the case is great idea because easy way when you need to pick them up.\n \n  These were just perfect for my nephews ball pit. Our animals love them too!\n \n  Ball Pit needs balls \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc ", "\n  These are truly crushproof! My hubby got in the ball pit with our 1.5 yr olds and no balls damaged. My hubs is about 206lbs. The only thing that could be better is to be more vibrant, but not a big deal. Still a good product\n \n  Perfect size for small ball pit for toddler\n \n  grand-daughter loves playing in the balls.  she spends so much time playing in the balls.\n \n  I wish that the balls were a bit bigger.  We should have checked the size before ordering these, but ordered them quickly for Christmas and assumed they were the bigger size.  We ended up ordering another batch of 200 and it still looks like there are hardly any balls in the ball pit.  They serve their purpose and our child likes them.  That's all that matters.\n \n  my son enjoys them in his ball pit!\n \n  Balls are the perfect size, light weight and fun colors. But they squish pretty easily.\n \n  Not going to rate this. Ordered for a friend\n \n  These are great! My baby loves them so far. He\u2019s never seen a ball pit before but is having the time of his life with these! One bag fills a pack n play.\n \n  These are great. There are enough balls for a baby to play in a small kiddie pool. The balls hold their shape well. My one-year old hasn't crushed any (yet).\n \n  Not much can go wrong here. We received the balls in a timely manner. We did not count the balls but it was more than enough :) (parent speaking) We purchased this with the pop up children playhouse and we like it a lot.\n ", "\n  Got this with a giant princess tent thing and my niece gets so mad when she has to come out. This was the best Christmas present I could have got her.\n \n  Selected as Christmas gift for a 2 year old girl along with a Mudder Kids Ball Pit. Although she has not received the gift yet, I expect she will enjoy playing in the pit and spend countless hours throwing the soft plastic balls and then picking them up again.\n \n  Smaller than what I thought but beautiful and looks well made, I want to purchased 200 more !\n \n  Absolutely thin and pitiful. How can they even say crush-proof? Worthless.\n \n  These are advertised as \"crush proof,\" however they are very thin and crush easily. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money!\n \n  Would get all 5 stars but we were shorted balls. Only came with 180 balls. It was disappointing\n \n  Used to fulfill a place mate I bought for my grandkid.\n \n  Product is good. We filled our swimming pool with is and would probably need to buy at 600 balls for it to actually look like a play pen. A bit smaller size than expected but not small enough for the baby to fit in her mouth. Would buy again.\n \n  Used it for a small blow up bouncy. The only thing was 200 was not nearly enough to fill up the bottom and make a ball pit!\n \n  Great product, great service\n ", "\n  These are sturdy colorful balls that can be tossed in the tub or playpen as well as one of the fun tunnels. Great fun for young kids.\n \n  As advertised. Break proof. Very colorful. Perfect size for 18 -24 mo hands. One container covers floor small ball pit. Two bags would be better for older kids.\n \n  Bought these for an inflatable ball pit for my 1 year old daughter. They seem to be holding up well as she hasn't destroyed all of them yet.\n \n  Thanks to my teenager son for counting the balls. 200 balls accounted for. ;-)\n \n  Perfect compliment to the bounce house\n \n  Need more! Got this for my daughters 3 in 1 tent, but we need about 300 more to fill up the ball pit \ud83d\ude02\n \n  Love these. I use the for my 14yrs son's sensory ball pit.\n \n  I never leave a review, but I brought these balls for my nephew\u2019s birthday and It states it\u2019s 200 balls... More like 50. Don\u2019t waste your money\n \n  Nephew likes them, good amount. Not happy with the price of plastic balls but they seem to be crush proof for now.. Until they get a hole worked into them.\n \n  High quality. They don't crush in your hand even when I tried to, so I knew my 1 year old wouldn't be able to. I got these to put in my son's bounce house during his birthday party and they were a hit! Bonus that they came in a zippered mesh bag that I could reuse!\n ", "\n  The balls are smaller than expected but fine\n \n  cant go wrong for the price excellent\n \n  This bag of colorful balls is great! So many balls and so much fun to play with. You and your family will have a great time with this huge sack of balls!!\n \n  The Balls were soft and easy to clean\n \n  Very flimsy balls. They can be crushed with very little effort.\n \n  They aren\u2019t very durable at all, lol. But my son loved them, and it was a good price!\n \n  Love and the balls are nice and sturdy!\n \n  Love these! Found a little mushroom pool on clearance this past winter. Bought these balls to put in the pool, and it kept my toddler happy & squealing with delight in our living room. The balls are firm enough to hold their shape, but made of a flexible plastic so no injuries when jumping into them. I also like that they are solid, so no tiny openings to collect water, mildew, or other toddler debris.\n \n  If you own a big dog, these will get chewed up really easily unless you separate your dog from your kid's play space. I don't. Otherwise, they're just balls. They're good for kids.\n \n  I only purchased one of 200 balls to fill up the ball pit a little more\n ", "\n  I ordered two batches of 200 balls. The first batch was good but the second one the balls are deflated.\n \n  My son loves these, we actually have like 5 or 6 bags worth,it's fun to have them all over the place and jump into them, I'm like a big kid, but seriously, my son loves all these balls too.\n \n  Good value for the money\n \n  Great fun toy for kids. My son likes it and play it like playing basketball.\n \n  Exactly what we were looking for\n \n  The balls came in smelling really bad & alot of the balls came is with nasty greasy black tar it took me a very long time to clean it up even then it still smells after I cleaned and sanitized them.  It was very hard and sturdy.  Very sad about it .\n \n  For the quality I think I have to give five stars \u2b50\ufe0f but the quantity \u2014 200 seems a lot, but it\u2019s not a lot guys! You\u2019d need at least 20 (yes twenty) 200-pack bags to fill your kid\u2019s inflatable pool so he or she could play with balls comfortably\n \n  Gift grandson loves them\n \n  No smell, crush proof, and every ball was perfectly shaped. Colors look better in person.\n \n  My lil man loves this\n ", "\n  These are super cute but there were definitely not 200 balls. There was only 160. Yes someone actually counted.\n \n  Great product but missing some balls from the pack.\n \n  Worked out perfect for what I needed them for. The balls were a little smaller than I expected but still worked out perfect.\n \n  The pit balls are amazing with color and don't dent or fade!! Kids love to play with them.\n \n  We made a mini-ball pit in a playpen and in a blow up pool. The balls are brightly colored, and my daughter loves the noise they make when they move around. I'm so glad they go back into their mesh bags very easily, which is great for storage between playing. They are easy to rinse off and if they get really dirty, one could simply place a few at a time in laundry bags and run them on delicate in the washing machine. We've done that successfully a few times. If you have a front loading washing machine you could probably just throw them in there by themselves and wash them as the tumbling motion will get them clean and they don't have to be weighted down in a bag. We are going to set up a mini ball pit at her birthday for the kids too\n \n  Balls are pretty sturdy, but we did not receive the full 200 balls!!\n \n  Daughter loves these\n \n  Great for the ball pit I put together and the perfect amount.\n \n  The quality of these balls was great but I was surprised by the size. They are small and was told they would fill the mesh ball pit fine and they didn't even come close.  I bought 500 from another vendor and they still only fill the pit halfway.\n \n  All 200 (I counted) balls arrived uncrushed. Perfect size. Recommend purchasing 400 if you are trying to fill a larger playpen.\n ", "\n  Colorful and durable, fun to play with!\n \n  I love these balls.\n \n  Good fun play balls\n \n  Must have for ball pits\n \n  Colors are bright. Balls are sturdier than expected, but also smaller than expected. Will definitely need more than one order of these for the ball pit and tent we got our daughter. Great quality though!\n \n  I'm extremely happy with these balls.  The colors are cheerful and remind me of gumballs! They are lighter and softer than commercial pit balls (they have a little give if you squish them) so they are safe for kids to throw around your home, yet they are definitely crush-proof as advertised. My toddler has stepped, sat, and chewed on them without causing any permanent damage to a single one.  I ordered a package of 100 and 200.  I counted the package of 100 and they were all there. Each ball is marked \"China\".  They have no CE mark. These balls do not have a funky plastic smell, so I'm sort of just trusting the claim that they are phthalate free. \n  GREAT purchase! Perfect to fill a small ball pit. Durable and a great size. Will recommend to further buyers!\n \n  Excellent product, I still think they are overpriced for a bag of plastic balls. But they do hold their shape well.\n \n  Bought these with the FocuSun Playpen Ball Pit. Purchased them at Christmas for my nephew who is just under two. It's his favorite toy. The balls are durable and small enough he can fit them in his hand but not in his mouth. I recommend that you purchase two of these if you buy the same ball pit pen, but they're great.\n \n  Wayyy too tiny. I thought these were standard size.\n ", "\n  Good quality. Soft, but dont get impacted easy or lose spherical shape.\n \n  Not 200 balls.. I'm disappointed on the amount that I have and for the price it just didn't add up ..I was expecting another box but I didn't I rather it be get 100+ balls verses saying 200 and barely getting the balls to 150 ..that's false advertising\n \n  Excellent product\n \n  They are exactly what they say they are. A bag of balls!\n \n  They\u2019re what I wanted in a way. They\u2019re slightly smaller than I thought they would be but they\u2019ll do for now.\n \n  The reason for the 4 stars is because even though this is 200 pieces it really didn't dream like a lot at all in the pen. I would have had to buy a 1,000 I think to go for what I was wanting to achieve for a ball pit.\n \n  I used these for a puppy pool and boy did they have fun!\n \n  The balls are kinda hard. So my babies don\u2019t like them.\n \n  We\u2019ve had ours for a week now and not a single issue.  Both of my boys (1 yr and 5 yrs) love them.

Spent a lot of time hiding under the balls, throwing them all over the room , then retrieving them and put them back in the tote, hiding toys and digging them out. \n  They are perfect for what we needed.

Big enough to take up a good amount of room in a ball pit, but small enough for a toddler to grab\n \n  Great product\n \n  Balls are about the same size as the ones in our ball pit. Kind of wish I would of bought the 300 pack instead but 200 is good. They aren't too hard and not too soft..\n \n  This set of \"200\" balls only came with 117 balls. Definitely a rip off and false advertising!!\n \n  I love these. They\u2019re perfect for my little dog.\n \n  The balls are sturdy.

My boys love to play with them, throwing, tossing and rolling on them. \n  As advertised. My kid plays with these everyday in some form or fashion.\n \n  It\u2019s as expected but the reality is that it\u2019s a lot of pieces for a parent to pick up every time it\u2019s played with. The bounce house without the balls is fun enough!\n \n  perfect size balls for the pin/inclosure. Not to small to get chocked on and not to large to grip.

If you\u2019re buying these to fill a pool or something you\u2019ll definitely need 2-3 packs.\n \n  My twin grandbabies play with these in a ball pit.\n \n  I purchased these to go along with a play tent.  These balls are smaller than I had imagined and I will need more of them but they are soft and pliable for my daughter to use and grasp, I'm not nervous about her getting hurt in case she gets hit with one.

Easy to wash.\n \n  Ordered for my nephew, he had them almost all smashed in 30 mins of just jumping in them and hes 4 and weighs nothing....\n \n  Nice product. Was expecting the balls to be hard plastic but they were softer which is better/safer. I got 200 and it wasn\u2019t really enough for a pack n play in my opinion. I ordered 400 more.\n \n  Satisfied\n \n  Was a terrific addition to the blow up bouncing device.\n \n  I have a niece and nephew born 1 day apart.  Wanted to get them both something fun for their 2 year bday.  So I got both of them a ball pit.

However, his puppy can crush them in its mouth.\n \n  Based on reviews that said 200 would be enough balls for the pack n play, I bought this. However, there was no need! The box they came in was even better!\n \n  Received mine fine, no crushed balls (not even the yellow ones) and I've already washed them, packed them back in the bag and dried hem and they're all still round.\n \n  The balls are the perfect size, very sturdy and they arrived VERY quickly!! Very pleased with this product, although they're definitely pricey.  Wouldn't want to skimp and get cheap plastic balls that would immediately be crushed.\n \n  Great balls but it\u2019s a lil addicting. I first ordered a pack of 50.

I like that they are BPA free too since he is constantly putting them in his mouth.\n \n  Love these. Kids love them. Holding up to the abuse so far. No weird smells or anything.\n \n  The balls are slightly smaller than others I have purchased. If I had known this I would have just spent a little more money and bought 2 bags of 100 of the brand I bought previously. Thought I was getting a good deal, but because they are smaller in size I will have to buy more to fill my ball pit.\n \n  I got 400 balls. They cost a little more then some of the other ones but you can see why. They really are crush proof and they're a good size. And they're impervious to baby teeth lol. I disinfect them all in a bucket of water with a bit of bleach and dryed them with a clean towel btw.\n \n  My 1 and 3 year old children love playing in the ball pit with these!  Fairly sturdy, unless the dog gets a hold of them.  :-)\n \n  Plastic a little thin but otherwise as advertised.\n \n  The look on my two year old granddaughter was priceless.\n \n  These are so much better than the other bag I bought.

They need to lower the price.. not worth the money.\n \n  Great product and well worth the money. I would not recommend buying less than 200 balls however because they are a little small if you are using them to fill a ball pit...\n \n  These balls were easily smashed by my 1 year old grandson just by getting in the ball pit.

Really sturdy and a nice size for little hands to pick up and play with. My only gripe is that they come in a mesh bag for storage which would have been really nice except the mesh bag had 6 holes in, rendering it totally useless.\n \n  Very durable. They don't crush very easily. There's a variety of colors. But they're fairly expensive for being a hollow plastic ball.\n \n  Loved these! Prefect size for my little guys ball pit. If only they were a littl cheaper. 200 did not cover much in my son's little ball pit, so I had to order another 400 more. It's expensive but worth it.

They have no chemical smell, which is great for a concerned mom. My husband has sat on a few and they have yet to puncture or deflate in any way - one of my main concerns. The colors are fantastic - really bright. The bag looks sturdy enough for the time being. It is a bit flimsy, which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.

Better quality than the target and walmart balls.\n \n  Kids love these but they seem to be rather expensive for the amount you get.\n \n  My lil one loves these balls especially the red balls. He is very fond of them. I'm very happy that i chose click N play. The balls are very good. The package arrived on time and there were exactly 200 balls. Would recommend to buy.

Would recommend a larger order for medium to large pits.\n \n  MY KIDS LOVE IT WOULD BUY AGAIN\n \n  My kids immediately took to them as soon as the package came.  Great buy but reccomend 2 packs if you are purchasing for a ball pit.\n \n  Our two year old loves to play with these and almost all the kids who come over love these as well\n \n  We have some other balls from tunel set which are too soft, but this set is much better quality, looks shiny and attractive and kid has fun playing with them.\n ", "\n  These are great size.  Great quality and just what we needed....\n \n  My kids love this\n \n  I would not call these crush free.  But makes for a fun ball pit.\n \n  Strong, nice, great color!\n \n  Fast shipping looks just like the pick. Ordered 2 to completely fill his ball pit,came in large box, very light weight\n \n  The quality was 1000% better than I thought they'd be. Totally worth every penny\n \n  they where fun but they claimed they're crush proof and they are far from they crush very easily.\n \n  Look and feel as expected. Good quality\n \n  An excellent product!!!! \n  Smaller than I expected. I was trying to fill up a sand turtle and I ended up having to buy more balls. Not worth the price to me.\n ", "\n  My 13mo loves to play in her ball pit ... balls are comfortable for her to hold and light. Sturdy enough so she can\u2019t crush, bite or chew!\n \n  Added to ball pit fit lots of fun\n \n  SO many! very colorful. durable and good quality.\n \n  good quality !!\n \n  These balls are surprisingly durable. My 1 year old sits on them in the ball pit and the dents pop right back out. Buying more.\n \n  Product as described. Arrived within Amazon's 2 day Prime shipping. My son (7 months) loves them. I tried to squeeze one and they really are not able to be crushed. Great product, would recommend to anyone.\n \n  bought this as a gift the kids absolutely loved them\n \n  It was perfect for the ball pit we purchased! It filled the entire pit with a layer of balls, not too much and not too little. These are also perfect size for my 1 year olds hands and she loves throwing them every where!\n \n  Perfect size. Baby plays HARD with them and none have crushed (except the ones the dog got)\n \n  My baby enjoyed a lot\n ", "\n  balls and balls......but my son only wanted to play with the box....\n \n  i count all the balls, there's only 85!! how is this even legal. not worth the money!!\n \n  They\u2019re great\n \n  Good size and quantity but the mesh bag came with a hole in it. Not going to bother returning it because I got it as a christmas gift and the new one likely wouldn't arrive in time for Christmas. But all in all, the balls are decent, bag is not the most durable.\n \n  Great item my little nephew loved it!!\n \n  The original balls that the playhouse came with did not stand up to the quality of these! They are durable and withstand any attack from a 2-3 year old. The added bag to wash them is very helpful. I will be buying more once my toddler learns how to hide things!\n \n  My son loves them . Dog does to lol\n \n  My son like them\n \n  The balls are as described, with nice colors. We liked them so much, we ordered 200 more for the ballpit.\n \n  These are great. I will let you know that 200 balls don't go very far. I bought two bags (400 balls) to fill up a small inflatable pool, but it's still not enough, I just ordered another bag today.

There were six bright colors, but no purple.\n \n  Love these balls- they are the largest I've been able to find.  Took about 600 to fill our pit.\n \n  At first she was scared and now she is like.

Very sturdy, won't smush. Have held up well to several months of rough play.\n \n  I'm very happy with this purchase! They're surdy and colorful and my son enjoys playing with them. They're small so its easier for him to grasp but they didn't fill the pit I bought so I got another order to go with them. I've stepped on one and dented it but it was a quick and easy fix with no markings on it, which is awesome! Excited to get the next order in :)\n \n  For ball pit\n \n  Bought these to go along with a ball pit and they fit the bill.\n \n  Great product. was amazed by what 30$ can buy you. Dog loved it.\n \n  Arrived on time. Product is exactly what you see. Very good. Kids haven't played with them yet, but so far so good. Tried to sqeeze one to check how well they are made & no dents.

Very clean.\n \n  Lots of Balls\n \n  Very happy with this! 200 ball all in great shape and fun colors for the kids and match the ones we had.\n \n  too expensive\n \n  I reccomend buying 2 bags of these (1 bag isnt enough) and a container to store these.\n ", "\n  Perfect to fill toy tents for our son's bday this weekend. They are a thin plastic but our boys have yet to dent them (ages 5, 3 and 2). I like that they are a thinner plastic so as they throw them, no one is getting hurt and nothing is getting broken. We ordered two 200 ball packs. They come in the mess bag as pictured. I did count them after seeing bad reviews about there not being 200. We had 200 in one bag and 208 in the other. So I would say count them as soon as you get them and contact the seller if you've been shorted on what you ordered. They came VERY quickly (4 days after placing order). Will be ordering these again if we decided we need more. Great value for the price and fast shipping.\n \n  The balls are not 2.5 inches.  They are smaller than all other ball pit balls we have gotten that are 2.5 inches. \n  Perfect for the fur babies\n \n  Just what we needed\n \n  a nice item for young people. My grandson loves them.

Not too soft to where it would make dents but not too hard to where they hurt.\n \n  Perfect will be ordering more!\n \n  Great product very sturdy my little one loves them.\n \n  They are great, strong and colorful. 200 balls aren't that many unfortunately.

Turns out, it is maybe less than 0.25inches bigger than the other ones. These are still pretty small. Smaller compared to another brand that is bigger and cheaper and still BPA, Phthalate free. Disappointed in my purchase.\n \n  Granddaughter Love this ball\n \n  I got these as a filler for a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse ball pit I got for my sixteen-month-old niece, as it only came with 20 balls. These were slightly smaller in diameter, but are actually easier for her to handle and direct through the holes on the side of the pit. They are colorful, soft, and well-constructed.\n \n  Must add at least 3 of these to the playhouse jungle gym sets and it is all day fun.\n \n  fun balls to go in the play tents....teaches kids to pick up after themselves at an early age!\n \n  I like the idea that my great grandson can safely play with these balls & I don't have to worry about his being harmed by chemicals after putting them in his mouth. The down side to these balls are that I am constantly picking them up! Ha ha!\n \n  These are great balls,they don't pop. Only thing is I wish they were a little bigger\n \n  These balls are perfect! The colors are bright, the size are perfect for little ones to grab, and the quality is great- not too hard nor too soft! Love them!\n \n  Returned. Didn't need it\n \n  Great Product.\n ", "\n  Great\n \n  These are good quality and hold up well to several 4 year old kids playing with them.  However, I'm very disappointed at the poor quality control.  I ordered two packs of 200 balls.  Between the two packs, I was missing 30 balls!  They were for a party so I didn't have time to return them but sure wish I had received what I paid for.\n \n  Great for Ball Pit.  Kids played with these at Grandon's 1st Birthday Party.  Kids didn't want to go home.\n \n  Great\n \n  Bought these for the life size Kerplunk game that I made with my granddaughters.

Daughter loves them, quality is good, have not had any dent or crush after about a month.\n \n  Wonderful addition to another toy....\n \n  My kids love them!\n \n  This set has worked out perfectly for us! We purchased 200 of these balls. It adequately fills up a ball pit measuring 2 feet 8 inches squared. The balls are the perfect size and they are a bit flexible to the touch which I actually want. I have an 11 month old son that will be playing in it so I don't want the balls to be really hard. He won't be doing stage dives into this ball pit so these are fine just the way they are. I also like that the set comes with an even distribution of colors. The mesh storage bag is handy to have when the balls are not in use. We are very pleased with this purchase and will be getting more for our other bigger ball pit\n \n  like the colors and the quality\n ", "\n  So 200 balls goes nowhere in a ball pit....just ordered two more sets...hope 600 makes a dent in his pop up ball pit \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n \n  I read a lot of the reviews and some kind of made me not want to buy... but when they came in they were great!

They are ok for my kids but if my dog tries to steal one, it is crushed instantly. So I would say kid friendly but not dog friendly (yes, people do buy play balls for dogs).\n \n  I knew these weren't the larger balls, but they were still a little smaller than I expected.  Great quality though!  If you don't mind the size, then these are a great choice!\n \n  All the balls arrived in good condition and they are sturdy. I used it for the pack and play and it covered all of it. Fun for the kids.\n \n  These balls are great! You seriously cannot crush them at all!

They are soft, but I dodnt have any issues with them bending.\n \n  The balls do not seem to crush so far. We ordered the 200 pack but it only came with 100 balls. It may not be worth the money for only 100 balls, otherwise they seem like good quality balls.\n \n  The balls are quite a bit smaller than I was expecting but are still nice.\n \n  Great price for the number of balls. Sturdy for the product. Not to hard and not soft and flimsy.

Ordered the 800 pack twice. Love em. Some came a little discolored but honestly don\u2019t care. Can\u2019t tell when they are all mixed up. My kids and their friends have played and jumped all in the ball pit. No balls have been squished flattened or damaged. This works perfectly. Awesome color variety. Recommended\n \n  I wrote to Amazon immediately after purchase regarding the balls having shards of glass, rice and dirt in the balls. We used them for our daughters first birthday and filled a brand new inflatable pool up and put them in. The pool was new and clean, especially since we had to blow it up. No one responded from Amazon and it was very dangerous for a baby to play. Luckily my other daughter felt in the balls Abe was able to feel all the debris! We threw them away. Wasted money and could have risked babies being hurt!\n \n  These pit balls are great! \n  Added these to some 2.5\" balls we already had. Adds a lot more color to the mix! With a digital caliper they measure at 2.4\" diameter, but you really can't tell the difference between these and 2.5\" balls when they're all together. Your kids won't either. Excellent value.\n \n  IF YOU ARE COMPARISON SHOPPING FOR A BIG SET OF BALLS, STOP & BUY THIS ONE, ITS THE BEST SET OF BALLS ON THE MARKET. \n  Counted them all, and it was 5 balls short.  When you say 200 balls, there should be at least 200 not 5 short.  I'm sure that most people don't count, so they figure, hey, we'll rip off enough people, and every 40 customers we rip off we gain another 200 balls! \n  Previously I'd ordered this product and it was short balls. I returned them and asked for a replacement to see if the company had done it on purpose... the replacement came in a circular mesh bag instead of a rectangular mesh bag and it was exactly 400 balls as advertised and as I'd purchased. \n  I bought these to use in a 4 ft diameter pop up ball pit for my 6 month old and these were perfect for that use. 400 balls fill up about 1/3 of the pit, so if you want deeper than you'll need to order more. There is a little give to them if they are squeezed or sat on but so far we haven't had problems with them tearing and they pop back into shape fine. I saved the mesh bag they came in so that I can put the balls back in for storage and to run through the washing machine; I just use cold water cycle only and let them air dry (very quick to dry) and they hold up fine! For the price and quantity this was a great value buy and I would purchase again.\n \n  These balls are not 2.5 inches as stated, they arw small than that for sure! I mixed them with another bag I got that stated those were 2.5 in and the ones that came in this bag is noticeable smaller! Probably 2 inches. I will be returning them, which sucks because it took FOREVER for them to even get here!\n \n  The balls arrived in perfect condition, none are dented, they look and smell clean, we are happy with the balls. However, both mesh bags the balls arrived in, arrived with tears in them big enough for balls to fall out.  Also, I paid for 1 day shipping and ended up receiving the items in 3 days with a couple other products I ordered from Amazon.  Luckily, they arrived in time for my nephew's birthday. ", "\n  Pros- The balls are a decent value, I calculated around 7 cent each for the 800 count. Also, the colors are bright. The balls are pretty sturdy too; I laid on them and none were crushed. I\u2019m sure my 3 kids- ages 8, 5, and 3- will enjoy playing with them. I would have given them 4 or 5 stars if not for the following issue. \n  We have a new granddaughter that we babysit twice a week.  I'd bought a mesh ball pit to put her playmat/baby gym in to keep our dogs from messing with it, and once she outgrew the baby gym and started to sit up, I decided to fill it with balls.  These turned out perfect.  There was just the right amount to fill the pit to a reasonable level, and they're well-made.  Best, of course, is that the granddaughter loves them!\n \n  This are a GREAT quality, vibrant and nice color set of balls! I had this one my shopping cart for 2 weeks deciding if to get them or not. I REGRET not getting them earlier as I lost the change to get the 800 count for $47-$50 (which is the BEST deal in the whole Amazon! Trust me I did my research) \n  I had bought a small inflatable ball pit that came with a small amount of balls. A young grand daughter promptly burst the inflatable, but really seemed to enjoy the sensory element of the balls. I bought 1 pkg of this brand and put the balls inside a plastic child fencing instead of buying an inflatable or a folding mesh that might become harmful when the wires became exposed. These balls are superior (stronger) to the ones that came with the inflatable, but clearly, one set was not going to be enough. I ordered 2 more sets. They work very well, holding up with the younger grands and older ones, even adults sitting amongst them. The mesh bags that the balls come in are very good for storing them. I kept the shipping boxes, as well, so they will stack when being stored.\n \n  I already have some play balls 2.5\u201d size \n  I have ordered a smaller quantity of these balls before, and my grandkids loved them, although a quantity of 100 was just not enough. This time I ordered 400, but although I was given a delivery date, it was changed and updated numerous times and I finally had to re-order.  I was given a delivery date for a future week, but then a few days later I received notice that the order was on its way and the next day after that they arrived. Not sure what is going on here, but it was described as an Amazon.com product. Oh well, now the kids are swimming in balls. They do not hold up well to deliberate squashing, but sometimes that is just part of the fun.\n \n  I purchased these pit balls to go in a ball pit tent, for my LO. My LO will be getting this at Christmas, but I can tell you that you cannot beat this price! It's going to take a lot of pit balls to make the ball pit area look even remotely full, and I may end up having to order more of these once I can actually put them inside the tent. These pit balls are sturdy for a LO only (my 8 year old would crush them if she sit in the pit), colorful, seem to be incredibly durable, and like I've already mentioned you can't beat the price. I highly recommend these pit balls for your LO! I think this is very giftable, as LO's love pit balls! I know my LO is going to enjoy these.\n \n  These colorful playballs are FANTASTIC! When our 22-month old granddaughter arrived to the house, it was the first thing she saw when she came around the corner. BALLS! she yelled. We put them in her blow-up jumper and she had a blast. The only thing Grampy didn't do was to order enough balls. The 400-count was going to take twice as long to get here so I just went with the 200 balls. Not nearly enough for the jumper. So, I will gladly order more. They are great balls, great colors, well packaged, and the zippered mess bag is fantastic. Even using the balls to help teach colors. This was a huge hit all around!!\n None None None \n  \u00a0We purchased a ball pit for our sons 1st birthday, and purchased 400 of these balls to \"fill\" it. The balls have vibrant colors, and are safe enough for him to put his mouth on and play in by himself. The balls are not hard, which is a blessing and a curse at the same time; they will last long enough to get some good play time out of, but if you want \"long term use\" I would recommend a different brand that specifically states something regarding their \"durability\". But hey, kids will be kids, so how much \"long term use\" can you really expect from anything. Over all, I would recommend these to a friend.\n \n  First off let me say these balls are very durable and a ton of fun for any kid! My kids love them so much I ordered 2 more 800 packs (Delivery date to be determined ) but I just wish they would have stated the actual count of the balls. I bought a 400 pack but only received about 359 ball. It\u2019s still a good price for them , I just like honestly when buying a product, oh the number listed on customer service is forward to voice mail immediately. I\u2019m a little worried how many will be missing when I receive the (2)800 count ones.  :/ but , I would , and have bought again just because these balls seriously don\u2019t crush even with an adults weight.\n ", "\n  I did not get the full count of balls. Is there a way to report this? I like the color of the balls and how durable they are so far. They are a bit smaller and if I can buy a 1st set again I'll probably buy balls that are 4 inch in diameter. Although, if they were bigger, toddlers might not be able to hold them easily (good thing if you don't want your toddler throwing the balls around too much). However, bigger balls fill a bin faster and easier. I bought this for my niece and since she loved them so much I didn't return them after opening them. Unfortunately, companies that make toddler toys seem to get away with alot of things (like missing balls) due to parents workload and stress levels...who would bother to count a set of plastic balls? Me...an aunt who has no children, time on her hand, and cares about quality & quantity for her niece. \ud83d\ude02 Please do better with customer service & product integrity. Thank you.\n \n  These ball pit balls were purchased for my 18 mo old goddaughters playroom in my home. I had one set of ball pit balls already but not even close to enough to fill the pool I got on Amazon for the \u201cball pit\u201d (Intex pool). Note in the photo there is 100-200 balls mixed in of the set I already had, primary colors. Well, 400-600 balls later and I love our ball pit, and most importantly so does she! She has been in absolute bliss since I set it up! I searched and searched and these were definitely the best value. They also have held up to me, a 135lb woman getting in and playing with her. :) I am so happy I decided on this set and actually prefer this collection of colors compared to the ones I already had. They are so fresh and happy looking and mesh well with the rest of our little playroom and brighten everything up. They arrived quickly, safely boxed and came in a reusable mesh zip up bag for storage. You can\u2019t go wrong with this deal for your little ones, stock up!\n \n  Our 9mo. old wasn't a fan the first time we put him in the ball pit but the second time he liked it a little more; I'm sure he'll warmed up to it. The neighbor kid (16 mo. old) loved it. He jumped right in and swam and kicked and threw balls and hid himself under balls - he gets it. \n  The amount of balls you receive for the low price is amazing in itself. The colors aren't those neon type ones - they are deep in the color tone but still bright. I compared and researched all major retailers ( Walmart, Target, Sams Club, Costco, BJs, Five Below, Big Lots, etc.) Not one provided the amount i needed at such an affordable price point. The ability to purchase it on Amazon with the most amazing Prime shipping - helped win me over even more. I will definitely be making this seller my primary source for the ball pit balls and you should too. They so durable that a teething baby/toddler can't destroy it but gentle enough that it is soothing for them. My kids loved getting these to play with. During this pandemic, we had to get real creative on how to entertain our children while keeping them safe. Super grateful for the product - Affordable, Value, Quality, and Amazing customer service. No one can compete with them. Thank you again BalanceForm Llc you saved my wallet and my kids day.\n \n  These are great! For being a soft plastic shaped into ball form they actually are quite durable. \n  pay the extra money to get the better quality balls.  these balls come in faded colors and are not nearly as vibrant or sturdy as other brands.  they also took 3 months to ship to the united states, so total waste of time\n \n  the balls showed up super quick. unfortunately the ball pit i ordered got lost in the mail, so we're still waiting on those, but the box the balls came in was big enough for my 3yo so she didn't mind jumping in and making the best of it. There are at least 6 different colors, so it not only helps my daughter keep entertained, but we also use it to identify colors, we can count balls and also make games like bounce on the back of the box, or straight in, or bounce in the font and back. if you need something for a kid to be entertained, this is it. one word of caution though, 400 is a lot of balls so when they start throwing them all over the place, then you'll spend some time picking them all up. the white sheer bag makes it easy to pack and store. highly recommended!\n \n  Well their as expected can't complain. Bought these for my 1 year old. What I have to compare them to? Bright Starts balls that we first got (about 30) with one of his play mats. These are made by a company calledBalanceForm and are produced in China. They also offer a 2 year warranty (from the production date). I received mine about 4 months after the production date. Compared to the Bright Starts, these seem to be the exact same size. The plastic on it appears more translucent, but the balls feel alot firmer than the Bright Starts. The don't compress as easily and so far pop back to it's round shape each time. Can't say the same for the Bright Starts, as I have to pop the back to shape. Firmer or softer balls is a personal preference. Personally I like them, they feel more durable even though the plastic appears more translucent. The seam on it is more pronounced, you can definitely feel them and it's raised, so the finish on that is kind is rough. Besides the seam, the finish on it is glossy and smooth. The reds and yellow are deep and rich shade, however the blue is a much lighter, faded shade. As for the price, Pretty good for 800 count. I'm happy when the purchase and highly recommend it, unless you are looking for a certain shade of color (really didn't matter to me) how how firm you want the balls, there are more towards the firm size. 5 stars for quality and value.\n \n  Item was delivered before scheduled ETA. Packaging was simple, and undamaged. We have purchased a 2 different sets from 2 different sellers on Amazon. Those items were inconsistent with the description and a lot smaller to be used in a ball pit. This was also the best priced item that we could find for the amount of balls. We paid the same amount for 200 balls, and close to the same amount for 100 prior to this purchase. $29.99 is a great price for 400 balls, especially considering other prices. 400 balls was enough to complete the ball pit for our 18 month old son. We got rid of the older balls and replaced them with the 400 and its filled nicely. We're very happy, and our son is even more happy. \n  I am very disappointed.  We orderer from this seller once, we counted the balls and it came with 375 balls, not 400 as it says. But, because I loved the \"Tiffany blue\" color, and I count it fast, I thought I may have counted it faster and wrong,  so because of the colors, I ordered it again. This time, the valls came in a different net bag, they were way thinner, kind of see trough as I tried to show in the pictures and guess what? No \"Tiffany blue\" color. So I decide to count it and for my surprise it came with 402 balls. I should be happy but it just show that there is something off here and the first time I probably count it right. The quality is not good and the colors are not as the picture shows, so I'm very disappointed.\n ", "\n  We used these inside a tunnel tent play structure and my daughter loves them. I tried testing them to see if they are really crush-proof and they truly are...they just bounce right back! I thought they would be a little bigger (like the kind at a play gym) but I think those are the 3\" balls. These are 2.3\" inches. Still, they are bigger than the competitors at 2.1\" and I'm finding the smaller size is actually better for my 9-month old since she can pick them up and they're easier to crawl through. I also like that they don't have the company name imprinted on each ball like some competitors (I think it's really weird for instance to have every one say \"My Balls\" on it!) Overall very happy with my purchase.\n \n  Our balls arrived quickly and as expected. The colors were as listed - bright and colorful, size seems as listed, and I didn't count them but seemed around 400. They arrived in a large white mesh bag. The balls worked perfectly for our 2' x 4' mini ballpit at the end of a Pikler Triangle slide set up. My 20 month old kept saying \"ball pit!\" and was very excited. \n  I chose these because they checked off my requirements and offered the best deal. \n  So I purchased 400 of these. I places them in my sons ball pit and there\u2019s definitely not 400. They hold up very well. They don\u2019t bend they\u2019re decent size for my 8 month old to be able to hold. If I wasn\u2019t so lazy I would actually count the balls. But I can definitely say there is not 400.\n \n  Got these balls for 4 kids stuck at home during COVID. 400 balls just fill a small plastic wading pool. Despite reviews stating that these balls were pretty sturdy, I didn't expect them to stand up to several wild toddlers (ages 5 and down). Surprisingly, after a whole week of the kids 'diving' into the pool only one ball was partially crushed. The balls are a bit smaller than the ones found in most play area ball pits which probably makes them a bit more crush-proof and also allows my 10-month-old to get a good grip on them while playing. I (and my kids:) would definitely get more of these if not for the thought of 1,000 balls scattered throughout the house \ud83d\ude31\n \n  I could have purchased 2 1/4 inch balls off ebay for cheaper, but I wanted the larger 2.5\" balls. Not happy.\n \n  Since we cannot take the kid out because of Covid, we have to find something to consume his energy and this set of playball is so much fun! We ordered the 400 pack and pour them into the pack n' play after cleaning and my boy had a blast. He was laughing and excited when we \"threw\" him in and trying to stand and crawling. The quality of these playballs are good, light, soft and sturdy. My boy bites them hard and none was broken. The size is big enough so we won't worry about him swallowing it accidentally. 400 balls are just about enough for the pack n' play but I wouldn't mind getting more since he really likes it. Will definitely recommend this product to those who have a crazy active \"monster\" at home lol.\n \n  Great product! I didn't think you could find a ball for ball pits that couldn't be crushed, but these have held up great for us for 2 months now! I've stepped on them, I've crushed them with my hand, and they go right back to their shape, not a wrinkle in them. They are small, they're accurate to the measurements stated but you realize 2.3\" is not that big when it's in front of you. That being said, the 400 ball pack is the perfect amount for our 16 month old. We currently have them sitting in a pack n play for her and when she's sitting in there it's the perfect amount for her. A few layers deep for fun, but not so deep that it might scare her.\n \n  These balls are perhaps a little smaller than you might be envisioning for a ball pit, but they're a perfect size for a toddler. The package of 400 filled a 4-ft diameter inflatable baby pool perfectly (the Intex Royal Castle Baby Pool, which also happens to be a perfect match color-wise!). They are a nice texture, soft and flexible but not crushable. Awesome value.\n \n  I ordered the 800 ball set and am very pleased with what I received.  I was concerned because previous reviews mentioned getting two mesh bags for the 800 ball order, however after some quick math (I weighed a ball and multiplied by 800 and to double check that I counted one color of the balls and multiplied by 6) I was able to determine that there were approx. 800 balls in the 1 mesh bag. ", "\n  Not right amount of balls\n \n  Product was what we expected for our little one. We used them to put into a ball pit for our 1.5 year old to play in. They are small enough for him to grab onto and throw; about the size of a a plum. \n  I bought the 800 balls package and I am pleased. I inspected them upon arrival looking for any defective unit and from these 800 balls, one was damaged and posed some degree of danger as had more or less sharp edges. The other had malformation but was not a danger for the kiddo. I threw the whole package in a regular size crib and I have attached some pictures. I made measurement with caliper and diameter is 2.3\u201d, please look at the pictures. I think is a great value for the money. Product arrived in a dirty box but balls were clean inside a plastic bag.\n \n  Purchased for use in small child's ball pit.  Diameter of pit is 39 in and 18 inches tall - 400 covered almost 1/3 of the pit.  My 2 year old grandson can almost completely cover himself.  I am purchasing an additional 200 to give him more coverage he likes to burrow like a mole.  Endless enjoyment- had to physically remove him from the pit for naptime.\n \n  Got a bunch of balls for my sons 2nd bday / party. These looks really nice but a few things to note... 1) you\u2019ll need way more balls than you think. We ended up with 1600 in a deeper kiddie pool and could actually have gone with one more bag 2) the actual balls are a bit smaller than I expected but really pretty colors 3) they squish a little bit more than I would like\u2014 have thrown a couple away\u2014 but that\u2019s more if the \u201cbig kids\u201d aka adults go in the ball pit. They are fine for toddlers! \n  Thank you for bringing me back to my childhood! I purchased two sets of these! Not only did I use them indoors in a ball pit, but I put them in our trampoline for extra fun!!! This is what made me do the second purchase, they supported my body\u2019s weight effortlessly... slide across them as if I was on a slip & slide! Use with caution if more than two people are enjoying * price is amazing for the amount of fun we got from them already. Is two bags enough \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude02  Fantastic Buy!!! Next day shipping for my area which came as a surprise both shipments.\n \n  These balls were in a ball pit for my 5# mini poodle who loves to run through a pile of balls. His little 5# weight was starting to crush them. We sent them back...still looking for ones that are sturdier.\n \n  I was so excited not to have to find some way to store these balls - the bag is perfect for both storing and even washing these balls. \n  These are perfect for my 11 month old. I thought they were going to be a little bit bigger, but still not disappointed. Beautiful colors, seemed to be of nice sturdy quality, not too flimsy. I will say though, we counted these balls twice and we are missing THREE WHOLE BALLS! Unacceptable lol \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 - I was glad only 3 were missing and not many more like other comments. I will update my comment in a couple months with the durability and how they hold up once we get some good play time in them.\n \n  My 18-month-old loves these things. So much so that \"ball\" was one of his first words. We took his pack and play and set it up in his room and filled it with these. He tosses them around and throws them out, giggling the whole time. I've caught him chewing on them a few times and he hasn't been able to do any damage before we got him to stop. Have every intention of keeping these around as a ball pit (and looking into expanding my collect) so long as he continues to enjoy.\n ", "\n  Balls are not cheap, but these were a better deal for the quantity that weren't cheap quality. I purchased 800 balls, they came in a big mesh bag that zips up for storage. I put them all into a pool I also purchased on Amazon. I'm glad I went with 800, its filled wonderfully. The colors are vibrant. Only one ball, that I can tell, was slightly smushed upon arrival. My baby girl is 7 months and she can hold the balls in one hand! Definitely a happy customer!\n \n  I had done quite a bit of shopping around for good quality pit balls for the price, and happened upon the 400pcs here. The price was great, they were delivered on time for a Halloween party for my toddler, and the colors are vibrant and more fun than traditional ball pit balls. I poured the whole bag into an Evenflow playpen, and at first glance, I thought, \"There's no way there's 400 there.\" I counted them just for the sake of it as I put them away, and sure enough, there were 400! They're durable but also soft, and were a huge hit with the little kids. I'll definitely be buying more!\n \n  We love these ball pit balls!!!! My 13 year old has jumped in the ball pit and they haven't flattened. They are well made. \n  I searched around until I finally decided on buying these balls for our ball pit and I'm very happy I ended up choosing these! They are very consistently colorful and an ideal size for small toddler hands. They also seem very durable because I personally tried crushing one and it withheld it's shape.  I'm building a 4'W, 5'L and 2.5'D ball pit and ended up ordering 2000 balls in total since these run on the smaller side but they are priced perfectly! I'll try to upload a picture once everything is constructed.\n \n  I had gotten my son a ball pit that came with 20 balls, it was only a small one so I ordered 100 more and it still wasn't enough to even cover the bottom. Well just before his 1st birthday, it popped and I ordered him a much better and bigger pit, so I of course needed the balls to go with it. The 100 I had previously ordered were very small in size and I paid the same price as I paid for the 250 BalanceForm balls, which are bigger in size, and do not crush, and have a variety of more colors! Not only that but I got a warranty with them as well! They arrived BEFORE the expected delivery date and my son LOVES his ball pit, regardless of the fact that I am constantly picking them up from everywhere (I don't know how they get into some of the places they end up \ud83e\udd23) I am so glad that I went with this company\n \n  Great balls for home ball pits ! We got the 400 pack and are very very happy with the product . The balls feel high quality and came packaged in a bag that will be handy to store the balls as well . My 3 yo has been jumping in and out of his makeshift ball pit for the past 30 min and no damage yet . Highly recommend! \n  After searching for the best value, I settled on these and I am so glad I did. I waited a month or so to write my review to see how they would hold up. Not one ball collapsed, they\u2019re perfect for his small ball pit and have been put to the test for sure. You couldn\u2019t want more, look no further, they are cheap and durable.\n \n  Kiddos got a kick out of the batch of balls we purchased. Oldest loved the \"rainbow\" colors. This is the 400pk...give or take about 15 that we already had...in our smarTrike Indoor Activity Center. I was worried it would be too many but it is just right. Definitely made a difference between seeing the floor of it and no floor at all.  My oldest plays challenges to find things she puts in it now, lol.. We just may buy more to put into an inflatable pool but we will see. Its hot out there so inside works for now.\n \n  This is an update on a previous post where I discussed how unsatisfied I was with the seller and called them dishonest for selling a product and committing to an arrival date when they obviously didn't have the stock. Well, the balls arrived a week late and even though we didn\u2019t have them in time for my daughter\u2019s birthday surprise, the kids are having a blast in their new ball pit. This is a good deal for the amount of play balls you\u2019re getting so if you don\u2019t have a deadline and are a patient person, it would be worth the savings to buy this product.\n \n  these are really great balls! Pretty colors and very sturdy\u2014they don\u2019t really give at all when you squeeze them. The amount filled a small foldable ball pit well enough that it didn\u2019t look pathetic once you poured them inside. ", "\n  6 month old loving these so far! Balls have a little give to ensure not to hard to land on but none were popped. All 400 seem quality. Love the colors better than the picture. Bag to store them in is good too fits balls well not stretched out to fit all back in... zips nicely. Will buy again if needed. 400 balls fill a 50\" pit almost covers my 6 month old. May need 2 bags (800 balls) to fill pit for toddler\n \n  My kiddos really love these ball pit balls. They are sturdy and so far crush proof like the ad says! The colors are very vibrant and while rifling through them, it seems they are all smooth an no jagged plastic edges or anything. They came in a sturdy mesh bag with a zipper enclosure that seems like it should hold up to the test of time. Overall, we are extremely satisfied with these.\n \n  Perfect size. Sturdy. Not flimsy. My daughter loves playing in them and the colors are fun and bright\n \n  These were a great addition for our trampoline along with being able to play with them inside or the pool anywhere you'd like! My daughter and husband are equally having tons of fun with them! I would recommend this purchase for the kids :) \n  This is fantastic! These balls are so much better than the cheap balls you can get at the store. They put up with several children and we haven\u2019t had any casualties, they don\u2019t crush at all. This is also a perfect amount of balls to fit the ballpit we also bought from amazon. We could even stand to put more in as well. This was also the best price for the amount of balls we got versus other listings on this website. Highly recommend\n \n  I ordered these ball pit balls for my kiddos I babysit and they are loving it!! When it\u2019s a little chilly out to swim, I pour them in the pool, or pour them in our trampoline! They really love pretending they\u2019re in a ball pit! They are very sturdy, if the kids bite them or try to smash them and they go right back to their original form! It\u2019s a total hit for the kids! It comes in a mesh bag which is amazing for cleaning them up and storing them, or traveling with them too if you\u2019d like!\n \n  I ordered a 500pk from another company and wanted some more for our child's ball pit. The 400pk was on sale so I went ahead and got them. \n  My daughter is turning 11months old this week and I used that as an excuse to get her a ball pit. I got the bag of 400 and put them in her playpen. They are so colorful and fun. They are crush proof too. I know this as I have played in them... \n  Husband and I ordered these balls for a small house/ballpit we got for our son's birthday. They didnt seem like much in the bag, but once we put them in the pit, they work great! 200 didn't should like many, but we have some in the bag still. Until our son gets a little older and will play more with them. (He just turned one, and it says 3+) He loves them, so that means we do too. I didn't see about other colors, I would have gotten a darker color than what my husband ordered. BUT that's the only thing I MIGHT change. Overall, will order more if needed.\n \n  We ordered this for our daughters to fill up a blow up pool and have their own ball pit! The balls came in a nice mesh carrying case that makes clean up and containment when they aren't in the ball pit an absolute breeze! The balls are nice colors and a nice size for my little ones to enjoy! The product came with a 2 year warrant card with info on how to contact them should we need any help and that to me says so much about a company! We are completely satisfied and super happy we purchased these balls for our girls! They love them!\n ", "\n  Great product. We have a mix of balls from target and a baby ball pit, and have now added these to our collection. They are slightly larger (enough that a toddler cannot fit the ball in their mouth) and seem much more sturdy than the other ones we have. Though not quite as soft, these balls do not crush as easily either. They are inflated a bit more than the other balls. \n  Got kids? \n  Ordered these on 5/Apr/2020, they were delivered today, 23/Apr/2020 due to... things that are occurring in the world. \n  Who doesn't like some nice solid balls?? These balls won't go soft on you. They are definitely ones that can stand the test of time. They don't shrink. They don't get indented. And most of all they don't feel cheap or plastic-y. Not to mention you get 400 of them for an amazing price... I'll probably end up buying more of them. While they may not be the biggest balls around, these balls will definitely not leave you blue!\n \n  These balls are really good quality. They even come with a two year warranty, what kind of plastic balls come with that? I bought 200 and put them in the kiddie pool with water. 200 doesn\u2019t fill up The pool enough for being a ball pit, but it\u2019s perfect for them to play with the balls while they\u2019re using the pool with water. They try to sink the balls and they come back up and they love it. We also put this combination of water and balls at the end of their big slide in the swing set and they slide on top of the balls and they don\u2019t get crashed. Excellent quality. Endless ways to play with them\n \n  Price was great for 400 balls. They will hold up to our little kids for a while. We bought them for a pop up ball pit also purchased on Amazon. 400 sounds like a lot but it really only creates 2 layers of balls in the bottom of the pit with is about 3.5 feet across. Its plenty though,  especially when its time to clean up whats been thrown around the living room \ud83d\ude01\n \n  these are slightly smaller than your average ball pit ball and I specifically wanted that as I was getting these for an 11 mo baby. They can fit in her little hand perfectly and she loves picking them up and trying to chew on them. Not one of them was dented upon arrival and I received a few more than 400 in the bag. Would recommend!\n \n  Product looks good but smaller than I expected. Not super small, the individual balls are about half the size I thought they'd be. User error, it's listed clearly. I will be keeping them though!\n \n  These are the best ball pit balls I\u2019ve found. Cheapest per ball and also very durable. They\u2019re flexible so if you squeeze them, they bounce right back to their original shape. Very impressed with the quality. Some other reviewers said they were missing some balls so I counted and got exactly 400. I\u2019ll probably need to buy some more, 400 isn\u2019t as much as it seems. Love the colors and can\u2019t wait to get the ball pit set up for my sons 1st birthday! Highly recommend.\n \n  We bought these to make a ball pit for our son's 1st birthday. He and kids of different ages at the part LOVED them. They are great quality and can be squeezed/smashed without permanently crushing or denting the balls. They are smaller than the ball pit balls I grew up with as a kid but are still awesome. The colors are fun. I took advice from other reviews and rinsed the balls out in the shower before letting the kids play with them in case of any left over chemicals. No one had a reaction (and our child has sensitive skin). I also love the reusable bag they come in and the quantity is enough to fill a small kiddie pool.\n ", "\n  Great price for the amount of balls purchased. I loved the vivid colors of the balls! They are in a mesh zippered bag, that makes it so convenient for storage. I also liked that they were not extremely hard. The perfect size for little hands. I purchased these for my granddaughter for a Christmas present, and they arrived in a very timely manner. I plan on putting them in her pack 'n play! I can't wait to give them to her and watch her first time experience with them!!! I hope she will be as excited as I am! I can't wait!\n \n  There was no bad smell but I washed them before playing. My baby loves those play balls! Its one of his favorite toys! The balls are in various colors Im pretty sure that babies love them. The balls can be easily hold up by those little cute baby hands. I was told by friends that 300 balls or even 500 balls would not be enough so I bought the 800 one.\n None None None \n  \u00a0We use this product for our rainy days and need to entertain our client's dogs. We also use it to feed our dog, Abbie. She's the one starring in the video while eating her lunch. It allows for stimulation and keeps her nice and busy while also forcing her to slow down. The balls themselves are nice and durable, we machine wash them to clean them up. Honestly wish I could rate them higher than a 5 star rating!\n None None None \n  \u00a0My sons really enjoyed these in there ball pit tent. I noticed after they rolled around on them they didn't go flat. So, I'd definitely say these are sturdy. I like the mesh bag they came in as well. It makes moving and storing them very easy. Lot of bright colors as well.\n \n  These are definitely superior quality to the last balls I purchased (and none of those crushed, so these are really great!!!) \n  I originally bought these for my 1 year old son, but it seems like every time I put him in the ball pit, I have an urge to go in with him. Feels like I'm a kid again. Purchased 1000 balls at this point, may get a large inflatable one and order more. Soon. \n  UPDATE: The balls are great. However, the company promises to send you 100 balls if you leave a review on amazon. I left a review, notified them of my post, but have heard no response from the company and have not received any balls. The company is full of it. Wouldn\u2019t 100% trust. \n  I purchased these for a ball pit I gave my grandson.  They are really a  nice quality, do not collapse easily unless under the pressure of a large Labradoodle's teeth OR a giant size 13 shoe.  Otherwise, my 11 month old grandson loves to pay with them, they are large enough that he can hold them comfortably but not put them in his mouth.  I would buy again.\n \n  I just used a few as I am awaiting my grandsons ballpit to arrive. Pros: the balls arrived in a netted zipper bag great for storing the balls, the colors were bright and a good assortment of colors. Con: they are small so not sure 400 will be enough but since the price was very reasonable for the amount you receive I would order another box of 400.\n \n  I haven't used these play balls in a ball pit yet, but I washed them all with soap and water (they seemed very clean anyway, but I am super conscious of contaminants etc), and I loved that none of them seemed to have jagged seams, and all were air tight. They also have a great amount of air inside so my 1-year-old can squeeze them in his grasp. All in all they seem like a nice product, and competitively priced. Wishing I could select the colors myself, as I'm probably going to give away the red and pink since those colors horribly clash with our play room and will make my brain itch, and I would have liked to have more orange or order orange separately. Hoping this company decides to offer orange down the road...\n ", "\n  I bought a large ball pit for my son and bought these. I had previously bought some balls at Walmart and compared to those these are about 1/2 inch smaller maybe 1/4 nothing significant. What was significant was the sturdiness the ones from Walmart were flimsy and easy to destroy these are sturdy and like the lively colors will be buying more\n \n  These are colorful and high quality balls. I ordered 800 balls hoping to fill a kiddie pool. Unfortunately the kiddie pool is so big, and the 1 bag of balls I received can't even cover the bottom. I think they should have sent me 2 mesh bags. But even that won't be enough. I will need at least 8000 balls for the task. If this is for a smaller ballpit these balls will work great!\n \n  At first my daughter didn't quite know what to think of her new ball pit but now she loves it and crawls in there on her own to play. The balls were a fantastic value, none have flattened and are very comfy to play in. Instead of 400 I only got 384 but meh I guess. I'm still super pleased! Love them!\n \n  Bought this for my niece as a birthday present and these balls have been nothing but solid units. They are alot sturdier comparing to the ones i bought from normal stores and felt more flexible. \n  One of the balls in the pack was defective and misshapen, so I guess we have 399 pretty good ones. The balls are ok for an infants ball pit. I am not sure how long they will last. I still feel they were a bit expensive for what they are. I washed them with soap and water in the bathtub before I allowed my child to play with them. I have pictures for scale.\n \n  If you are looking for fun, you have found it. These are awesome and sturdy yet soft. My kid regularly chucks them towards his brother and, no tears! They have ended up everywhere in our home so I\u2019m sure we have lost a few to the abyss under the couch. The colors are bright. I would recommend these\n \n  These balls are perfect for our ball pit for our 5 year old to play in. They are bright and colorful, not too hard but not too soft. I'm so glad I chose these balls to purchase. The price is also better than what else I've seen for the same amount of balls. So I highly recommend these balls.\n \n  We had bought these for our two toddlers for their ball bit, but after a few uses, half of them were crushed, so they are not crush-proof as the description stated. The net that they came in was flimsy and the zipper broke after taking the balls out of it the first time I received them.\n \n  These play balls are exactly what we were looking for. My twins are 1 1/2 and the balls do not crush in their hand when trying to pick them up or when they end sitting on the balls, but are soft enough to not hurt when they toss them at each other. Great quality! Children and parents approved! Will be buying more when we get a bigger play area.\n \n  Great quality! My 9yr old and almost 6yr old have been playing with these(and roughly I might add) and have not ruined a single one! No dents no damage whatsoever! And I love the size! They\u2019re small but it\u2019s good because they\u2019re kids and have small hands so it\u2019s an easy grip. We fill a box up with it and they cannonball and throw them around. My oldest even plays baseball with them. Highly recommend if you want something durable. Also the bright colors catch the attention of my little one (almost 2). He loves to bite and scratch  everything And he can\u2019t damage them either! Never seen something that my kids can\u2019t destroy.\n ", "\n  Although it is a nice number of balls for the price some of them were damaged when they were delivered while some popped as soon as my little one put her weight on them. They are a nice size but if they would be a little thicker would last much longer. My baby is only 20 lbs and was able to pop them, I don't see them last long when she will gain more weight\n \n  Honestly we thought we were buying balls with a larger diameter and when these arrived I was at first disappointed. However after my daughter got to play with them they're the perfect size. They fill the ballpit perfectly and the others would have been too large for her hands. Solid product and good quality. Colors are accurate to the description and photos.\n \n  These balls are prefect! They are colorful a nice variety of different colors, they are sturdier then balls I have ordered in the past! And to top it all off they come in a nice mesh bag for storage!  Shipping was as stated! Would defiantly buy more from Thai company if we need more!  Plus they have a warranty!!\n \n  These things are fantastic. They really are pretty crushproof. They\u2019re relatively thick which is nice and adds to their sturdiness. I ordered 400 of them to fill an inflatable kiddie pool for my 16 month old and he absolutely loves rolling around in them. He likes to throw them sometimes and they end up under my foot and even with my 250lb step, they hold their shape and don\u2019t crack. Really happy with this purchase.\n \n  The balls themselves are fine. Exactly what you\u2019d expect from balls for a ball pit. None of them are dented after the kids played with them. But there won\u2019t be as many balls in here as you expect. It\u2019s exactly how many they say will be in there, but if you\u2019re wondering how many to buy to fill up whatever ball pit you are trying to fill, the answer is more.\n \n  Definitely get you money's worth. They are cheaper than most and the balls are well made. My daughter is 6 and stepped on one and it didn't even crush it. My toddlers love playing with them in the ball pit and trampoline. The 400 balls was not enough to fill our tiny ball pit, but was plenty to still enjoy it.\n \n  These balls are surprisingly very sturdy. We used them for a ball pit with a bunch of 1 year olds and they loved it. We bought 800 thinking we could make 2 ball pits - 1 out of each bag, but there wasn't enough balls, so we used both bags to make just 1 ball pit. The balls were great, but I would definitely error on the side of ordering too many balls, than not enough. We filled up a kid sized inflatable pool with the 800 and it would out great for us. The bags it comes with are very handy and work well too. They are a pain to fill up once you have dumped all the balls out, but there's nothing you can really do about that.\n \n  These are great. Super light weight and completely sealed so they won\u2019t squish flat. We use them in our 2 year old ball pit and they take a beating ha ha. They have been everywhere in closing the sink and bathtub also and never had any issues. I highly recommend these balls \ud83d\ude02\n \n  After reading reviews I stuck with these ones mostly cause of the 5 stars. This was the best value out off all I looked into. I counted and got 404. The color is much more vibrant than pictured which is my favorite bc I didn\u2019t want them to be too dark. I got a big play pen and might get another 400, but this was just enough for the teepee.\n \n  These balls work great in my daughter's ball pit! She's had it for a few weeks now and none of the balls have been crushed, even when she jumps in there relentlessly! I grabbed a ball for myself and realized that it takes a good amount of pressure to get them to give way, but even when they do, they bounce right back to their original shape. I was pleasantly surprised by their quality, since there are so many of them!\n ", "\n  The colors came as expected. The balls were smaller than anticipated. Surprisingly only 2 balls were crushed  upon opening, the rest felt strong and durable to play.  But I am dividing this up with friends so we counted them out. We were missing 38 balls not including the 2 crushed balls. We ordered the pack of 1000 and received 962/1000. In contacting Amazon the only way to remedy this was to return the order for a refund. Which is not worth the trouble if we need to reorder them again anyways.\n \n  This was a great buy. My only complaint is we had a hand full of balls split after a few months and the points on them are hard and hazardous. Other than that our children have enjoyed the ball pit and play in it often.\n \n  My daughter recently received a kids ball pit as a gift that came with 20 balls. After assembling the ball pit, i realized that 20 balls was not nearly enough. I took to Amazon and found these Non-Toxic Crush Proof Play Balls (QTY 200). At the time i didn't really think about the quality or \"crush proof\" of the balls, but when these Non-Toxic Crush Proof Play Balls came in i could quickly tell that they were far superior to the balls that came with the ball pit. The balls feel like a good quality product in our hand, when you try to crush them you can tell the material is pushing back at you fingers try to regain its shape. I also that the coloring of the balls was bright and colorful. Great product for kids! 100% satisfied customer!\n \n  LOVE these!! We use these in a ball pit for our one year old and she plays with these balls for hours. Be ready to have them all over the house but it\u2019s totally worth it. Great quality for the price. We got some balls that came with another toy and it just proved to us the difference between these and cheaper options! It\u2019s definitely worth the extra few bucks!!\n \n  These balls were delivered 10 minutes ago, and I\u2019m all ready giving it 5 stars. The size, colors, material is absolutely perfect! I\u2019m never gonna be able to get my little dude out of our ball ever again. Absolutely the best value of ball pit balls I\u2019ve found anywhere.\n \n  most balls are really good and the colors are pretty, however there were over 10 smashed balls. I emailed the company, but they did not respond.\n \n  I bought these to put in a tent for my 10 month old granddaughter.  I also  put them in her bubble bath and in her kiddie pool.  She loves them.  They are the right size for her little hands.  They are pretty sturdy.  I will probably order them again when she gets older to fill up her tent.\n \n  We set up a small (8 ft diameter) blow up pool in one of our rooms and bought a 400 count pack of these balls to surprise our then-9-month old son.  He loved them!  The colors were bright and vibrant, there was a good mix of colors (pink, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue), and the size was perfect for him to pick up, mouth, hold, and throw.  Once he turned a year old and become more mobile in the ball pit, we actually went back and purchased another pack, also 400 count, in order to fill up the pool.  The recent set is a little more transparent than the first but the colors and sizes are still excellent.  I would not hesitate to purchase them again.\n \n  Balls are colorful (received a set with 6 different colors: red, pink, orange, blue, yellow, green) and looks strudy - strong enough to keep its structure under a toddler, but have not tested with an adult... I did not count the total number of balls but looks like less than 400, may be because of the size of the balls and their total volume in the ball pit.. I hardly have second row of balls in the pit..\n \n  Really pleased with our order. We bought them for a sensory room we are setting up for our son, and they're just what we wanted and expected. The mesh bag holding them was a great addition, so i can store them easily when cleaning. Overall, very happy with purchase.\n ", "\n  Love the colors, none of them arrived squished. My toddler has a blast playing with them and I appreciate the mesh bag to contain them all. They didn't have a strong odor on arrival either. \n  Omgosh!! I finally got them and my daughter absolutely loves them... she has been playing with them all day since I got them.. the colors are so cute and they are soft enough for my 8 month. I totally recommend to anyone. They were shipped fast and got exactly what I ordered:)\n \n  Ordered these for my 6 month old. They are wonderful. They arrived in perfect condition. The only regret we have is not ordering more (pic with baby for scale). We have now ordered another 800 for our outdoor ball pit.\n \n  Bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it! They bales are very durable and don\u2019t dent in. They were jumping on them and sitting on them and they would not bend. The colors are really nice, only down fall, was that I thought they would be a little bigger. Overall good purchase\n None None None \n  \u00a0These balls are great for the price you pay. They can take some weight without breaking. I sat on one and I weigh 317lbs and never broke. My little sister loves them. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has a little one.\n \n  My son just loves all the extra fun these gave his ball pit. So far after weeks of use only 2 have been crushed and there were small imperfections in the sealing of them. I\u2019m not mad at that because I didn\u2019t even notice imperfections till they were crushed by his little feet lol seems like a steep price for some plastic balls but well worth the smile it puts on your kids face.\n \n  Very happy!! I looked all over amazon for a good price on balls. I also wanted quantity AND quality for my money which seemed to be impossible until I found these. I went with the reviews and gave it a shot and I am not disappointed. \n  I love these item. I purchase for my kids for summer and they are great quality have not use them yet.but the colour s are bright and look like it will not change. Has great quality feel. Hope my review help and I will definitely purchase more. Did get my money worth and received exactly 200 balls. Was not less. Thank you balance from for making my kids happy.\n \n  This was the perfect amount of balls for our ball pit! They\u2019re brightly colored and sturdy upon first use. My three year old was thrilled to receive them in the mail! They were also a great value (more balls and less expensive than all the others we looked at) which made me happy with the purchase. They came in a sturdy mesh bag with a zipper for storage. I\u2019d definitely buy them again.\n \n  I ordered 400 of these balls and theyre great! SLIGHTLY smaller than the usual ball pit balls but theyre much more sturdy and the colors are vibrant. I definitely shouldve ordered double even tho my 2yr old doesnt care whether its full or not lol\n ", "\n  COUNT THE BALLS! it seems to be a trend with these balls that you never get as many as you pay for. I ordered 2 sets as birthday gifts and one bag is missing 6 balls, the other is missing 12! Not only did I not receive the amount I paid for, they are much smaller than advertised and kinda flimsy. They are soft and easily squished. I really hope the seller/manufacturer will address the ongoing issue of missing balls because paying for a total of 400 balls and only recieving 382 is super irritating and not very professional.\n \n  These are amazing! I purchased them as a gift for my niece, and she loves them! We purchased a ball pit separately and filled it up, she can sit in there all day with no worries! They are safe, don\u2019t break, and soft enough for a 1 year old to play with safely. These are the perfect addition to her collection of toys. Even the dog loves them!\n \n  I bought 200 balls which was enough to cover only the bottom of the ball pit. I probably need another 200 to make it more fun. These balls came in a mesh sack and are the size and color I expected. However, they aren\u2019t extremely sturdy like I thought they would be but it\u2019s a good buy for the price\n \n  Balls were advertised as a set of 200. We only received 193 balls in our mesh package! Might not seam like a big deal if they were high quality, but as you can see in the image (green ball on the left) they are smaller and thinner than another set we purchased for a cheaper price (red ball on right). Not going to send them back as our little one is excited to play in the ball pit, buyer beware! Find an alternative, at least you might get the total number of balls as advertised!\n \n  The ball count was inaccurate. I counted the balls because the boxed seemed small and surely it was not 200 balls. It was short not by much, but not everything I paid for which is upsetting.  I contacted the company who redirected me to amazon. Long battle no result\n \n  Absolutely disappointed. They are beautiful but unfortunately I have to give this product a 2 out of 5. They are  slightly spike, scratched up, dirty, and I only got 900 and not 1000!!! I had to sit and clean each one like a good mom should so I separated them in 100s. My kids Absolutely love them. So if you can get past the damage and losing 100 of what you paid for than they are perfect.\n \n  These are so much fun on the trampoline for my kids! They have a blast with them. I will say they do squish a bit but my kids are jumping with them so keep that in mind. They aren't hard and solid but when you squish them the indention pops back out.\n \n  These are the best value for money ball Pitt balls i have found anywhere. Not only are they affordable  but they hold up well and they look nice. At first I wanted neutral colors but baby likes bright stuff and I'm not the one who is going to be playing with them most of the time.\n \n  Purchased these balls to go with a fold up pop up kids gym with a ball pit area for a kids birthday party. The balls were a perfect size for the 2 year olds - 6 year olds to enjoy. I love that the balls came in a mesh bag for easy storage.\n \n  These were a great buy.  Sturdy and great value for the money.  Nice bright colors.  They are only slightly smaller than the average pit balls, but you cannot really tell the difference when they're all mixed together.  They came in time and packaged properly.\n ", "\n  We got these to replace obliterated Fisher Price balls. These are definitely not crush proof - my almost-2-year-old can squeeze them in, and smaller than the FP brand. We were also short about 20 balls, but can't fit all of them in her small ball pit (tent) at one time anyhow. Love the colors and she loves the balls.\n None None None \n  \u00a0My dog loves her ball pit! She has chewed one ball that was left unattended, but overall quality is great! I recommended them to her sister! *not good for super chewers, Denali doesn\u2019t tear apart her toys unless in her crate for hours.\n \n  I ordered a bunch of these and they are wonderful.  Bright colors.  Arrived clean exactly as described (although I still washed them all in my bathtub since my baby will put them directly into his mouth).  The mesh net bags they come in make it very easy to clean and then hang out side to dry after washing. \n  What kid doesn\u2019t love these things?! Bought them for my one year old and his 7 year old brother loves them just as much. I got the tent for them that helps contain the ball madness. This was a big hit Christmas morning and they still jump in there and go to town. I plan to bring them outside this summer, should be a hit in the kiddy pool!\n \n  I bought this for my 7 month old baby and he love it. I cant get him out of olay pen with the ball... Balls are very durable and dont squeeze at all i try it my self i evwn got in the pen to play worh my boy.. totally worth it. You guys wont regret it..\n \n  We love these balls! Been using them with our toddler since he was about a year old and he is now 18 months. Order more than you think you need :) it always surprises me how much a ball pit really takes. They don\u2019t crunch under weight as he is a big boy and weighs 32lbs. All are still completely round and he slides into them all the time.\n \n  These balls were a great price and served the purpose for filling my makeshift ball pool. The only downfall is that these balls are not hard plastic but will crunch and they are not as durable. My little pom chewed a few up. They can not serve as a ball for regular play .\n \n  After reading MULTIPLE 5 star reviews, it was time to buy! These balls are great for the price! They come in a mesh bag- perfect for storage. We currently use our ball pit balls in the pack n play for a mini ball pit and they are super fun for bath time!\n \n  Good product, plastic is a little thin but time will tell how long they hold up. For my 1 year old I don't think he will be able to pop one but if I stood on it might be a different story. Bag provided is very thin material but should hold up with proper handling. Over all would buy again. For the price u can't beat it.\n \n  These are absolutely stunning- the colors are bright and brilliant making a ball pit seem look even more exciting and fun for our toddler.  The ball have a wonderful smooth texture and are not too hard, 5-Stars! Lastly, Finally, the balls are odor free which made them come ready-to-use (other ball pit balls I have purchased seem to have a distinct plastic smell). Will buy again!\n ", "\n  My 10 month old loves the ball pit. We just put them in his pack in play till his actual ball pit comes and hes so excited. Theres so many colors and options he doesnt know where to start. Very happy with this product. And I counted them and we actual ended up with 432 with is well lover the 400 we ordered\n \n  Great balls. 99% of them are in perfect shape. Out of 400 there were 2 with a couple of weird seams but still usable. The balls come in a mesh bag which makes it pretty easy to wash them all off at once in the shower or something\n \n  We got the package and out of curiosity, we decided to count the number of balls to see if they indeed added up to 200, and to our dismay, it did not we counted twice, and both times we got a count of 193. So, I feel it's a bit of false advertisement and they didn't think people will take the time to count them.\n \n  My granddaughter purchased a ball pit that came with NO balls! I hurried and ordered these balls. They arrived super quickly and are as advertised!  My GREAT-granddaughter absolutely loves them, as you can see by the attached picture. Thank you so much for a great product!\n \n  We ordered 2 packs of 800 for a 5ft kiddie pool. These were such a hit for our son's first birthday. The balls are really sturdy and my husband didn't even crush them. The colors are pretty and these are the right size for a toddler's hands. Will definitely buy them again.\n \n  My older kids wanted their baby sister to get a ball pit for Christmas- one like they used to have as toddlers. I shopped around for the best deals during holiday sales and these ball won for quantity and value. \n  I bought my son a pop up tunnel ... or obstacle course and used these balls to fill it ... I bought a smaller set of balls as well because to me the more balls , the merrier ... but shipping was seamless and the baggie the balls come in is cool too.\n \n  I ordered 2 of the 800 packs, so 1600 balls. The pit I made is 4x7. (Still have to add pool noodles). They arrived pretty quickly. Soft enough not to hurt when you get hit with them, but not so soft they\u2019ll bust when you step on them. Will definitely be ordering more in the future!\n \n  We bought these to build a ball pit for our baby's first birthday, and he has had an absolute blast playing in them and throwing them all over. I washed them in the tub before first use, but they have provided hours of fun for him. The balls seem very sturdy as I accidentally sat on a few as I joined him, are big enough to be chewed on without worry of swallowing. The 400 count was the perfect amount to turn his pack'n'play into the personal ball pit of dreams.\n \n  The balls themselves seem great and durable but the mesh bag they came with was not sewn properly at the seam which leaves a large hole and makes it useless to store the balls. As soon as I pulled the bag out of the box. Balls started falling from it. This made me wonder if I actually received all 400 balls, so I counted them and was short. I tried contacting the seller, Balance Form, and the link to their website doesn't work, I tried searching online for them and nothing came up, and the phone number provided for customer support was a cell phone that automatically went to VM and the mailbox was full.\n ", "\n  These are perfect! I counted them and there was 404. It looks like less but there really is 400+ \n  Overall, I am pretty happy with my order. The balls are sturdy, while still being soft enough for children to enjoy. I should have bought more. I ordered 200, and since they are slightly smaller than than the usual size, I definitely need more to fill up the pool. I am happy and would buy again. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I only received 190 balls and not 200.\n \n  My son loves them, got a pack for his spare play pen. You may want to get 2 packs if you think you will only need 1... otherwise it'll be shallow. My boy is only 1 so it's fine; he's even easily amazed at non-toys... Lol\n \n  We bought 400 to use in a 48\" ball pit for our two yorkie puppies. We only needed 200 so far, but will add the other 200 as they get taller. lol. They love to search for the handful of kibble I throw in, keeps them busy for 30 minutes!\n \n  My son is just loving these balls specially because of the quality and color. Very clean and easy packaging. Easy to store balls bag that comes with this order.  ball quality is good and weight of the ball is perfect for 1-2 year old kid. \n  We love these ball pit balls! We bought these for our son\u2019s first birthday and they were a huge hit. They\u2019re super durable and we\u2019re also grateful that they\u2019re really easy to wash (tossed them all in the tub after the party to sanitize). Love the simple net bag to store them all in afterwards too. \n  I made a mistake in thinking these would be normal sized pit balls but they are tiny and don\u2019t add up to enough. My fault as they did have the size noted on the headline. The balls are sturdy and my baby can\u2019t swallow them when he attempts to eat them.\n \n  I got these ball pit balls super quick. As soon as I took them out the bag and put them in the ball pit, my kiddos (ages 1,4, and 11) went absolutely nuts!!!! They are having so much fun! It even got my 11 year old off his video game and into the ball pit with his brother and sister. I can already see countless hours of fun and bonding for them. The balls are great quality and they don\u2019t have that weird plastic smell either. Very satisfied customers!!!!\n \n  These are amazing!! We use them in our trampoline, and even with the kids (&mom) jumping on them, they don\u2019t dent. I also love that they are kind of a thin plastic, so they don\u2019t hurt when thrown at each other like some other harder balls. They also came way faster than expected, love the mesh bag, and a great price for the amount of balls.\n \n  So firstly, I ordered the 400 Count of balls for my kids ball-pit.  One mesh bag of maybe 150 balls arrived instead of the 400 i was charged for. Secondly, the balls are rather flimsily made and are nowhere near crush proof, several arrived already crushed. At the cost, I'd suggest finding another option for Ball Pit balls\n ", "\n  We got our 200 pack of balls super fast and filled up our ballpit right away. They work perfectly and I am very happy with them as is the 2yo I watch. They are very sturdy and hold up well with his rough playing. I will definitely be buying more.\n \n  10x's better than another brand I've purchased!  The balls were completely filled and had a thick feeling to it.  Quality is not cheap at all.  Use these to fill a small inflatable Minnie ball pit for my daughters room.  Completely recommend! it comes in a cute mesh zipper bag, which I'll probably use to throw in the washer for her socks.\n \n  Our daughter loves playing with these! She just learned how to say \"ball\" and she'll bring me one of these each time she says it! They fit perfectly in her hand. I have accidentally stepped on a few and they have not broken or cracked! They will definitely last through multiple children! The amount was the perfect fit for the ball pit that we also ordered from amazon! Also love that they are phthalate free, BPA free, and non-toxic. Great product!!\n \n  I'm pleased the most with the purchase of these balls more than the last two purchases of balls I've made these came very fast very durable they just pop back my kids love them and they have a 2 year warrantee also all 200 was there\n \n  These are the best balls out there! They don\u2019t easily crush and the colors are bright! Don\u2019t hesitate to buy them. If you want a full ball pit I suggest you buy atleast 2. Best purchase. Children love playing in ball pits!\n \n  Thank you for these excellent set of balls. I can't wait for my son to play with his balls. When my wife saw what I had purchased, she rolled her eyes, and I just responded, \"you know you like my balls\" and her eyes rolled even further. These balls are just great, not too hard, not too soft, they are just right.\n \n  These were a little smaller than I thought they would be, so I ordered 400 more to fill my son's ball pit.  We have had them about a week and they have been crush-proof after a 1, 2, and 7 year old all played in it.  The colors are really cute as well!\n \n  Depends on what you are looking for. The balls aren't as sturdy as the ones you would find at a bouncy castle in a mall. My child loses interest fast, so something that would last for a couple of months for this price is good I think.\n \n  These balls are an option if you want a bunch of play balls.  They are a little bit smaller than most of our other balls. You do get 400 balls (ours actually had 405) so it is a good value. Only complaint I have is that they are thin, so they do not hold up well. I had 6 of them squish and tear the first time we played with them.\n None None None \n  \u00a0We purchased these for our 11 month old! Love them. We put them right into his pack n play & he loves throwing them around & playing. We will be getting more as time goes on :)\n ", "\n  My 11 month old loves these.  They are a little smaller than the typical ball pit ball, which make them the perfect size to fit in his chubby little hands.  We ordered 400 to go in a ball pit.  We will probably order more, although my guy had fun playing with only 100 in the card board box they came in.  Great value for that quantity.  It was the best I could find on Amazon.  Also, the colors are nice and bright!\n \n  I bought 800, only 1 bag of 400 was in the box (huge box that easily would have fit 800)\n \n  Cute bright colors. These balls are not the size of balls u would find at chuckle cheese they are smaller( my one year old can palm a ball) I bought 400 and they didn\u2019t fill up the small toddler pool I have so I will need about 500 more.however they are big enough that he can\u2019t fit them in his mouth. I personally think they\u2019re a perfect size for kids  age 1-7 years old.\n \n  We purchased this to go into a kids ball pit play area. Ours is very large and we should have ordered more balls. When you think the count is good order the larger amount. Light weight, have not tried outside but a fan will blow them across the floor. Color was uniform and bright but not obnoxious.\n \n  Not bad for the money! It is a lot more expensive in stores. If your child sits on them, they will get crushed; but won\u2019t hurt if your child throws them at another child or you! lol.  Easy to wash- threw them in bath tub with soap and hot water.\n \n  Bought these for a ball pit, wanting vibrant and beautiful colors, but also to be safe for my one year old. They are PERFECT! And a great price for so many! I also enjoy the bag so they can be put away too! Very satisfied with everything.\n \n  Omg we love this balls . It\u2019s very durable and it not getting  squished . My kids love this and size of the ball is very good my kids and hold it properly \ud83d\ude00. I am gonna order another 400 balls to play.\n \n  These balls are worth every penny. The kids play with these in so many ways and places....the dog loves them too. The kids can \u201csurf\u201d on top of them in this enclosed area....hours and hours of fun.\n \n  Worked our perfect for the ball pit! All balls were in great condition and they don\u2019t dent when sat on by any weight. The only down side is that my kids tend to throw half of them out of the pit which means 200 more things to clean up every night.\n \n  This product was much better quality then the balls i origanally ordered from wish. THis product was much better in terms of the balls do not cave in when squeezed as easily or stay deformed they are thicker as well as bigger than the other ones. I will buy this again for my daughters first birthday in 2 months i want to do a ball pit and these balls are perfect for it. The colors are also very pretty and bright vs the other product which were light and flimsy\n ", "\n  My 1y/o daughter loves them! The box they showed up in was a little smaller than expected because the balls are a little smaller than expected but turns out they work fantastic. If you\u2019re set on a certain quantity, I recommend going up or doubling it.\n \n  I shopped for weeks for the right balls for my sons ball pit. I wanted something that was durable, attractive, and sturdy. I ran into all kinds of options for sizes and colors. After reading reviews for many, many listings (and taking lots of measurements), I decided on these. I am pleased with my purchase. They colors are not harsh and are visually pleasing, the balls are also not flimsy like I\u2019ve seen. I got one of those cheap kiddie pools from the grocery store and purchased two hundred balls. The balls cover the bottom surface of the pool. I\u2019d definitely say to order way more than you think.\n \n  These are by far the best and great price to I have ball pit balls from 4 different brands now and these are much stronger they feel much sturdier then the others. What I like most is they have no brand or any writing on the balls them self perfectly smooth.\n \n  Very pleased with the product I brought. It came exactly when it was supposed to. I ordered 400 balls. Every ball was there and believed I have an extra 3. The balls was in a nice netted bag with a zipper all the balls was fully round, bright colors ,no faded ones, no damage ones and most importantly no chemical plastic smell. Perfect for my son ball pit. Will be ordering another 400asap.wasnt sure how many I would need but at least now I know the product is perfect.\n \n  These are pretty strong. My granddaughter throws herself into these and barely any have broken. They came as expected and we got as many as advertised. Great price for the quality of the product.\n \n  A little small but sturdy if you are filling a ball pit buy bigger balls 2.3 vs 2.5 makes a big difference in price I bought 400 2.5 balls and it took up close to the same amount of space as buying 800 of 2.3 balls.\n \n  I'm a dork so i counted the balls... there were 403 in there! We purchased a ball pit that Came empty. We bought this product to fill it up, and we bought it a second time (total 800 balls). Its still not completely full but it's looking pretty amazing. These balls are very durable. I get on the ball pit with the little guy and somehow no balls end up crushed. Also they're the perfect size... not too big and not too small. would love to leave a few pictures but it wont allow me\n \n  The balls themselves are bright, colorful and nicely sized. The only issue we had was with the shipping. If you are in a rush do not order them. The first order we placed got lost - the tracking was no help as it showed it going from the warehouse, to my town, back to the warehouse and all over the place. After a few days they offered a replacement so we took it figuring this was a one off issue. BUT THE REPLACEMENT ALSO GOT LOST....\n \n  These were perfect and actually quite a bit cheaper than competitors I found. They seem pretty crush-proof (I sit in the ball pit with my daughter), the colors are fantastic and bright. I have zero complaints!\n \n  I bought the bag of 400 balls for a ball pit. They are perfect for toddlers! They don't crunch or squish at all. They're very durable for active kids. I have a 40 inch ball pit and it could probably hold about 800 balls. Well worth the money!\n ", "\n  The amount you get is worth the price tag and the balls get the job done. My toddler plays with them in her shallow play pool and tunnels while my newborn loves to swat at them with her palms.\n \n  Purchased the 400 ball pack for our toddler's birthday! He loves them.  They aren't hard plastic like the public ball pits but we haven't had any crushing issues yet.  I would purchase them again.  The diameter when read on the website seems small but they're actually perfect as our son is able to pick them up with one hand.  If they were any bigger he wouldn't be able to.  They also come in a mesh bag for storage if needed.\n \n  My 2.5 year old son loves these! He has sat on it and stomped on it multiple times, but it all still looks as new. These are very well made balls compared to others I have had in the past.\n \n  I am very happy with the quality. and this purchase.  I selected the 200 quantity which is a great value.  They are a nice size and sturdy for kids.  They are very crush proof and retain their original shape.  Expecting them to last a long time.\n \n  What's not to love? Every baby loves colorful balls to play with, and these are a great price. I was a bit worried that they would have a heavy plastic smell when they arrived, but luckily they didn't  (but I washed them anyways). Super easy to wash in the tub or washing machine.\n \n  Got these to fill up the ballpit and was 100# worth the money! My kids have spent countless Hours playing in it. They have been very durable and the colors matched exactly to what is pictured!\n \n  I really enjoy these balls for my little girls ball pit.  We ordered her a ball pit with balls for Christmas and I was so satisfied with my purchase in December that I recently ordered another 200 balls to make her ball pit more full.  They are true to color from the picture and are crushproof.  Some are less full than others and you can squish them but I can sit in the ball pit with my daughter on top of the balls and they do not flatten.  They are a great size and my 1 year old loves them!\n \n  My son absolutely loved these balls.  They\u2019re sturdy enough to last but soft enough not to hurt him.  Would highly recommend them to anyone.  One 400 count bag filled our son\u2019s inflatable toy.\n \n  These were a good deal for the price especially when i saw that the ballpit i wanted didn't  come with any balls. It came on time and my son is pleased (along with my chiuahua) to have them to jump into and throw around.\n \n  Excellent product for the cost! We wanted some balls for our one year old\u2019s birthday ball pit. He loves them and they\u2019re the perfect size. He can hold one in each hand but not too small that they\u2019re a choking hazard. 100% recommend.\n ", "\n  Great product, they feel really durable and the colors are bright and fun. My child loved them immediately when we added them to her play tent. She is 1 and they are a perfect size for her to pick up and throw around.\n \n  These balls are great! Both of my 1 1/2 \n  I bought these for my 15 month old son and was immediately impressed. They were delivered even sooner than the time given and come with a handy mesh container bag. This is great to use for when you need to clean them! I filled his normal sized pack and play and they covered 99% of the space. Crush proof is great because he has been rolling around on them all day and not a single one has \"popped\". Thinking of buying even more bags so he can hide!\n \n  We bought a ball pit separately and 200 balls, but needed more. Found these and was not disappointed! It comes in a cardboard box and the balls are inside in a mesh bag with zipper and handle. Would recommend!\n \n  I bought these balls recently for my niece and nephew to use in a ball pit that I had also bought them.  I wanted to give it a little time to see for myself how they liked them and I must say that they loved these balls!  They really like like getting buried in these balls and for their parents, myself, or anyone to create like a rumbling earthquake with all the balls flying around.  They are colorful, safe, not heavy so won't injure even a 1.5 year old.  I would definitely recommend these balls to anyone.\n \n  My daughter absolutely loved these balls we ended up ordering two 400 packs because she loved them so much. They are great for toddlers because it\u2019s soft material and it\u2019s not easily broken. She sometimes tries to bite them and surprisingly they don\u2019t break under her teeth. Easy to spot under the couch too.\n \n  These balls are awesome.  So far none of them have been smushed by my children.  I even joined in the fun and sat on some and was surprised I didn't deny or flatten them.  They're a little but smaller than the traditional ones u would have seen in a chuckie cheese ball pit but it's ok because they fit perfect in my kids little hands.  (ages 1 &2)  I would buy again for sure.\n \n  We only just got these, but my almost 13 year old and almost 11 year old played in them with their little brother, and all balls except for the two that the dog stole are whole and not crushed! So far very impressed! Some cheap, easy fun for all!\n \n  Just got this product today. The colors are truly beautiful but the balls seem smaller than what should be. I ordered the 200 count and it barely fills the ball pit so i would advise buying the 400 count.\n \n  The kids LOVE it. We originally bought 400 which wasn't enough so I bought 1600, which is what is displaced in the pic. Still had to buy more but all in all, the balls are excellent, and my kids love them! Definitely going to buy more for the bounce house and the outside playyard\n ", "\n  This is my second batch of these balls. We upgraded to a bigger ball pit and needed more so I ordered another 400! Will continue to order these every time I need more. Service as usual was amazing!\n \n  Balls arrived today and the box, mesh bag, and balls all wreaked of sewage. They literally smell as if they were soaking in a puddle of sewer water for days. I washed them with some bleach and soap, and they seem to smell a little bit better now. Definitely off-putting upon opening the box.\n \n  We had a soft cushion 36\" ball pit that we purchased these for. This is enough for almost two layers of balls which is perfect for our 12-month old. My 200+ lb husband laid on top of the balls and haven't crushed any of them. Our 12-month old will sometimes play with these by himself but loves it when playing with the balls with him. They are light so you don't have to worry if one was tossed at your one year old's face. Would recommend.\n \n  I love all the colors! They are soft enough not to hurt -- but durable to maintain the shape. My baby girl loves them!\n \n  I even counted every single ball and it was a perfect count. The bag that they come in is great too for storage. A 400 count of ball will fill one of those cheap plastic kiddie pools. Any thing less the 400 I think I would have been disappointed with.\n \n  I tried to smash these and could not. They are soft, yet durable and keep their shape. The varied color assortment is visually attractive. I highly recommend this brand and I will definitely buy more.\n \n  These balls are the smaller ball pit balls but are really great. We use them in a small blow up pool for our baby to play in and he loves them! They are easy for him to pick up and he lives the colors! They don't dent like some other balls which is great. I would say 200 will fill the bottom of a baby pool but if you want a bit deeper do 400. Great product!\n \n  I bought these for use in my in-home daycare, and the kids love jumping and playing in our inflatable pool ball pit! They've jumped in over and over again, and we've only had a couple of balls that were irreparably crushed.  Our kids give them 5 stars for fun!!\n \n  We were looking for enough to fill a ball pit at a reasonable price. These are great.  The baby did bite a couple with his teeth and they deflated,  but we figure that's collateral damage.\n \n  I ordered other balls that crushed within minutes of use.  These are perfect size and refuse to crush!  Love the colors as well.  Not the boring primary colors so they look great all over the floor! lol  They come in a mesh bag for easy storage.  Thank you for a great product.\n ", "\n  They\u2019re great for indoor ball pits. They\u2019re super light sooo they wouldn\u2019t work outside unless there\u2019s very little wind. We also found out they don\u2019t survive the clenches of Angry lawn mowers or teething puppies \ud83d\ude02\n \n  Finally after the first order got lost and seller made a replacement without any additional charge.. got it after 4 days. Nice color. My daughter love her pitballs.\n \n  Colors were great and the balls seem to be sturdy so far, but still have some give to them, so they didn't hurt when the children threw them at Grandma - yes, that happened.  The grandkids love the ball pit and the set of 400 was perfect.\n \n  I like the the feel of the balls, they have just enough give to them without collapsing in on themselves. My toddlers love jumping in them but best of all throwing them at each other, so they are soft enough that they don't hurt. we have only had them a couple of day so if I notice ant changes or issues, I will update my review.\n \n  There was a tiny piece of glass that came from these balls. My daughter cut her foot when she sat to play with them. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that this would be in a children\u2019s toy...\n \n  These are awesome! My daughter loves them. They are smaller than I thought they would be, though that could be bc I didn\u2019t read what the diameter would be. You would think 400 balls is a lot, but it\u2019s really not if you\u2019re getting them for a ball pit like I have shown in my picture. It only filled it up a quarter of the way. Overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase! Just wish you got more for what you pay for these!\n \n  The count was off...I would have been happier if they delivered the promised count. \n  Purchased 800 ,and fill about two layers of baby pop n' play. Bright color, light weight, smooth finsh balls, easy to clean ( threw them into the washer) mostly i like how they are not so staticky because i have a labrador retriever who sheds constantly.  Very satisfied\n \n  We got these balls on sale and they are awesome. We bought a ball pit and the 400 balls are just enough to fill it up and still have room to play. We might buy more just to have excess and extra, but this was a great deal.\n \n  We purchased several of these for a ball pit in the basement. The do not break and do not smell. Seem to be of very good quality.\n ", "\n  Just received them in the mail and my daughter loves them. They are good quality. For the amount of balls for the price they are really good! I love the zipper mesh bag they come in so if you don\u2019t have a ball pit to put them you can pick them up and put them away at the end of the day!\n \n  I was surprised seeing the smaller size of box they arrived in.  I did not count to see if all were there.. lol.  They have been sat on stepped on thrown and chewed on.  Have retained their shap\n \n  These balls are not too big and not too small. Great for the toddlers to play in. They are somewhat smaller than other types, so you may need more to fill a play area.\n \n  We got these for our sons 1st birthday this month and he loves them!!  Decided to take them camping with us to keep him busy & they hold up well!  Keeps him busy!  Love all the bright colors!!\n \n  I like them. They are fairly study. I wish they were just a tad more sturdy but the 2 year warranty helps make it worth it. One of the balls already squished up and lost air :/ also 600 balls is not a lot. Maybe if they were bigger.\n \n  My 1 year old son has loved playing with these in his pack and play.  They make the best at home ball pit.  They are durable and truly the colors are the best!\n \n  These balls are so much fun!  I dumped them out into a plastic kiddie pool and my baby had a great time!  The colors are bright and cheerful; they are not the typical blue, green and red; they are like spring colors with pink, yellow, lime green and turquoise.\n \n  I love that these play balls are non toxic! They are lightweight and easy for baby/child to hold, throw etc. No strange odors, and the colors are eye pleasing as well.\n \n  I ordered 400 I'm not suremof that's what I got and I don't have the time to count them. I think it is a great price for 400 balls though I would recommend and my son loves it!\n \n  my three boys love it! they play in the swimming pool with the balls all day! they love it! i will buy it again to get more ball to fill the swimming spool!\n ", "\n  I love the gender neutral colors. We got them within 2 days. They are big enough to not fit in my 1yr olds mouth. They are hard enough not to bend but not too hard to where it would hurt. And I love the bag they come in to store them. Very easy and convenient. I ordered (before these) from another brand and the sack they came in is a hassle plus its pretty sharp. So when I received these I was in so happy that I dont have to worry about my child getting hurt with the packaging.\n \n  These are thicker and more durable than what I had before but still fairly thin. Ball pit balls must be lightweight so they\u2019re always going to be possible to flatten with if you try- so don\u2019t!\n \n  This is a great value for your money! We bought 1200 balls total to fill DIY ball pit. Not only are they surprisingly strong and hard to flatten, they came with a warranty!\n \n  Exactly what I was hoping for. Other reviewers have mentioned these being smaller than standard ball pit balls, and that\u2019s true, but I like this size for for tiny hands. Love that they have a mesh bag for storage and cleaning.\n \n  These arrived fast!  The balls are bright, lightweight, and the perfect size for the play tunnel/tent we ordered at the same time. My 2.5 year old is having so much fun playing in and with these.\n \n  Bought 400 balls and so far only one has deflated (due to a cat sticking its claws in it). We put her fisher price slide down into it and it\u2019s a hit. The ball pit itself is a mesh small animal enclosure that looked very similar to the mesh ball pit for kids (but it was cheaper ). Overall good quality\n \n  These are great balls. They actually are crush resistent as advertised. My 300 pound fiance stood on one and it didnt crush it or dent it. I have two toddlers that play with then constantly and theyre still holding strong. Also a great value for the money these were the cheapest ones we could find.\n \n  800 balls......well NO.  my husband and I both counted them.  We counted 427.  Shows 2 bags and we only received one bag that had 427 balls......very disappointed  \ud83d\ude15\n \n  Since we are limited on our outings to the parks and our children's favorite places, we are bringing some of their favorite toys to our home and backyard.  The children love the balls.  No amount of money can buy their laughing smiling faces. \n  I did a lot of searching on amazon to find the best quality and here it is! I put these to the test by sitting and stepping on them, and they don't get crushed! Perfect sized for an infants hand too.\n ", "\n  Incredibly easy to destroy. My dog and 10 month old daughter have no problem crushing one with one bite, and I collapsed one just by picking it up quickly. You get a lot though so it still seems worth it.\n \n  Purchased these for a ball bit for our grandson and they are perfect for his little hands. They are a thinner plastic then I thought)easy to crush) but still pleased with the purchase.\n \n  I bought this product to go with the toddler ball pit ( for my ferrets) they absolutely love it the balls are sturdy enough to hold but not hard enough to hurt ....however they do have sharp teeth and love to carry and steal everything they have been able to put holes in a couple but still so worth every penny and I\u2019ll be buying more as want to see the reaction to even more balls \n  Amazing fun. Great toy for toddler. My son spent hours playing inside. Overall quality is good. Worth every penny. Recommend to all toddler's parents!\n \n  These are great- I got them for my baby who is under one years old, so she was the tester! The only thing you should know is- the bag fits the quantity exactly, so that makes it difficult to pour the balls back in. I just substituted a much larger bag, and that problem was solved.\n \n  Purchased for a little canine enrichment during the hot summer months. They\u2019ve lasted much longer then we expected with two crazy dogs. Worth every penny!\n \n  My kids wanted an indoor ball pit. 200 doesn't get you very far, so we'll be ordering more for sure. Seem like good quality and easy to clean. Will be used for a while!\n \n  I bought these for my two year old boy's ball pit which he loves to play in. \n  what a great value! these balls are way better than the ones i bought from target, they really are crush proof!! and the colors are awesome, i made a ball pit in a pack n play and it was the best gift ever!!\n \n  These balls are great quality and at a great price point. I ordered the 400 pack and they have been great for my little ones - they LOVE them. I would definitely purchase these in the future. I am thinking about getting them as a gift for my nephew (along with a ball pit) for Christmas!\n ", "\n  This was a great buy and great value for the cost. Came timely and had awesome colors. Perfect for what I needed them for ( bouncy castle) and pop up tent. \n  these are colorful and sturdy. Used them in a tent for make shift ballpit, bathtub and swimming pool. They don't have a gross plastic smell and have held up to 2 toddlers!\n \n  Definitely very low quality. They are all different thickness and some are lighter than others. Doubtful that kids jumping around on them won\u2019t ruin most of the 400.\n \n  We ordered 2 of the 400 packs. They were different  shades but same colors which was kind of a bummer since we ordered at the same time to avoid that. Only had 1 ball that was crushed on arrival and none have crushed during play. Great size!\n \n  I\u2019d say these are as good as you\u2019ll get for a ball pit ball. They\u2019re soft and squishy enough but also quite sturdy. Great size too. Good value for money when you compare it to your other options.\n \n  I built a yard-sized game and these balls were not only a great value but they look great, they're tough, and hold up well. Nice size, very good color saturation - they really made the perfect finishing touch.\n \n  I was surprised to see that I filled my whole Play pen for my little girl she\u2019s happy and I\u2019m happy with this product nothing bad to leave here :)\n \n  Best balls and buy you'll ever find! Needing to fill our new ball pit and shopped around for the best price/quantity and this did NOT disappoint. Smaller than some of the others weve bought but more sturdy which is better since they dont smash while playing in them. Will definitely be purchasing more and highly recommend to others.\n \n  I liked how the play balls were packaged and that they were conveniently in a mesh bag. They were very easy to clean because there were not any holes. I put them in the tub with baby dish wash soap. Compared to other balls I have received, these seem like they will hold up very well for the long term. I will definitely buy them again. Highly recommended!\n \n  Love these playballs! My son received A ball pit for his birthday but it didn\u2019t have enough of the playballs to fill it. I purchased these because they were the best value for the money, and I was not disappointed! Colors are vibrant, size is perfect and you can tell the material is thick and sturdy - quality product!\n ", "\n  I purchased 200 pick and play balls for the same amount I paid for 400 balance balls. Which means I paid double amount for pick , play. Besides the colors, the quality & size are the same.\n \n  My daughter loves these balls. They are small like her other balls and there are so many of them. I like the color variations and matches well with her ball pit.\n \n  Loved the amount I got for the cost. I don't expect these balls to be super durable like a tennis ball but my son and dogs love them and that's all that matters.\n \n  It definitely came shorter than 400. Didn\u2019t wanna be bother to pack them and send it back. The quality is so so.  There were few already broken.\n \n  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I bought a small blow up pool and 200 of these balls fit in the pool perfectly. My 8 month old LOVES her ball pit! They also shipped and delivered very fast. Would 100% order again if I needed more.\n \n  Exactly what I was looking for for the ball bit I got for my son. I like how it comes in storage bags so it\u2019s easy when rotating toys for my 2 yr old\n \n  my heavy handed 3 yr old nephew had ago first and was stomping and jumping into them to my surprise all still in great shape! im impressed!\n \n  Perfect for a ball pit! Bright colors! The balls are very durable and do not collapse! Highly recommend!\n \n  This is the 2nd time we have ordered these balls. Great price for the product. The only reason we ordered a 2nd time was because we lose them. Timely shipping on product\n \n  If you think you're getting a good deal because there are so many of them in the package... you're way off.  It will take at least two of these to get any decent level\n ", "\n  We have put some of these balls in their baths and kiddie pools to play with. Crush proof is correct. The colors are bright. They over all enjoy this product. Glad I purchased them. The only down side is the clean up. They roll, of course, so clean up isn't easy. Plus with COVID, I feel I need to sanitize them often.\n \n  These balls are the best deal!  The are much cheaper than others but the quality is wonderful!  The do not smash when children play or if sat on.  I have a 5 and 2 year old who get pretty crazy and have never had a smashed ball.  The storage bag is also very nice for when they outgrow the ball pit and we can store them away.\n \n  This product is great for my two year old daughter. She plays with them constantly and the quality is super. I find them every where as she likes to use them in multiple locations from her trampoline to her tent to the basket on her bicycle.\n \n  I am still working from home because of COVID and my son has been home with me too. He was getting so bored with his other toys. So I decided to make a ball pit. \n  The product is decent quality, but they shorted us 6 balls. It may seem silly to be bothered by that, but it feels like a rip off. You advertise 400, so you should send 400.\n \n  We received 1000 for a Christmas present and loved them so we bought 1000 more. Out of the 2000, we have had only 2 that have split apart. Great for our ball pit!\n \n  I got the 800 pack and am very happy, works out great and I have plenty for two of his tents with the tunnels. Easy for my baby to pick up, not to small.\n \n  The balls all can in great condition, not one was smushed. They feel hard enough to not be smashed but soft enough for my 6 month old. I ordered the 400 and they fit great in the bin I bought it for!\n \n  I got these to go in a ball pit play area I ordered for my son, was worried about him crushing them but they are almost indestructible!!  Went with the 400 pack and they fill up his ball pit perfectly!  They have a slight give to them so they are softer I guess you could say which is a great thing as they don't hurt him should he fall on them.  Great value!  Best price I have been able to find anywhere.  Will definitely buy more when/if needed.\n \n  Very sturdy and strong. Clean upon arrival unlike a few reviews I\u2019ve read. I\u2019d buy again. 200 doesn\u2019t look like very much btw. Go for 400 ct or more! I used these to turn a normal size pack and play into a ball pit and should\u2019ve bought 400.\n ", "\n  pretty sure there were NOT 400 balls in the package. Did I count them, no...but definitely not 400. The photo is all of them, barely covers the baby ball pit.\n \n  Bought the 400 pack and I am so pleased with my purchase! Has as already kept my 4yro and 6 month old super happy for hours of play!!!\n \n  These are awesome balls!!! They truly are crush proof! I tried really hard with my hands to crush one and it wouldn\u2019t budge, bounced back to its original shape quickly... this is a must with a ball pit!\n \n  You get alot of balls for the price which is great... however, they were played with for less than 20 mins and a ball was already cracked. Guess we will see how the rest hold up. \n  We found about 10 deformed balls that were made very awkward or that were crushed in.  Other than that the rest are awesome.  Mommy and daddy have sat on these balls and have not ruined them. Great deal!\n \n  The balls came quickly and 400 was the perfect amount to just fill the bottom of our little ball pit. It was perfect for our one year old's first birthday and he absolutely LOVES these. They are very bright colors and the perfect size for his little hands to easily hold and throw and roll around. He sits in his ball pit and giggles and pushes the balls back and forth happily. They were the best value for the money that I could find and I'm so glad I got them.\n \n  I bought these to go in a ball pit.  My soon has loved them.  We did have a ball that is a little flat.  Out of the number of balls and to have 1, that is do able.  Price was fair!\n \n  We needed to fill baby\u2019s ball pit we got for christmas and after going through many sites and seeing all the negative comments we found this one. We didn\u2019t want to pay so much money for plastic balls so we decided to order these and give it a try. We order the 400 pack and only 2 of 400 balls recieved were a bit deflated. They are sturdy enough to hold baby\u2019s weight and they are perfect for baby to grab on his own. Our mickey mouse ball pit filled up with the 400 but definitely would buy more when needed.\n \n  These are exactly what we were looking for.  They are durable enough to not smash but light enough that if they are thrown, they do not hurt the little one.  Would buy again.\n \n  I bought a $6 mini plastic pool and filled it with these balls for my 1 year olds bday and she absolutely loved it! She plays in it all the time and laughs like crazy. A very good buy!\n ", "\n  I filled up a foldable pool with these balls for them to play in.  My one ferret loses her mind when you roll them at her.  LOL.\n \n  Awesome price you get a bunch of plastic balls for a little price this are regular plastic ball not much to say about the quality like them so much\n \n  These are the most balls for the price, definitely best deal I found. Balls are sturdy, good for ball pit or bathtub. Exactly what I wanted!\n \n  The balls are just the right size for her 8-months-old hands. It's soft and doesn't have the plastic smell. It comes with a storage bag. I find it helpful. I just put the whole thing in a washing machine on the cold rinse cycle to give them a quick wash.\n \n  Ordered 400 balls and received 268 I am 132 balls short and I am not happy!! and the manufacturer is impossible to get ahold of. Number goes straight to voicemail. \ud83d\ude21\n \n  I was thinking it was a big ball, the balls are too small\ufffc ... They should make it more understandable for people\ufffc.  I was very disappointed !!! \ufffc\n \n  These balls feel like high quality material and appear to be very durable and sturdy. Only owned for a few weeks, but no issues so far and we think these will last for a long time. Good product!\n \n  My son is just in love with this we are using it for a sensory experience inside a playpen\n None None None \n  \u00a0They are small, sturdy little balls. My daughter loves playing in her ball pit with them. They come with a two year warranty so I'm impressed with the value for the money.\n \n  This product gets 5 stars! These balls are a nice size and are soft to the touch. They aren't a hard or stiff, if they are stepped on or squeezed they will bend without losing shape. I would highly recommend this product!\n ", "\n  These are great. Have had them set up for about a week and none have dented which said a lot considering my husband and I have launched them across the room at each other,  My 1 year old loves them too. Will likely order even more.\n \n  Everyone was right the balls are awesome the bag falls apart the minute you touch it pre-plan and have something else to store them in\n \n  These were exactly what I was looking for. A great amount (400 balls) for the price. After doing some research I realized I would need at least 400 to make the ball pit full enough to have a good time in. They came in a zipper tote which is great for storing. There was no strong plastic smell. And the colors are all vibrant and not the typical primary colors which I liked. They also seem to be upholding well, even with a busy toddler rolling around in them all day!\n \n  I bought these pit balls for my 3 yo granddaughter and my 2 yo grandson to play with when they're at my house. The kids put them in their little trampoline and roll on, step on, throw and lay all over the balls and they don't break! The kids play in their \"ball pit\" for hours and don't want to come out!! When I got the package, I didn't think there was 800 balls in there ( it seemed like a lot less) I counted them out and they're all there!\n \n  They're semi easy to crunch, but for the quantity and price I can't complain. They work perfectly for my daughter's ball pit, and she loves them!\n \n  As far as durability of a soft plastic ball that my kids are going to jump on and stomp, it's as expected. Has lasted so far. Best bang for your buck we've found. Love that it comes in a zippered reusable mesh bag\n \n  Bought the 400 ball and put them inside our playpen. My 18 month old loves them and will sit in there and play with them for a while.\n \n  My grandson loves playing with them inside and outside of his ball pit.  They fit in his 18 month little hands perfectly.\n \n  Balls are sturdy .I'm ordering more they don't fill in as much as one would think. So at least double the amount you believe you need.\n \n  I purchased other balls identical to these pit balls also from Amazon. I wanted to order more so I reviewed my previous orders. I started scanning comparable products and found these balls for approximately $20 less. These balls differ slightly in the color scheme but mostly the same. Same ingredients, same smooth side lines, same size. This product appears to be identical but were less money. Im pleased.\n ", "\n  My kids love these all that matters even tho they make a mess loool but yeah i have them inside a little house i got them! They call it the ball pit\n \n  I bought a pack of 400 of these plastic balls and they are good value for money. The colors are pretty and the plastic is flexible. I had previously bought balls from a different brand Click N' play, these are comparable in quality of those balls but are at lower price. Will update this review after a few months of use.\n \n  Not durable. I got these a few days ago for my 2 toddlers. These balls squish very, very easily and there's no recovering from the squish.\n \n  Granddaughters love them, really all that matters. It\u2019s like an Easter Egg Hunt cleaning up when they are done playing with them\n \n  I bought these as a birthday present for a friend's son. So far so good! They are withstanding cats and babies. Love that it comes in a reusable mesh bag so they have somewhere to go when it's time to put up the ball pit.\n \n  These balls are perfect size and really good quality. They don\u2019t crush. The colors are really nice and vibrant. I have already reordered more to fill my son\u2019s ball pit. Totally recommend and price per ball was way lower than other sellers.\n \n  My twins are obsessed with their ball pit. These balls are great. None of them have crushed, they've kept their shape perfectly. Also great price\n \n  Good size bag and colors are great but several arrived dented. Would have been perfect to use in inflatable pool.\n \n  We bought these balls for a kiddie pop up tent to use like a \"ball pit\". Our kids love them. We are very happy with the quality and our baby loves the bright colors. They arrived quickly in reusable packaging so we can store them away when we are done using them.\n \n  They are smaller than I thought they would be, which is fine. They work fine for what I am using them for. They can get crushed though,  but for the most part they bounce back up.  The colors are bright.\n ", "\n  I purchased that octagonal playpen for 3 of my grandkids and it\u2019s really big. I bought a total of 2000 of these balls.  Instant ball pit!! Winner!!\n \n  Love these! I ordered the 400 pack and it was perfect. I will definitely be ordering more when my kids are older and will want a filled to the top ball pit. Bright colors and awesome quality. I love the smaller size so they can hold them easily.\n \n  We bought these to go into our Utex tent ball pit. At first we were not sure if the amount would be too much or too little, but 400 is the perfect amount for us. Our little one is under a year so this amount works well. The balls are clean, sturdy, has no sharp seams or anything. We love the product. We especially love that it came with a bag to hold all of the balls. Definitely recommend purchasing this!\n \n  Great pit balls, my 2 years old boy jumps on them and they are sturdy, not one broken or bend. I will update if something comes up. For now they are great, pretty colors, soft.\n \n  Encantada con esta compra, los colores son muy bonitos y vienen con una malla muy convenientes para guardarlas.\n None \n  So glad I found these! I purchased this bag of 400 balls for my son's ball pit, and their perfect! Love the bright colors, the sturdiness of the balls, and their size is also perfect for a pit. The 400 fills our pit about 1/4 of the way. Our son LOVES them.. we may order another bag to add to the fun! Delivery was seamless with my order through amazon. Comes in a mesh bag, which is also awesome for storage/moving/cleaning.\n \n  The balls are a little smaller than I expected but they are excellent quality and come with a 2 year warranty. Very pleased, packaged nicely.\n \n  Perfect amount for a 47 x 47 x 30.7 inches ball pit and a 6-12 month old. I will buy another pack of 400 when the baby is 18-24 months\n \n  I bought these for my 2 year old and 1 year old after they loved watching Blippy using balls like this on Amazon Video. They love them. We bought a little pool as seen for them to play in. The balls do appear to be crush proof. My husband and I tried squeezing them and they seem soft but firm. This was a great purchase and you won't be disappointed.\n \n  Great balls to make use in a ball pit! My niece was more than thrilled to find her little tent to full of so many brightly colored balls. They are sturdy and have held up to adults sitting on them too. We actually bought this set plus another pack of 400 in a different color scheme to add to her existing 200 balls :)\n ", "\n  Was looking to make a ball pit for my 1 year old due stay-at-home order and having to spend more time indoor. These balls was among the best reviewed and was also the cheapest. I purchase the 800 ball set and was not disappointed. Balls return quickly back to shape after being crushed. Color is vibrant. No weird smells. Note that I received one bag with 800 bags instead of 2 bags of 400 balls each like other reviewers.\n \n  We like these. They were inexpensive and came in a zippered bag so can be put away when we are ready. They fit perfectly in our ball pit for our 1 year old. They, so far, are crush proof and can withstand our dogs stealing them on occasion. They fit well in our daughter's hands. She can pick them up, throw them, and even try to chew on them.\n \n  These balls were the cheapest I could find. I was worried they wouldn't have much quality to them but I was happily surprised by how nice they were when they arrived. We ended up ordering 800 more!\n \n  This is worth every cent I paid on it. My one-year-old has had hours of fun in the ball pit. It has been me have had so much fun with her to having a ball pit throwing fights. It is just the right amount to fill two of my ball pit. Even my dog enjoys it and she doesn\u2019t even puncture the balls\n \n  These balls are great. They are bright, colorful and sturdy. We put these in our pack and play for the kids to play in and they love it. Only thing is they love to throw the balls out, so be prepared for picking up lol.\n \n  It was great buying these for my nieces playground.  It comes in a bag that you can just add in to washer after kids are done playing, to make sure you keep them clean. They loved it and we literally counted all 400 balls. Kept them occupied for awhile lol\n \n  These are the perfect size balls for my grandkids ball pit!! The colors are bright and the balls are sturdy as well, the kids love them!!\n \n  Bought these for my one year old son and I'm pretty happy with them! The colors are super fun and the quality feels great! He already had some other ball pit balls from another brand that got crushed easily.. these are much nicer! They also come in a nice mesh bag that will make them easy to store! I did think 400 balls would look like more than it actually does but that may be because the balls are a little smaller. The smaller size is perfect for his little hands though!\n \n  600 nice ball pit balls in perfect condition! They look nice and feel nice. And seem like they wont crush! I tested one and they pop right back.\n \n  These are a great buy! Lots of good quality balls at a good price. My kids have been rough with these but so far they have not lost their shape.\n ", "\n  Wonderful product. Bought two bags of 400 for my babies birthday party. I love the bag that comes with it so that the balls can dry after washing and disinfecting.\n \n  Very good quality. No strong chemical smell and only two defect balls out of 400. Over my expectation.\n \n  I love these and the kids do too :)  I paid 30.00 for 200 at first through a different company on here and they came with no BAG :( then i dumped them in and needed WAY WAY more so i found these!! OMG they come in a awesome reusable bag and they are a just a hair bigger and the colors are vibrant!! I ended up ordering 2 bags of these 400ct and will recommend these!!\n \n  I need to order another set! The colors are so vibrant and gorgeous, balls are sturdy and filled nicely. This is a 400ct ... another 500 should do it lol\n \n  Great price compared to similar items. Very sturdy, my 17 month old rowdy toddler has not been able to crush these things yet. I used on a small ball pen from hide n side with 600 balls, half way full.\n \n  I purchased these for my 2 year olds ball pit. She loves them. For the price you can't beat it and they're also a good quality. These are also not easy to crush and hold up great! Definitely would purchase again.\n \n  Purchased the 400 pack and they are PERFECT !! Perfect amount and very sturdy , very bright and colorful and the bag it comes with is awesome. Very happy with this item.\n \n  Altho it took FOREVER to get my package (even tho I was told it was \"in stock\", I am happy with the product so far.\n \n  We purchased the 600 count which came in one large mesh bag. We put them in our Intex toddler size bounce house and they cover the base of it plus a little extra. Our 2 year old very much enjoys them and has been working on pushing the limit of their durability. They are holding up well. The colors are also bright and fun.\n \n  These are very very nice, durable, and soft at the same time.  This is my 3rd order for balls and these are my favorite.  Colors are gorgeous and they arrived very bright and shiny.  Packaging was very nice too.  Definitely worth spending the money for these!\n ", "\n  I am completely satisfied with these! Such a great value for the price and I\u2019ve had no problem with them getting crushed or messed up. Before we put them in our ball pit I washed them straight in the bag on the delicate wash cycle and they came out perfectly! My 10 month old has a blast with these! Happy baby, happy mom :)\n \n  Wonderful. I count them and I received 400. 67 blue, red, orange, pink and green. 65 yellow balls.\n \n  We bought the pack of 600 balls for our 1 y/o daughter's new ball pit (4 feet x 4 feet). The balls are fill the pit up to about 1/3 full. Thinking about buying another pack of 600 just to overflow that ball pit! Wife loved the color of the balls, commented how much better they look than the darker colors we saw in the McDonald's play pits when the still existed.\n \n  My 1 yr old granddaughter and 7 yr old granddaughter love these balls. The 7 yr old jumps in it and all is good - I was afraid the balls would smash or brake but no they are taking a beating \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Having a great time ! \n  Did not receive the stated \"1,000\" balls but rather 1,011. Slightly disappointed in the miscounting. Only one of the ball has a large puncture hole. \n  My baby who is 10 months loves the balls, even when he is not in his ball pit he will still want to carry a few with him around the house. \n  Great value. We through this in my 5month old\u2019s inflatable pool and she loves it. The balls are a perfect size for her to grab and the colors are vibrant and make it easy for us to teach her the colors. Overall great product!\n \n  These are awesome. I got the 400 and it's not enough for what I need though.  They're solid enough and my daughter loves them :)\n \n  The biggest difference between these balls and other balls is that these really don't get smooshed down like others do. Otherwise, they are the normal balls you'd see in a ball pit\n \n  The balls for our ball pit came in a zip up nice mesh bag and were as described! They will be perfect for our boys on Christmas morning!!\n ", "\n  These are great! They are good quality and the storage bag is very nice and super convenient! Love this.\n \n  Love these and so does my son. He is 7 months old and is having a ball playing in his play pin with these! Will have to order him more as he gets older to fill it up a little more!\n \n  Even though it took 30 days for me to receive my order, the wait was well worth it. My son now has a ball pit in his blow up bounce house and he loves it! I'm thinking about placing another order for 400 more balls to fill it up even more! The bag that it comes in is also great for when you need to put the balls away for storage.\n \n  My toddler loves these balls! She can sit and play in her little ball pit without any of them getting crushed. Nice bright colors and comes in a mesh bag with a zipper for storage.\n \n  These went great with a ball house we purchased. They didn\u2019t crush under pressure from 1yr old twins and a 4yr old.\n \n  My kids love to play in their playpen with these balls! These balls are probably one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon. I only ordered 200 because I was scared at first they wouldn't be good. But they are the best. They are average size and very sturdy! Will be purchasing more asap!!!\n \n  I bought these for our grandson who is 11 months. They are the perfect size for little hands but not too small. They are smooth and do not have any little snags or barbs unlike other balls I have purchased in the past. They are sturdy, durable and I love the colors. I was impressed by the price for the amount of balls.\n \n  Great value for your money, your little one will have hours of fun playing in heir very own ball pit!  Great size for grasping (definitely improves motor skills), soft yet durable.

Even came with a 2 year warranty!\n \n  I bought these for my 1 year old. He loves them.  The size of the balls are perfect for him to grab them and the colors are so bright that quickly get his attention. Keeps him (and my 7 & 13 years old daughters) entertained for hours. The price is great for everything you get.  Will definitely get more soon.\n ", "\n  Colors are vibrant! This is 200 balls in the pit will definitely buy more. Very sturdy! I have bought other ball pit and they are easily smashed but these are firm.\n \n  All 400 balls were there yes I counted. Very durable I sat on the balls as well as other. Definitely crush proof.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n None None \n  \u00a0Este producto cumplio con mis expectativas, son colores brillantes y su textura es lisa sin peligro de algun rasgu\u00f1o para mi bebe. Son suaves y lo que me encanto de ellas es que no se aplastan como otras que anteriormente e comprado. Excelente compra y a mi bebe le encantaron.\n None \n  Really liked the bright colors which are very kid friendly.  The balls aren't too hard to hurt anyone, especially as young kids like to throw them at each other.  Highly recommend this item with good value for money.\n \n  I searched amazon for balls for a birthday party ball pit, I didn\u2019t want to spend too much money bc I knew the kids were going to play hard. This was the most amount of plastic balls for the least amount of money. Also, it comes with a mesh bag which perfectly fits all the balls and the collapsible tent piece for storing in the basement!\n \n  These balls are great. Light weight but durable and sturdy. My 5 year old and 1 year are famous for putting toys to the test for their durability and these definitely pass the test with a highly recommended stance!\n \n  They crush very easily, but work for what I got them for. \n  I bought these for my toddler\u2019s ball pit. 1000 was definitely a few hundred too many, but it was worth it when I poured the bag on him in the ball pit. He loved it and his ball pit is probably his favorite toy. I\u2019m sure over time I\u2019ll appreciate having extra balls.\n \n  Mine was short 110 balls. I\u2019m not sure if they think people won\u2019t count because there\u2019s so many but I did and I ordered 400 balls not 290. I bought these for a gift so that\u2019s not ok and there\u2019s no time now to order enough to cover the floor of the ball pit. On top of that these are tiny and are not as big as described.\n \n  Great value for the money. Received quickly and they are perfect for the purchased ball pit. My nephews love them.\n ", "\n  Wow what a great product! The colors are vibrant and beautiful. The quality is great and my son absolutely loves it! Will definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great way to distract the kiddos!\n \n  These arrived quickly, are exactly the way they are described. They feel crush proof, are smooth, have no weird smell, and the colors are great.\n \n  Piece count is shorter than advertised. Attempting to get the correct/supplementary amount sent as i am doing a project with my kids. Tried to contact seller's report, but mailbox is full. Looks like I have to ship back the whole thing.\n \n  Just what I was looking for to fill the ball pit for my 2 year old. Wish I would have bought 2 of these though.\n \n  Bought this for my one year old as she was given a ball pit with no balls and she loves them. They are bright and sturdy with no issues.\n \n  I bought these to fill a small ball pit for a baby whose mom is very germ conscious.  The balls are bright and clean and have no odor at all. Baby loves them, mom is happy. Success!\n \n  Bought these for our 10 month old granddaughter. We put them in a large box and dropped her in. She squealed and squealed. The balls seem to be of good quality and we are going to pull them out when we need to entertain her.\n \n  Ordered these play balls / pit balls for my 2-year-old daughter.  She has played constantly with them!  And I have had the joyous task of picking them up throughout the house!  Even our cats have batted them around as a toy.

I will definitely be ordering more.\n \n  Love the little case that comes with it and the balls seem durable. I'm one happy mama\n \n  Love these pool balls! Nice quality and variation of colors. Good size and durable. My son loves playing with them. Would buy again and again! (Tips: 400 balls don\u2019t seem that many. You may want to buy at least two sets of 400 counts unless you have a very small pool size)\n \n  Very durable. Two kids and one adult jumped on it for one month and just had two balls of the 400 had some dints. Very good!\n \n  They were just what I was looking for to fill my daughters all pit.  Could have used 2 bags though\n \n  This is a wonderful amount of balls for the money, and they are very durable. 400 is more than you think it is too! Hopefully they will last a long time with a toddler!\n \n  LOVED these ... I have bought many of these types of balls in the past\u2026 Not necessarily this brand & they have crushed\u2026 These really have not & they pop right back up. The only way they have been destroyed was buy our \u2018LABS\u2019 who INSIST that they are theirs \ud83d\ude44\n \n  Worth the buy. Soft for our baby but durable. They didn't smell which is a plus. They came in a netted bag.\n \n  Overall we love the balls . But there was lose sharp plastic when I pour them into the ball pit. My 2 year old found after stepping on it .\n \n  These mixed nicely with the balls we already had. My kids smash them a lot, but they pop back easily & don't look too mangled.\n ", "\n  Great product, big size, sturdy, fills up the ball pit well, and on the better side of the price options\n \n  Great balls to fill our girls ball pit.  Bright colors and durable while still being soft enough to play rough in.\n \n  Very good quality. I purchased these for a small ball pit for my 1.5 year old. They are a sturdy material, good size for his hands to grip and I\u2019m very satisfied with the purchase. 400 sounded like quite a lot to me, but to give the ball pit a more full feel, I will need to purchase another 400.\n \n  These are awesome! The colors are even better in person. Balls are durable - they don\u2019t crush easily - which is great! Buy more than you think you need. We bought 400 and it looks like 100 in the ball pit.\n \n  They are perfect fit for my toddler\u2019s hands! She absolutely loves them. I love that. They\u2019re non toxic, and they\u2019re extremely sturdy and durable! It\u2019s all at a great price at that!

I recommend buying it.\n \n  We were looking for cost effective but durable balls to go in a ball pit we purchased for 2 year old twins. These work so well!

I also appreciate that it comes in a mesh zippered bag for storage with a handle.\n \n  These are great!!!! They are sturdy. They don\u2019t flatten easily and you get so many for the price.

Loves his ball bit and I can actually afford to get enough to fill it!\n ", "\n  Good quality,  good price.  They are soft enough that they have some give when squeezed,  but sturdy enough that they go back in place when let go. The colors are pretty too.\n \n  My girls love them. They are currently trying to get lost and go swimming under make believe water (balls) I squeezed one to see just how durable they are and to my suprise they are pretty darn resilient.

They are very easy to squeeze with very little pressure .\n \n  Great quality and so manmy. They're firm and colorful.

Hasn't ruined any!\n \n  I bought these to fill a baby pool for my daughter. It is fun for the pool when the weather isn\u2019t great for swimming. Nice and sturdy and fun colors!\n \n  Exactly as expected. Seem to resist crushing fine. Relatively thin compared to commercial ball pit balls, but they seem structurally sound regardless.\n \n  These balls are good quality. They hold their shape well. We used ours to make a ball pit. These are the best value we\u2019ve found thus far.\n \n  Just what I was looking for. 200 balls were enough to turn my little one's pool into a playground. The balls size is fine and the balls are soft but not enough to get demaged with the baby's weight. I am satisfied with this purchase.\n ", "\n  Great amount to play in ball pen. Good quality and fun colors. My 14month old loves to play in a pool of balls.\n \n  Perfect for a ball pit. A little on the small side (smaller than a restaurant play place), so it takes more of them to fill it up, but both my daughters love them and the fit perfectly in my one year old\u2019s hands. None have cracked or dented. Great quality and color vibrancy!\n \n  Bought to help fill my daughter's ball pit. These did the trick adding it with ball we already have. Nice colors.\n \n  These balls are pretty cheap compared to other companies with durable pit balls. I\u2019ve tried stepping on them and squeezing them, I\u2019ve even watched my son try to bite into them and they still held up great. They\u2019re a bit smaller than the ones you can buy at Walmart but they\u2019ll last a lost longer.\n \n  Just what I was looking for. Price was reasonable considering comparables.\n \n  Ordered 200 and am very satisfied with my order. The balls hold its form very well and the colors are very bright. My little girl loves picking them up and playing with them. Sometimes they get stepped or sat on, but the balls seem to hold their form pretty well. No discoloration and they are just the right size.\n \n  I bought these to fill up a little ball pit and they are absolutely great for just that. When the package arrived it came sealed in a protective manner which ensured no discrepancies would happen with the overall quality. I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about what balls to buy since they truly do ensure you are getting a valuable product.\n \n  Hi, \n  Love these balls! Beautiful bright colors that good up with a one year old boy.\n \n  Great value for the amount of balls. We used these for our kids' ball pit. The balls seem to hold up and not crush like other cheap brands.\n ", "\n  These balls are so great. I left them outside on our tramp and we had a random spring snowstorm. They were covered in snow and outside for a few days but the color is still vibrant and they\u2019re still as firm as when I got them. Very impressed.\n \n  These are great! Good size and seem pretty durable! No rough mold lines like some other brands. Going to buy some more!\n \n  Perfect ball pit balls. Nice bright colors. Have used them through 2 ball pits now. They don\u2019t collapse or squish down like some other thinner balls. Very sturdy. Obviously my 3 year old is happy with them as well. :)\n \n  When these did finally arrive to our home we immediately use them all of our three children love these in the ball pit they are very durable\n \n  The balls were sent in bulk in a mesh bag. We ended up with 380 balls, not 400. They are ok for a ball pit but they are very thin balls and smash easily.\n \n  These are exactly as pictured. Sturdy enough that the toddlers haven\u2019t smashed any yet!\n \n  This was just what we needed to make a ball pit for our one year old daughter. We filled an inflatable swimming pool with these balls and she had a blast! 400 was a good amount to fill the 4 foot diameter pool. Would recommend.\n \n  These balls are nice and sturdy. They fit perfectly in my son\u2019s hands. At first I didn\u2019t notice but after doing fun counting activity with my son, I found out that I received 395 balls. I think it could be a mistake but just a point. Otherwise these balls are good value for money.\n \n  I looked at way too many options for balls to put in my daughter's pack and play to keep her occupied while I work from home, and this seemed to be the best option. My package came today and I am so pleased! I got 400 for around $30 which is a great price point, the balls are beautiful, clean, and durable, and they came with a nice carrying bag. My daughter was thrilled and so am I! Definitely recommend.\n \n  Very nice, bright and soft balls. The size is good and its a good mix of colors.\n ", "\n  I purchased the 400 count, for play pit. All 400 balls fill in nicely.. they are beautiful colors and my toddler enjoys sliding down her slide, into the balls.. They don\u2019t hurt. You can squeeze them, without destroying them. I will probably purchase maybe 200 more.\n \n  Loved them so much I bough 400 more! (Used 800 balls in this ball pit & that seemed perfect!) Perfect size. Kids tried smooshing them & they held their ground. Zero complaints here! I\u2019d definitely purchase them again!\n \n  These are awesome! Filled up our bounce house nicely and looked good with some other balls that we already had in there. Might have to order some more.\n \n  I bought these along with a ball pit off amazon and honestly this was a huge hit for a one year olds birthday.  A little pricey to me for just plastic balls but the excitement on their faces at party was worth it.\n \n  Great addition to our bouncy house - 400 balls don't go as far as you'd expect, so we'll definitely be ordering more!  They are as advertised - satisfied with our purchase.\n \n  These balls are higher quality than others I have had.  Although they are slightly smaller, they are somehow softer because they bounce back and resist denting.  I bought these because they are non toxic.  We tried putting them in a plastic kiddie pool but they just popped over the sides so we put them in a pac n play and the kids love them!\n \n  Absolutely love these, much nicer than some of the previous ones I have ordered. The vibrant colors are great. My daughter loves them.\n \n  My one year son was so excited when he saw all the balls. He rushed in the ball pen and started rolling around in them. He is so happy (for the moment)!\n \n  These are tougher than other ones I've bought in the past, definitely worth it\n \n  Very durable, these balls are not ease to squeeze, which I love. My children cannot bite these balls either. ", "\n  These balls were awesome but I did not receive the amount of balls advertised. I tried to contact them but they were apparently closed.

Not all the balls are crush poof. a few feel flimsy.  Very disappointed to not be able to resolve the problem.\n \n  Great colors and work for both boys and girls! Order one more bag, than you think you need, to add more fun!\n \n  So I bought 150 from another brand.  It wasn't enough balls so I bought these.  I was thinking they were cheaper so they wouldn't be as nice but they would help fill up the pit. WOW ... not only were they cheaper but they were much nicer.  They didn't crush. Like, for real didn't crush!\n \n  Very good quality and color full, not too small. 400 just enough for my 10month old\n \n  Colorful and a good size for play.

Stronger, colors are great, we got the 400 count and it was perfect for our size ball pit!\n \n  Great product.

Will probably by a 2nd one for my house.\n \n  Balls were colorful and packed well! My 1 yr. old was pleased with just this package alone!\n ", "\n  So far so good, but just disappointing for it being Made in China.\n \n  The balls themselves are great, but the mesh bag, could be better.\n \n  Good price for the amount . They are good quality . None broke or got. Crushed so far\n \n  Great product for a great price. My grandson loves it. And they actually are crush proof. Endless hours of fun.\n \n  I used the pack of 400 to fill a hexagonal ball pit that is approximately 4 feet across. There are enough balls to give decent coverage, but I might be back for more to give the pit more depth.  The balls are sturdy and do not crush easily, unlike some other balls we've had in the past. The colors are vibrant. The kids love playing with them.\n \n  We absolutely love these! Shipping was fast and came sooner then expected. The plastic balls are durable and perfect for our baby in his ballpit. The price was affordable and worth it.

I love the bag that comes with them for storage purposes when not being used.\n \n  We got these balls for a blow-up water slide that can be used wet or dry.

Our son loves them too, & it\u2019s great they can withstand a toddler!\n \n  They are soft enough so as the kids can play and strong enough to be durable\n \n  I bought these after buying other another brand that was terrible. These are great! Although they are not fun to pick up they are safe and a great quality.\n \n  These balls are definitely worth the money. Even after stepping on a few of them accidentally, they did not pop or crack or break.\n \n  That are quite small but generally not bad product.\n \n  So glad I purchased these! I had bought a ball out that didn\u2019t include balls. These are just what I was looking for. I have to say though if you have a dog that sheds like crazy like us, these balls are a magnetic cling! Everyone of them has dog hair on them. Just a warning.\n ", "\n  Perfect for what was needed but extremely pricey.\n \n  Bought these for my kids to play in the ball pit and they\u2019re having so much fun with them.

Nothing to dislike but love the colors and durability.\n \n  It's exactly what we needed, but there was a strong chemical smell that still hasn't gone away!

Smaller than normal, but for a toddler they are perfect fit for those little hands\n ", "\n  Got these balls for our 1.5 year old daughter's ball pit (kiddie size blow up pool) and she loves them!

I have so many friends who have little ones and will recommend these to them.\n \n  If anyone wants pit balls I highly recommend this item.

And fast delivery as well.\n \n  These showed up quickly.  The colors are bright and 400 balls filled up the baby ball pit perfectly.

My first grader sat in the ball pit and the balls crushed immediately. Not worth the money\n \n  Exactly what was stated.  I\u2019m happy that the balls came in one large mesh container which was very helpful. \n  We purchased two of these 800 count ball sets to fill our inflatable pool and turned it into a ball pit, which our son loves!

We even recommend them to our friends. These are really for kids of all ages.\n \n  Says 400count received less than 200count!

My mother n laws dog did get ahold of one and it didn't last 10 seconds. I got what I purchased and am really happy with the product.\n \n  Positives are that the balls are great quality and really easy for my baby to play with. Negative is that they took over 2 months to arrive and when they did we were 21 balls short of the 400 ordered. Kind of disappointing.\n \n  What can I say, it\u2019s 400 balls. Arrived within a couple of days from ordering. Washed them in a bathtub and they\u2019re good to go. Does what it\u2019s suppose to do, which is to keep an infant distracted.\n \n  Great balls for my kids ball pit. The best part about these balls were that they are the cheapest ones out there and came with a storage bag.\n \n  Bought my first bag of these 2 years ago and they've held up great.  My kids love them, they are the perfect size and have yet to crush a single one.  Just bought my second bag to be able to fill up an even bigger ball pit.\n \n  The bright colors are very appealing to my grandsons. The balls didn\u2019t crumple when they were stepped on. I ordered 400 and it was just the right amount for our ball pit. They are well worth the money.\n \n  I\u2019m really happy with this purchase.

On top of that my niece and I squish the balls with all our might and they do not loose there sturdiness so you will not have the worry about the being squished !

It was but these are noticeably smaller than the ones at the store.  Those measure a little over 27 inch circumference which is 8.5 inches.  These measure 24.50 inch (generously inflated) which is only 7 3/4 inch.  It is a huge difference in size vs a true 8.5 inch ball.  Dissapointed.\n \n  These are perfect for my 4th grade class to play with at recess. My kids play four square a lot, and they all fight over these balls vs. the regular kickballs the school lets us use. I have only added air to one of them since I bought them and the kids are pretty rough with them. Very happy with this purchase!!\n \n  I bought these to put in my Operation Christmas Child boxes knowing that balls are a huge hit but I can't pack an inflated one!  These were perfect.  They fit in the box super well, I was able to find more pumps at Dollar Tree and put them in with the ones that didn't have a pump (sent the one that came with it in one of the boxes).  They are very well made and I'm hoping that they are being enjoyed.\n \n  Basic playground balls. Comes with pump and two extra needles. Pump has a place to store a needle which is quite handy. \n  These balls inflated very easily with the pump to 8+inches. I inflated mine to 10\u201d each, using just one of the the THREE included nozzles for all four balls. I am saving the extra nozzles for air refills, as needed. Re: size: my hands are 7\u201d fingertip to palm*.\n \n  I read a bunch of reviews saying these balls were smaller than advertised or different sizes. Simply false. You have to inflate them correctly. Everyone who said they are too small just didn\u2019t pump them up enough.\n \n  Great playground balls purchased for our locale school's playground.  The yellow ball was a good 1.5 inches smaller than the rest of them. I sent an email to the seller, with no response.\n \n  These look like they will hold up well. Perfect size and the pump is an added extra. I love the colors and think they will bring a lot of joy to the kids I am sending them to. These will go into Operation Christmas Child shoe box donations for needy kids around the world. I am glad they came un-inflated because I need them to fit in a shoe box. I bought some extra pumps as each ball will go to a different child. They are super sturdy and just the right size, so glad I found these!\n \n  The ball quality is very good and they bounce well, however, they are not that big.  They are much smaller than your average kickball and even a small person can handle them with one hand.  When I measured them I feel that they are more of a 7 inch diameter when blown up.  The kids did not like using them for kickball because they were too hard to handle, we will try them for dodge ball though but I am not sure if they will work out for that game either.  I can't imagine them being used for 4 square even with much older kids, they are just too small.\n \n  The four colors are nice so each player in a game can easily identify their ball. The texture and strength of the balls is good quality. We play \"tree ball\" and \"saucer ball\" and other games with them. In tree ball they bounce of trees well and we play a number of kicks to strike a sequence of trees. In saucer ball we use circular snow sleds and the goal is to be the first to kick the ball so it lands in the saucer, similar to golf. They work wonderfully for this.\n ", "\n  Our daughter loves them very much. Very bouncy colorful balls. Sadly the green one came damaged, the air is coming out as soon as we take out the pump. But other three are great. Also red one seems to be just a tiny bit smaller than the others, but that doesn\u2019t really bother any of us. Overall they look very neat and bright. For now quality seems to be good. I would definitely recommend these even in spite of the defect of the green one. Well come on, mistakes and defects happen, but the quality is till very nice. Even with the flaw we have three absolutely satisfying balls less then 5 bucks each. And a pump. Totally worth the money, if you ask me.\n \n  Awesome for the price! \n  I inflated one of the balls the first day they arrived which held for about 6 hours before it started leaking around the inflation hole. When I reinflated it it immediately went back to leaking and deflated. I have now inflated a second one being very careful to insert the inflation needle straight into the center of the inflation hole and now, less than 3 hours later it has already lost some of it's inflation. These balls all say they were part of batch S18 so maybe S18 was just a bad batch...?\n \n  Ordered this for recess time. Came with a pump. Red, yellow and green balls worked fine. Blue ball immediately (and audibly) began to deflate once the pump was removed. Was able to get the hissing to stop but by next day, the ball was shriveled up again. Initiated a return via amazon.com and received shipping label for return. Dropped off the package at UPS store without hassle and refund was issued electronically shortly after UPS accepted the box. Colors were vibrant and kids liked them. Because return was fairly hassle-free (other than having to make a special trip to the UPS Store) we will re-order again with the hope that there will be a better outcome with next set of balls.\n \n  I love that I can re inflate them. They are out in the TX heat and will lose their air, but they have lasted along time and have held up to my 3 year old grandsons.\n \n  They are not the exact same as the ones the kids have at school, but they are perfect for my family. They bounce great, easy to inflate, and the kids are enjoying them. Once inflated, they were/are of slightly different sizes (not by a lot) but they feel equally inflated but are slight variation. Not complaining, just was surprised.\n \n  Good balls for the money...for what I paid I was not expecting much but they are definitely a good deal.  They are NOT 8.5 inch as stated but were around 6-7 inches when inflated.  Great for games involving some type of throwing.\n \n  These are the best. Colorful as the picture, easy to inflate and sturdy. Bought them for my sons birthday party and the kids (9 or so 10 year olds) threw them all over the park, climbed on them and fought over them and they withheld it all and he still has all 4. Great deal and just like a real dodgeball should be. I would get again if I actually had use for 4 more dodgeballs\n \n  One ball had a hole in it and could never be filled. Another would fill but not hold air for long. The other two were non-usable after one weekend of light play. The quality was so lousy that my 8 year old (unprompted) said that I needed to send the balls back. Unfortunately I did not.\n \n  These are fantastic! The material is thick and durable. It comes with 4 balls (deflated), a pump and 3 stems. Super easy to inflate - in fact, my 5 year old and 2 1/2 year old inflated them all by themselves. They are 8.5\u201d in diameter, so smaller than a standard kick ball/dodge ball. But perfect for kiddos. What a great value as well! Super happy with this purchase!\n ", "\n  Perfect for my 1 1/2 year old. He loves to kick and throw these. We got them as a good way to start teaching him colors, and overall I am pleased. We have had them well over a month now, and only 1 has popped, and even that was due to the fact that the dog got a hold of it. Good value\n \n  Couldn\u2019t get this product to inflate to full size.  Returned and spent more money for one good quality ball.\n \n  Review from a 9-year-old user: \n  These are great for dodgeball!!! This is my second time buying these balls. We bought a bunch of these and some smaller ones. They hold up well. Just be cared when filling them up. If your needle is dry, it can puncture the ball and make a hole. I suggest licking the pump needle and then pumping up the ball (if you don\u2019t think that is gross\ud83d\ude02).\n \n  I purchased these 4 balls to teach Pre-K students how to play two-square. They have been great! They are lightweight, which is perfect for this age. They love the bright colors and can catch the balls easily. They might be a little too lightweight for older children.\n \n  We bought two orders of balls for our non-profit program. They are very useful and are not that hard where someone may get hurt. These are perfect for dodge ball, kickball, and bridge ball. The colors are also very vibrant and pretty. They bounce very well and it was easy to inflate. The material is shiny and seems very durable.\n \n  Vibrant colors. Super sturdy. Great bounce. Textured for easy handling. \n  These balls hold up where others fall flat. We were replacing a ball that deflated after a short time of use. Not these balls. Great value for the product. 4 balls and a pump. No way.\n \n  They all inflated fine and held air. Very sturdy balls. would recommend.\n \n  Survived for a month and still using the first one. I had many many Voit and way too many mikasa balls not last even a few days without going flat. Almost gave up on this style of ball but my daughter loves 2 square and these are perfect and seem the most durable we\u2019ve ever had.\n ", "\n  Glad to have a free pump out of the deal here. I feel like these are made cheaply. Says May 2018 Made in China. Let's see how long it lasts. Haven't used them yet.\n \n  These were perfect for my grand kids ages 5,2,2.  The pump worked great.  You could split the package up and give as gifts to four kids.  Mine are staying at my house for next time when we need some outdoor time.\n \n  Bought these for my ball crazy dog.  She LOVES THEM!  And, unlike other balls I've purchased for her in the past, she hasn't been able to pop any of these (and I don't think she will either).  We love taking them to the dog park too.  We'll kick them across the entire fenced area and she will run and chase them like crazy.  Thanks for the hours, and hours, and hours of enjoyment she gets out of them.\n \n  Exactly what I needed. Like other reviews, the balls are slightly smaller than advertised, but the kids don\u2019t mind in the slightest. Colors are bright and wonderful, and the quality is top shelf. :)\n \n  Great set of colorful balls.  Easy to pump with the included ball pump.  Perfect size for lots of backyard fun.  Durable with the exception of dogs with teeth ........... not much can be done with that.  :)  Highly recommend.  Great product.  Great price.\n \n  Pumped these up and blasted my 2 year old with them. Kid is TERRIBLE at dodging, and don\u2019t even get me started on his catching skills.\n \n  Pin separated from pump in second ball (wont go back), ball wont hold air within a week.\n \n  Not filmsy, this is a stout ball you can kick, bounce, or throw. Well made - kids even float on them in the pool.\n \n  Great for PT use at home and solid enough that even when the dogs got a hold of these one day they came out okay.\n \n  These are a good deal for what you get, however, keep in mind that this is not the size of a regulation size kickball (those are 10\"). Also, these feel like cheaper rubber than some of the more expensive balls I've gotten in the past. Though, these held up during a heavy weekend of dodge ball with 80+ people!\n ", "\n  The pump didn\u2019t the exact peace at the top so I can pump the balls wasn\u2019t able to use them  still in box\n \n  definitely worth it.  it came with a pump and it wasnt hard to get it inflated.  my daughter loves them!\n \n  These don't pump the right size, they're very oblong not a good shape for playing with, very poor quality. Crappy product. Just buy balls at Fred Meyer, Costco, or somewhere like that if you can.\n \n  These take abuse well.  Thick walled, good fill needle hole.  Stretched a couple of them out to 10\".\n \n  Exactly as advertised.  No complaints.  Would buy again.  Came with (3) air needles as well - which is great because it took my 6 year old about 10 seconds to break 1 while trying to \"help\" fill up one of the balls (but that is NOT a product issue......that's a 6 year old boy issue)  (-: \n  Perfect outdoor bouncy balls. Great bounce. Easy to inflate, love that it comes with a pump and extra needles.\n \n  3 BOYS IN THE HOUSE. AGES 1 to 9 AND WE ALL REALLY LOVE THESE. UOU DO HAVE TO PUMP THEM, but it comes with everything you need. Pump and needle.\n \n  I was surprised with these because of how low the price was. They are decent quality and it's very convenient with the pump. They are a little tougher then regulation but I'm using them for an elementary school so they'll get worn in quick all in all a great purchase\n \n  I'm a teacher and kids are always losing the playground balls.  These were a great price and colors are vibrant.  They are good quality and have lasted my kids many days of play.  I really appreciate that it comes with a pump too.\n \n  My kids love playing with these ball especially for dodgeball battles they're not too hard  they're just right like the ones I play with when I was a kid.\n ", "\n  Used them a few times for playing dodgeball. They work awesome, they are slightly lighter than official dodgeballs so they don't hurt as much when you get hit in the head, but are harder to throw far. They seem to stay mostly round.\n \n  Ordered 2 sets of the playground balls for a program at work. They are the perfect size and will be great for our people. 1 of the 8 balls would not stay inflated. Contacted the company and they responded immediately and are replacing without any hassle. Will definately order from this comoany again.\n \n  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and ease of inflation.\n \n  Bought them for a school, going on 9 months and counting and still in good shape! Others brands kept popping, these don't!\n \n  As other reviews have stated, the balls are all different sizes. \n  Good size for younger kids.  Three year old can manage the ball.  Solid rubber and easy to fill with included pump.\n \n  My students love these for their kickball games at recess!\n \n  Great price,  perfect for playing 4 square and dodgeball!\n \n  colors and variety are great, the material has a bad chemical smell right out of the box. balls were damaged in a few weeks\n \n  This product states it comes with a pump.  There was no pump.\n ", "\n  These aren't as heavy as regular \"school grade\" kickballs, however they do nicely for backyard playing. Great price, however, two of the balls could not keep air. The pump broke soon after we bought these, but I'm not sure it was faulty product, or negligent kiddos!\n \n  They are okay one had a funny lump so it doesn't bounce right. Good for occasional use maybe not for everyday playground use.\n \n  Exactly as expected. Easy to inflate with the included air pump. Great bounce. Holds up well to kids and dogs\n \n  Only thing wrong which isn\u2019t THAT terribly bad, the balls aren\u2019t a normal sized ball they are a bit on the small side! But other then that my son hasn\u2019t complained and loves playing hand ball.\n \n  Nice quality. The air pump is really easy to use. Similar to the balls used in dodge ball.\n \n  I loved the variety of colors and the convenience of having a hand pump included.  But this product was purchased for very active 9 year old third graders.  They puncture easily and cannot be repaired.  Less competitive kids might enjoy these, but they don't stand up to the rigors of seriously active kids.\n \n  the balls are nice in that they bounce well but we blew up all 4 of them to maximum capacity and not a single one of them was anywhere close to 8.5 inches.\n \n  Exactly what I wanted. I bought these so my bird would stop fighting over them.\n \n  Great size and being used by the grandchildren in the gaga ball court  I think they will hold up for quite a while and the colors are very nice\n \n  Great for dodgeball for elementary school students! (Just remind them no head shots!!)\n ", "\n  Came with their own pump that a five year old was able to use independently.\n \n  Fairly pleased with the purchase. The balls are NOT all the same size. Buyer beware.\n \n  I bought these balls for my 1.5 yr old toddler who is obsessed with balls. These are perfect for playing at the park or playground. They are not too big for his little hands. They are great for tossing and kicking. Reasonably priced.....highly recommend.\n \n  My nephew love them because they are pretty much the same type that he gets to used at his school. It come with it's own air pump.\n \n  Perfect balls for all activities. I like how they come with a pump so you can make the balls small or large.\n \n  Nice, sturdy plastic. Fun colors. Went to retail shop to buy ball after our dog popped one, ended up ordering these due to price. Much stronger than more expensive balls already inflated at store.\n \n  My kids love these\n \n  Good balls for Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes!  Add dollar store pumps for the other ones in the box.  Cool balls!!!  love em\n \n  These are much smaller than the 8.5 inch diameter manufacturer says on the box. They are all under 8 inches.\n \n  My grandkids love these balls! It's perfect that you get for different colors, as they can all then have there own color and know which on I there ball! I have memories of playing with balls like this in school during recess. Kids now are so lucky they can have them at home!\n ", "\n  Terrible. Threw them out.\n \n  Can't go wrong with dodge balls!\n \n  I had arrived at a friend's house with her kids playing 4 square with a basketball that hurt all of our hands. So I got on Amazon and ordered these for our kids. Though a bit smaller than the balls we used for 4 square at recess back in our day, this is definitely a great purchase. It is so nice not having our hands hurt when we play now.\n \n  I bought these for elementary PE. The balls are a good size for children. They are very good for tossing, bouncing, and throwing. I plan on buying more for the school year. I won't recommend using them outside.\n \n  Cute good price . Didn't hold air well. Boght as Xmas gift for 6 year old\n \n  3 needles!\n \n  Purchased these for grandsons' birthdays.  Their mother said all their play balls \n  Perfect size balls to play with dodge balls, not too big and a little on the small side which is very nice.  None of mine came cracked like the others have said and we have had them in the cold garage\u200b for a couple months and still seem to be fine.\n \n  Great quality. Fun colors. My preschoolers use  on playground every day.\n \n  Grandkids loved them...said they were just like what they had at school.\n ", "\n  These work great if you are filling a shoebox for Samaritan's Purse Operation Christmas Child.  One of the most requested items are soccer balls and playground balls.  Since they come deflated, one will fit well inside a shoebox and still leave room for other items.  You can get packs of the pumps as well since this set only comes with one.\n \n  We play dodge ball with family and friends. Easy to use for kids but most of the time 20+ grown men are throwing them. They hold up well. Easy to inflate and deflate for storage.\n \n  These are great balls, they kick, bounce, throw.  They are just soft enough that our youngest grandson can catch them.  Our yard looks like a year round Easter egg hunt when our grandsons play with these balls.\n \n  My students love these balls for recess. Some use them to play a game of kickball, while others bounce them and play basketball style games. They hold air very well.\n \n  Only 2 of the four playground balls held air.  My kids were disappointed.  You get what you pay for.  Chicom garbage!!\n \n  good\n \n  A little smaller than I realized. Overall great quality. My students love them.\n \n  Everyone loves our playground balls. My kids love them for playing their version of handball.  Several friends have asked where we purchased.  Great price for a set of 4 with pump.\n \n  Love the bright colors\n \n  First feel is fine and as we just got them. They feel slightly more plastic than rubbery. Haven't played yet so we'll see how they hold up...\n ", "\n  We bought these as a donation to our kids preschool and they absolutely love them\n \n  My 2 yr old and neighbors love these. Big enough they don't go down the drains and so durable. They even fit my toddler basketball hoop which is perfect with all the kids each getting their own color no fighting \ud83d\ude03\n \n  Got these for my grandsons for Christmas.  They love them. Glad the pump is included because the balls do seem to lose a tiny bit of air over time.\n \n  Good bargain for the quality especially with the included air pump\n \n  Got these for 3 grand boys, They love them, haven't popped them even with the things they do with balls. Grandma's happy\n \n  Got this as favors for my sons dodgeball party. These are great. Pump worked just fine and came with extra needles.\n \n  Overall the balls were what expected, except one of them has an issue with the valve, making it impossible for it to stay inflated. So unfortunately I only got 3 functioning balls.\n \n  Red ball didn't hold any air.  Yellow ball deflated in 2 days.  Waste of money.  Unhappy children.\n \n  Wish they were slightly larger, but they seem to be good quality as my boys haven\u2019t managed to pop them yet.\n \n  My dog LOVES  these! He's a smaller dog, played with a good couple months before he popped, which wasn't loud and scary!\n ", "\n  I filled these to what I believe is a safe level without popping and measured, averaging 7.75 inches at most. Because I'm not using them for standard purposes and the kiddos I'm working with are 5-6 and have smaller hands, this will do nicely for me. If you're looking for standard 8.5 inch balls, however, you must look elsewhere. They feel relatively heavy and well constructed with minimal distortion (there is a small ridge around where the female needle port is and the PVC of the ball is joined to a harder semi-clear plastic. This may or may not affect bounce, but, again... for my needs, not a big deal.  I also am a teacher and doubt I'd use this for a rougher game like kickball. While the PVC is thick, I have seen balls of this quality pop easily under the forceful kick of a larger kid. In that case, I'd go with a branded ball at about twice the cost.\n \n  My kids love playing with them and they are lasting! Very easy to pump as well.\n \n  Kids love them.  Our last purchase of similar balls lasted about a year of heavy dodgeball and kickball in the streets\n \n  Good product. I was using them for working on treibball with my dog and they worked well. They do have a pretty pronounced middle however so sometimes bounce a little erratic.\n \n  Good, heavy duty rubber balls, as advertised, great price.  Easy to blow up with the included pump.  Very happy with this order.\n \n  The grandchildren loved these so much that we ordered a second set! Very durable!\n \n  play balls for the pool good value and pump included\n \n  Well made, reminds me of the four square balls I used on the playground back in the day.  My family has spent many hours playing with these!\n \n  Great balls\n \n  Kids love them. So does the dog.\n ", "\n  Nice and rubbery\n \n  They deflate every day.\n \n  Easy to do\n \n  OK CHOICE...\n \n  The rubber is thick and harder than expected.  After 3 uses, the pump broke.\n \n  Love these!  The kids have such fun.  Remind me of a slightly smaller version of the old playground balls.  Really appreciated getting these before Christmas!!\n \n  Inexpensive but durable.  These were a better quality than anticipated.  Held up for 25 teenage boys.  They are sturdy and the colors are great.  No fading yet.\n \n  Great value for 4 balls!  They were a little smaller than I expected, so read the dimensions, but that didn't bother my kids - they were very excited about the balls and to have extra to take to school.\n \n  Balls are fine and I appreciated the extra needles to pump them up. However, the pump broke while pumping up the second ball.\n \n  Great to play handball.\n ", "\n  Do not work for silver sneakers class. Balls are hard to grip.\n \n  Great for school playground\n \n  Perfect for Four Square or to just toss around. We've had them for a few weeks now and they've kept their air. Very impressed with these balls, especially because of the reasonable price.\n \n  These balls are a great size. Our grandkids ages one to 9 all have fun with them. The one year old can hold the balls easily and the older kids play foursquare with them.  The hand pump worked well so the balls were easy to inflate. Good buy!\n \n  Excellent, no issues.\n \n  Good quality for the price\n \n  This was a gift to my grandson's first grade classroom.  He loves it.  Excellent service.\n \n  Fair price for the balls -  they are a hard rubber and come deflated.  A hand pump and 3 needles are thrown in for easy inflation.  However, once inflated, they still have a seam and any time the ball lands on that seam, it bounces crazy.  The balls don't end up being perfectly round, more like round with a bump across the equator which leads to the odd bounces.\n \n  Easy to inflant and durable and fun\n \n  Such a great price!  The balls were a nice size.  Perfect for four square and dodge ball.  The balls and pump have held up well in our house with four kiddos.\n ", "\n  Inflated the balls but two of them bounce wrong and go off to the side\n \n  Amazing balls! Very colorful and the kind day (ages 2-3) love them!!!! The pump is wonderful. I was able to fill my other balls with it!\n \n  Took these to Honduras for the Senior Program.  They were easy to inflate and perfect size.\n \n  Great balls for price- pump included\n \n  The hand pump was very convenient and the quality of the balls is pretty decent although they deflate a little over time you can pump it back to a nice round shape again. Play all the time with a group of friends and family and always have a good time\n \n  Bought for a special project from Pinterest  Will be made into oversized bulbs for a large tree in the front yard.\n \n  The balls were not even 8.5 inches nor did they roll properly. I would like a replacement if the balls are not supposed to be like this.\n \n  Sent these to our daughter who teaches abroad for her students.\n \n  Great kick balls\n \n  One of the balls had a leak, but overall my grandson enjoyed them\n ", "\n  My order came in today. I examined all the dodgeballs and found no fault with them so far. I have not inflated them just yet. I will update this review after I try the pump to inflate.\n \n  Nice playground balls - kids love them.- seller did a great job of getting them to me quickly, I would recommend this seller to others.\n \n  great!\n \n  Very impressed with the ball, came boxed and inflated and 9 days earlier than the estimated delivery date which in my eyes is a bonus. The balance has great grip and have tested it out tonight and was perfect,\n \n  Great for dodgeball. Perfect size for kids\n \n  Love! Perfect gift for 2 year old obsessed with kicking playground balls\n \n  USED WITH MY 'THE VITALIZER' BOUGHT ALSO ON AMAZON.

He loves them!\n \n  these are very small.  and very cheap. low quality. sad\n \n  A+\n ", "\n  My grandson loved them! Just what I was looking for\n \n  Not a 8.5inch ball very disappointed in the false advertisement\n \n  Good quality, soft but durable. Easy to fill with pump that comes with the balls. Bouncy and fun to throw and kick\n \n  Ball works great for the kids. Slight negative was that the ball was too small and if we pumped it up make stretch the ball to a larger size, the feel of the ball was too hard and not as bouncy.\n \n  Great value! My boys love these balls, especially for playing kickball.\n \n  Tiny, round and not what I expected.\n \n  Daughter loved these! Great value for the quality.\n \n  Great quality for the price.  I included these in my Operation Christmas Child box.  My children kept one and it's a great, sturdy ball for the price.\n \n  3 out of the 4 balls are great, but one will not hold air. It leaks from the air hole. Also, these are much smaller than a typical kick ball, but my kids are enjoying them.\n \n  Bought these to donate to a local school.  No complaints.\n ", "\n  Just okay. Smaller than expected and not thick rubber, but they work. \n  Fun little playground balls.  We used them for our Inside Out costume. They were easy to inflate with the quality air pump provided in the ball set.  The only difficulty is a bulldog got ahold of the green ball and the bulldog won (keep away from pets!).  Good purchase.\n \n  I loved the ease of inflating these bright balls.  Unfortunately one of them is a little wonky. (not perfectly round)  But it still bounces alright.\n \n  Kids LOVE them\n \n  Blew them up a few months ago still going strong.\n \n  Package came without the pump which is supposed to be part of the package.\n \n  Had to return\n \n  These playground balls are nice quality for the money.

Will use this for party favors and very easy to inflate !\n \n  These balls are just okay. I was looking for the classic flubber type balls for my 5-7 year old kids. These are more plastic like than rubber and are definitely on the small side.\n \n  Very little rubber used - feels like more of a plastic mix, and doesn't bounce well.\n ", "\n  You certainly get what you pay for. \n  Seems to work well. I CrossFit and do heavy lifting so inflammation of my joints is common. I have found relief since adding the turmeric. \n  Very good deal for this set of balls. I ordered them to use in Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes and they will make a kid super happy one day!  Happy with this purchase!\n \n  These are very hard, not soft and rubbery. One of them did not hold air.\n \n  Bought them to use in school. Great balls! Well made. Kids really like them.\n \n  The price was very reasonable and they seem like they will last awhile.\n \n  These were fine. Smaller than the typical playground balls, but they worked out. One of them had a hole and didn't pump up (after several attempts over several days), but the other 3 were fine, so for the price it worked out o.k.\n \n  I love these balls. I got them for my grandchildren to play with when they visit. They have maintained their air pressure and are brightly colorful, easily held balls that are great for kicking and throwing. They are made from a durable rubber with texture and hold up better than the pharmacy store version of bouncy balls.\n \n  yay\n \n  Football failed to hold pressure even after purchasing a separate sealant it still won't hold pressure so I have to order my grandson a new one\n ", "\n  I ordered these for a game I'm making. I needed some balls that where colorful, durable, and the right size. This set (I actually bought two sets) exceeded my expectations. I'm puzzled by the reviewers who said the balls where smaller than they anticipated. What part of \"8.5 inches\" confused you? Some said they where not durable. I inflated them as soon as I got them, and after a few weeks of use, they did not lose any air and they still where in excellent condition. As for the colors, they are much more vibrant than the photos make them appear. My intention is to purchase more of these. Good price for a good product.\n \n  These balls are great! Our balls were all the same sizes so not sure what happened with other reviewers orders. Pump that comes with it is great and easy to use. We'll get a lot of use out of these!\n \n  Great balls, love the colors\n \n  the kids loved these for Christmas and loved how they were able to air them up all by themselves - they love playing ball and with friends over having several balls is always best\n \n  These playground balls are well made and durable. My 4 children love them, especially my 8 year old uses them for handball!\n \n  These are good construction. But mine all came a different size. Maybe I missed that part. But they are all a different size.\n \n  All the balls are brand new and good quality. Only issue is that the blue ball is about an inch or so smaller than the rest when fully inflated.\n \n  Fun, good quality playground balls! We provided them as birthday party favors, and everyone enjoyed them. It was nice that it also came with a ball pump.\n \n  Love these. My friends and I have a blast playing kickball with them. They are more of a Dodge ball but they work for kick ball\n \n  Bought two packages of these and they work great.  More air and the larger it gets.  Dodgeball, warball, kickball or just anything using balls these work great.\n ", "\n  This was a great deal for 4 balls.  At first I thought it was just 1 color but you get the full set of 4.  Good size and the hand pump actually works - not like some of the cheesy ones that break.\n \n  Much better than I expected.  They have held up really well\n \n  These are great, we played dodge ball for hours. No issues, easy to pump up and the pump works well. I highly recommend them.\n \n  I like to throw these at my neighbor in the morning when he isn't looking, what a sucker HA!\n \n  Wow have these as a gift. Perfect for my son.\n \n  Thanks.\n \n  My grandchildren not only love the balls, but they loved being able to inflate them themselves.\n \n  good quality\n \n  Great size great set for my for grandkids. Each one gets their own color!\n \n  Awesome, just what I needed!\n ", "\n  Good.\n \n  Perfect size for dodgeball\n \n  very nice ball buy ittt\n \n  Juegos de grupo\n None \n  Great balls to use for children's games! I will say I am one that always defends the description of a product when reviewers complain about something obviously stated in the description. However, the photo is a bit deceptive. The description clearly states 8.5 inches, but the small box and small air pump had me expecting something different. When I saw the inflated balls, I actually asked where the ones I bought were. They were just so much smaller than I had imagined (with the help of the deceptive photo). \n  I brought these originally to use as dodgeballs as my 7 year old is interested in it, they arrive deflated but come with a pump and nozzle so easy enough to inflate. \n  This pack of 4 training balls is a great deal. The material is thick enough to be durable for outside use, but they are safe enough to use indoors. These make great dodgeballs at a fraction of the cost of \"official\" dodgeball or volleyballs. Package includes pump which works!\n \n  Love these balls they're like school balls tough but not hard to hurt .Colours are bright and makes it easy to see.We been using them for basketball perfect ball for anything really .An all rounder ball .\n \n  Great set of balls. They are soft enough to used indoors but best in the garden. They come with the handy pump which I've already used for different things like the garden swimming pool\n \n  Value for money and they come with a decent ball pump. Great for youngsters, good quality rubber with a pattern for grip. Very happy with this purchase.\n ", "\n  was amazed at the price when usually just one over \u00a310 and when it came was really happy the quality was great\n \n  Bought these to learn to head bounce and juggle, they area  great size, the rubber is soft and grippy. However after inflating and deflating the ball a dozen times (its too large to fit in my bag with my other props) the seal on the valve started to go. I remedied that with some silicone sealant and now its permanently inflated.\n \n  Good quality, beautiful colors, and nice price. Playground or indoor fun for young children.\n \n  Great set of playground balls, pump was good, once pumped up stays inflated.\n \n  Just the thing for helping my 5 year old learn to catch, kick etc.  They are nice and bright, bounce well, not too heavy and slightly textured therefore easier to catch.  He has the red one at the moment and he loves it.  Only criticism would be that they don't quite roll straight due to being more weighted where the pump goes in.  Otherwise perfect.\n \n  These balls are very colourful and easy to grip and very bouncey.I ordered 24 all told and only one was faulty so not too bad. For every four balls there is a pump so I now have six pumps !\n \n  Great product.\n \n  Bought these for my 19 month old daughter. Super fast delivery and really easy to pump up. Fantastic that the balls came either a pump and also several attachments. Really happy with this purchase and may buy some for the playgroup where I work :)\n \n  These are great. i run a Guide unit and we use them for dodge ball all the time\n \n  \ud83d\udc4c\n ", "\n  Amazing\n \n  Love them but they raised their price 24 hours later after I shared link with friends. Think that is pretty sucky\n \n  Nice, soft sought for children. Easy to grip.\n \n  Way better than expected.\n \n  Good quality balls with textured exterior making it easier for children to grab hold of it. The hand pump is also great.\n \n  Very good and delivered on time.\n \n  Really strong shells - great value.\n \n  Brilliant quality\n \n  Versatile balls that are surprisingly good quality for the price paid\n \n  Lovely garden balls and great pump\n ", "\n  Well made and with pump included so easy to blow up\n \n  Good playground balls for kids.\n \n  Wrong size\n \n  Great value, the balls are good quality.\n \n  A really great product! The kids love them!! Great for indoor play.\n \n  Decent quality and yes you do have four nice colors\u2026 There is a weird seam going through these balls so they are not perfectly round even when you blow them up not bad for the price and her kids have fun with them and they do bounce  good gripping texture to them as well\u2026 Nice and bright idea for smaller hands\u2026 Perfect for kids five years old to 10 years old but if you\u2019re looking for the classic foursquare ball or dodgeball this one is just a little smaller than you would expect  W\n \n  At first out of the box we were happy with the balls. But after pumping them up and using the red one 3 times it got a slow leak. Examining the ball I found a tiny pin hole size leak where the rubber of the ball was weak. Looking over the ball I found other \"air bubbles\" in the rubber where air pockets had been trapped in the mold and the ball didnt get the full thickness of rubber in those spots. Buy with caution.\n \n  I bought these for my 9 year old son to take to school to play four square with his friends at recess, they had been using a regular soccer ball that constantly deflated because it was bounced so hard. This was a great buy! The material feels sturdy, they have a nice grippy texture and are very lightweight but have fantastic bounce to them. The included pump worked perfect and they were very easy and fast to inflate, no leaks in any of them so far. Both he and my 3.5 year old son love them, I can tell they will get plenty of use, I would buy again!\n \n  Bought these for my daughter. I figure it\u2019s never too early to learn the highs and lows of a good dodgeball game! These are just like the ones we had in elementary school. And fun colours.\n \n  Good quality balls... My kids love them.. a bit heavy and hard... I chose this one because it came with the pump and to my surprise the pump came with 3 pins... So glad I chose this set.\n ", "\n  The balls are great and the hand pump is so useful for any ball. Just note that the balls are too heavy for kids of under 5 years old.\n \n  No air leaks in ant of the ball. Very good bounce. Make of strong rubber.\n \n  Used for dodgeball party. The kids  had a blast!\n \n  I didn\u2019t expect much for the great price, but man this is excellent\n \n  Bonne qualit\u00e9, plus petit donc id\u00e9al pour les enfants. bien contente de notre achat.\n None \n  Belle qualit\u00e9\n None \n  Beau bon pas cher \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n None \n  I like it because you can play a lot of sports for example you can play dodgeball\n \n  Comes with a pump and all the balls work great.\n \n  Great - as described.\n ", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}, "/GoSports-Official-Kickball-Pump-Pack/product-review/B01G3J3238/ref=sxin_9?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.cabc794f-b735-4ff3-b261-5880a69930fb.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B01G3J3238&cv_ct_cx=ball&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.cabc794f-b735-4ff3-b261-5880a69930fb.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-gl-ranking&dchild=1&keywords=ball&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B01G3J3238&pd_rd_r=c6bee1f2-a28f-4a64-ad43-933ac9e8fb5f&pd_rd_w=YDKm4&pd_rd_wg=WHriX&pf_rd_p=26c7e498-3189-4918-a321-ec25e32964ce&pf_rd_r=QM7CQJERBRTY0GSBQV72&qid=1603712721&sr=1-1-d9dc7690-f7e1-44eb-ad06-aebbef559a37&tag=fnonsite-20": {"Product Info": {"Bullets": ["OUTDOOR FUN: Includes 2 official 10 inch kickballs with textured surface", "AIR RETENTION: Includes premium pump to ensure balls are ALWAYS at the correct psi", "GRIP SURFACE: Classic red balls with stipple finish for added grip", "TOUGH: Perfect for kickball leagues, schools, camps, gyms and home use - for all ages", "PLAYGROUND GAMES: Can also be used for other activities such as four square, handball and more", "#4 in"], "Product Description": ""}, "Reviews": ["\n  Let me start by saying these aren't your typical thin Walmart brand cheap balls. They are thick and durable and the size is just right. Some complain and say they are small but they are regulation size and they are built nicely. It was nice being able to open the box up and use the pump to air them up and get right into the game. In the Army playing a sport is a luxury and once we played kickball the other units were asking to borrow the equipment so they could play too. I am throughly pleased with the company and my purchase and will definitely be buying more sports equipment from them in the future.\n \n  These lasted two years with light use (mostly 4-square).  They may have been used a dozen times (if even that much) over the course of the year.  Similar to with the WAKA kickball I bought before these, it developed a pinhole and leaked.  Perhaps these would have better durability if used for kickball, but for 4-square in the street, they do not seem to have the best durability.  I will continue my search for a longer lasting 4-square ball.\n \n  balls seem like a good product, but when my 7 year old grandson opened his gift up, there was no pump. he was pretty disappointed. I hope the company will do right by this.  company will not send a pump unless i take a picture of the balls that do not have the pump and include a copy of the amazon receipt.  i will have to return the balls and reorder them. \n  Very impressed with the two kickball's I ordered.  I received them within a week of ordering them.  I was skeptical of the pump included with them but was pleasantly surprised by it.  It only took a couple of minutes to blow the ball up and worked very well. \n  These are heavy duty kick balls. We leave them in the backyard and they don't loose any air. They are awesome to kick around with the kids. They are easy to inflate and don't pop easy.\n \n  A lot of people talked about the ball cracking, being dry and splitting. I bought 2 of these and they are perfect.No football shapes either or wobblies. The air pump with nozzle in the handle was a pleasure. It includes a flex hose too. Now you don't have to worry about breaking the air nozzle in the ball, a real added bonus. I keep them indoors after use to prevent the drying and my kids are having a BALL! I am purchasing more to donate to their school. Was a timely shipment well packaged too.\n \n  Got these for my son's birthday party -- 8 year old boys used them for an impromptu kickball game, soccer, etc. Like they it came with 2 and also a hand pump. Easy to inflate, took less than 5 minutes.\n \n  I purchased the 10\" kickballs with pump for gifts to send overseas. One ball each was sent to a boy and a girl age 10-14. (Since only one pump was included with the two balls. I bought another pump.) I gave 4 stars because the balls haven't been used yet, but they seem to be what I expected. The shipping was fast and I received the total order in good condition.\n \n  These are not the normal 10\" kickballs. They are smaller than normal. \n  Great value! My son loves them. He got them for his first Christmas and he likes to roll them. Hopefully they will be fun to kick around later too. I like how it comes with 2 so we can have one for inside and one for outside. Or just save the second for when the first one gets lost.\n ", "\n  The balls are OK to practice with, but beware, they are softer than adult league balls and although throwing and catching techniques can be improved by practice with them, they are too soft for legit catching and kicking.\n \n  These are our \"go to balls\" on the kindergarten playground and have lasted since November 2018 and are still going strong!\n \n  This is exactly what you expect to get when you order a kickball. What I did really like was that the pump that came with it has a space in the handle to hold the needle. So it will not get lost. Thumps up!\n \n  One was lopsided and no matter how much air we put, it wouldn\u2019t go round. Aside from that, they\u2019re hard to throw and seem to be larger than I ever remember playing with before. But it\u2019s been a while I suppose. Held up with very strong men kicking.\n \n  These were definitely true to standard kickball sized. We bought these for family kickball at the neighborhood park, and this ball was just too big and tough for the little kids. We used the playground balls instead. Great for older kids and adults, but not younger kids.\n \n  Exactly what I needed for family kickball!\n \n  We have really been loving this kickball. It is incredibly easy to inflate and use. You're ready to go in about 60 seconds after you get it out of the box. \"It's really good overall. It's really bouncy,\" says my kid. It does seem to lose a little of its air more quickly than we were expecting, but pumping it up before we play is super simple, so it's not a detraction from use or enjoyment.\n \n  I bought these for our employee kickball tournament.  They worked out just fine, but were smaller than expected.  For the price, definitely not a bad buy, especially since they came with the pump.\n \n  I ordered the two-pack + hand pump edition of your 10\" Kickballs. This is a spectacularly good product. Easy to inflate with the enclosed pump. Fine quality. The balls perform exceedingly well for the price point. I have not yet used them for a long enough period to evaluate their durability: but they seem superbly fit for amateur play, and likely to survive children's treatments!\n \n  Easy to pump up and easy for young kids to kick around.\n ", "\n  Kids had fun with these - my husband said they are good quality, sort of like the ones you play with in school.\n \n  great kick balls.  The material seems thick and pliable. The material reminds me of the quality stuff like when I was a kid.  So far, they are holding up quite well.  Much better than a couple other types of 'cheaper' kickball I've bought.\n \n  These are sturdy playground balls - the kids were able to pump them up on their own (7 year old triplets). Couldn't be happier with this purchase!  We live next to a huge park and now we have our own kickballs - fun for the kids and great exercise for me.\n \n  Nice Kickballs.  Just like I remember from school.\n \n  I was wicked excited about this deal! I bought to use at my children's birthday party, but it didn't come with a needle to inflate the balls. I know I can get a new complete pump, but at that time I was crunched for having it then and there. I think quality of balls is pretty good, but have not used them yet. We will be using them in dryland for our swim team.\n \n  Our sports loving 11 year old girl loved them.\n \n  I got 2 balls and the  pump, easy to use, ready in minutes. We played outside for hours. They balls  bounce really high and definitely worth every penny.\n \n  Great fun for family\n \n  Love it!  Just a classic old school rubber gym ball.  Easy to inflate, excellent bounce and a great way to get a little exercise during quarantine without leaving your own yard.  Two square, soccer, dribbling, or just an informal game of kick around.\n \n  Seems like the official kickball I remember as a kid.  My grandsons (ages 8 and 10) love these and certainly use them to their fullest!  Seem great so far.  Came very quickly, easy to inflate, and very durable.  Great product and great price!\n ", "\n  Worked great a little smaller than expected but loved them nonetheless. \n  Good quality\n \n  I loved this set.  Easy to blow up with included pump, an extra ball for backup if other was punctured.  Has provided hours of fun and great exercise.\n \n  I filled them up to the right size and one looks lopsided and one keeps getting smaller. I can't return because of course I used them but they don't look like the brand ones and no one trust their quality. I wish I would of known that!\n \n  Exactly what you would expect when you see the photo of the two kickballs. The same red and they are exactly what you need for your kickball game. \n  I ordered this so my daughter could practice pitching and kicking for her organized kickball league. This is not the \"official\" kickball used in CYO Indianapolis. The balls are great, don't get me wrong. We kept them to play with in the neighborhood for dodgeball or goofing off. However, the \"official\" kickball used in CYO sports is https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017PDU4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n \n  Kids love them\n \n  I ordered two kickballs for my grandchildren. They\u2019re perfect for dodgeball, kickball and all sorts of fun. The pump included was awesome, and it includes a compartment with another needle, which is cool too. I haven\u2019t played with a rubber ball since childhood, this has been great!\n \n  These are decent quality and durable balls for kickball. They are perhaps a bit hard for young kids so keep that in mind when purchasing. They weren\u2019t too bad to inflate but you might want to use a better pump if you have one.\n \n  I ordered this set for our Kindergarten classes. One came with a superficial cut. The company responded promptly and sent me another ball. Our students have been using them for just a week and they seem to be holding up great. They are very sturdy and having the small, handy pump will save the hassle of bringing them home to inflate.\n ", "\n  The balls came un/deflated but it took literally less than 2 minutes to blow up. I'm glad they did now - I can keep one stored much easier until I need it and I can keep this great pump with me for this ball or any others. Was definitely worth the price.\n \n  I researched before buying this kickball because it was for a group of adults as well as some kids, so it needed to hold up to the abuse that certain Men would put it through! It definitely lived up to the praise it got! I purchased 2, and I'm going to donate 1 to the youth at church, it will work real well for playing 4-square and other games as well. I also liked that they included a small pump, and it took no time to blow them up. You can't go wrong with the price either.\n \n  Good balls.  I used my pump so I cant speak to that. Four stars because of the chemical smell.  I had them indoors before taking them outside, and the smell filled the room.\n \n  Came with everything needed to inflate!\n \n  These are made of very thick rubber, like the ones I remember from when I was a kid.  I went with this set because it came with the pump.  Already have a pump, but this one is small and you can take it with you to the park!  The needle stores in the handle for added convenience.  I think these will stand up to the tough boy challenge!\n \n  Great product\n \n  My kid loved it!\n \n  The thing is I mostly bought this ball to be used by my grandson and a lot of the time will be indoors. I\u2019m very particular about smells. Unfortunately this bar smells like One of those plastic new shower curtains!\u2026 I tried to find natural rubber but it\u2019s very hard to find.\n \n  I bought these for an aduktnaports league that I run.  The 2 balls and pump are a great value, but they lose their shape quickly and get warped. Maybe for kids it would hold stronger, but adults it only lasted a few games.\n \n  Works right for the purpose I need it.\n ", "\n  This set was a hit at my family reunion. The balls were easy to inflate and held up to fairly rough play.\n \n  The football and kickballs are exactly what we were looking for and are very high quality. We had an issue with one of the kickballs when it arrived, and the customer service was incredible! They were immediately responsive, very understanding, and worked quickly to resolve the issue. A great company and we will be supporting them again in the future!\n \n  These are really good quality kickball and the real deal. The bonus added pump is great to take with you on the field but not what I would use on a regular basis as it is not the easiest to pump because of how small it is.\n \n  My grandsons play with these almost everyday after school.  So, apparently, they are well made and sturdy balls.\n \n  These are two very good kick balls. They are solid, well made, and hold up well against tough pressure (they do not turn into that weird egg shape). The pump that comes with them inflates really fast and I use it for all of my sports equipment needs. I am very satisfied with this purchase and love being able to take these kick balls outside and play a whole slew of games with them. I also like the grippy outside of the ball, you can always tell those are the more quality of these type of red sport balls.\n \n  We ordered another dodge ball and it was tiny so we got these as a replacement for a Christmas present. It's nice that it came with a pump and my son has enjoyed it so far (despite the snow). \n  I bought these balls for my son to play 4 square and bounce against the wall.  Within two months they cracked and punctured.  The balls I by from Walmart for under $5 last longer than that.\n \n  Very durable. 20+ kids in the neighborhood...has with stood much abuse. Still going strong.\n \n  Got it for my kids to play with. They loved it until a week last and it deflated. Tried pumping air back into it but nope!  Sad that my kids are asking to play with it but it is cheap.\n \n  Got these for our schools PE teacher. Great value.\n ", "\n  I Bought these to play kickball with my coworkers.  The balls are extremely well build and durable.  We played for over 3 hours the first day and had no issues with the balls. \n  Purchased these for our grandkids.  Wanted something that wasn't going to pop and had a nice bounce to it.  Have had them for a month,  they seem strong and don't loose air fast since we play kickball, tag or just catch.  I would  recommend these kickballs for several reasons, durability, price and the pump.\n \n  The package came with two kickballs and a pump (needle included in handle of the pump). So far we have only played one game, but the ball held up great. We were kicking it around for over 4 hrs and it held its air no problem. \n  Great quality! Reminds me of the kick balls from school.\n \n  Very good quality red rubber kickballs. It was convenient to buy the \"two pack\" that came with a pump and needle. Made of thick textured red rubber like they used to be when i was a kid. GoSports also donates balls to charity for every unbiased review posted. That is great, thanks.\n \n  Ordered these to donate to my daughters 3rd grade classroom. These are fabulous balls, the kids loved them. I really liked that they have a hand pump for the teacher to easily add air to the balls when needed.\n \n  The balls are fine but the package arrived without the hand pump. It's fine because we have a bicycle pump with the correct attachment to inflate these balls but it's annoying that we paid for something we didn't receive.\n \n  My kids love to play outside alot so decided to purchase these kick balls for them I remember growing up back in elementary I always wanted to take home the red hand ball that what we would call them and now my kids get to have there own ones just for them love that it comes with the pump and extra needles\n \n  I am using these for informal Dodge Ball games in the backyard.  These are the Heavy Duty ones we used in Middle School back in the day!  Perfect!  Great product and will hold up for many years to come!\n \n  Classic kick balls\n ", "\n  Terrific quality product to play kick ball, dodge ball, etc with the grandchildren and get them outside\n \n  Super happy with my purchase. Spend more time with my younger siblings at the park. Also happy to hear you guys supply boys and girls club and  I have the best memories at boys and girls clubs\n \n  Bought it for our family kickball tournament. Great quality!\n \n  Bought these for a family kickball game. They worked well for all ages.\n \n  Great quality balls and my kids love them!  The first package was packed incorrectly and the needle poked right through the rubber when we went to inflate it.  Go Sports sent us a new package immediately.  Bravo!!  Great customer service!!\n \n  I got this set for an adult kickball league I'm a part of. The product was as described with two kickballs and the pump. We've gotten pretty good use out of the kickballs without the need to add air. Plus it is always handy having a second kickball. I recommend this to anyone who is in need of a kickball.\n \n  I purchased these for my grandsons and they really like them a lot. they seem to be of good quality.\n \n  The kick balls were top notch, heavy rubber material, regulation size. The added pump was of good quality and made the inflation process so easy.  I had a question and the customer service department answered quickly and throughly. Highly recommend.\n \n  These are thick and wonderful just like the ones you remember from school.  Kids love them!\n \n  Our students go through kickballs like crazy! The quailty of the GoSports Kickball bal w/ pump, far surpasses the other kickballs we have used in the past. I will definitely be ordering this again, as well as other sports products that they sell. ", "\n  Two flat balls with no pump in box! Please send me a pump.\n \n  Works great!\n \n  These arrived well packaged. It's nice yo have a second/backup ball. It was easy to pump and good quality rubber. My friends and I had a blast playing kickball!\n \n  The balls are made of durable rubber, good quality roundness. The pump is decent and the needle stores nicely in the handle. I Would definitely buy again, and would definitely recommend these to a friend.\n \n  These are really heavy duty rubber balls like I remember playing dodgeball with in the 70-80s.\n \n  Great product. This is the 2nd set I have ordered for my class.\n \n  These balls are of great quality. The rubber is thick and eliminated our fear of the balls popping. We had a blast playing kickball with them and look forward to future use. The pump is very handy and has a nice place built in to store the needle.

The full color glossy sheet included in the box clearly states that the needle is inside the pump handle. That's where my needle was. Great product, great price.\n \n  The balls are great quality, but they're not 10\" balls. I play kickball with a kickball league and they don't meet the standards.\n \n  These were delivered yesterday and both are broken today.

Defiantly holds up to the wacks they take.  The pump is convenient.  The storage of the needle in the handle is a nice addition so that it will not be lost.  The kickballs and pump are well priced for what you get!\n \n  This product would've received 5 stars from me if they included the needle to pump up the balls.  What good is deflated kickballs with a pump, that don't include the needle.\n \n  Balls are good but didn't include a pump needle.  Makes the pump worthless.\n \n  Great quality.\n \n  Used for practice for our kickball team.

Ever hear of the phrase \"balls to the walls\"? Yeah, well these balls can take the walls, and more. I used these balls in a warehouse with sharp metal racking and it kept bouncing back and asking for more abuse. I LOVE THIS PUMP. I've never gotten a pump get a pair of balls so hard in my whole life. I wet the tip a little bit and slowly jammed it in the hole and it slid right in. It did take some brute force but my kickballs were perfect. I would absolutely buy another pair of these GoSports Offical Kickballs if mine ever pop.\n \n  I've purchased kickballs several times and my biggest complaint is that they warp and burst too easily and are difficult to grip. As soon as I opened the box, I knew that I had made the right decision to buy the GoSports kickballs. I immediately noticed how thick and easy to grip they are. They inflated easily (the needle stored in the pump handle is a nice touch). Can't wait for the start of the new season!\n \n  Our school purchased these to use as 4 sq balls.  The balls were simple to air up although not a huge fan of the pump, but it did the job.  Rubber was sturdy and feels like it will last. Performed as described.  The 10 inch is more of a kickball size not 4 sq, but that was on us for misjudging the needed size.\n \n  No pin included with pump.\n ", "\n  Was giving this as a gift and it DID NOT come packaged as picture showed.  Balls were deflated.  Since it was a gift for charity, we were told not to wrap it for angel tree giving and I was very embarrassed that it looked so cheap.\n \n  I already love this product. I bought these for my classroom. The kids love playing kickball! The balls stay inflated, and have excellent bounce. They were easy to pump up, and the pump that is in included is good quality. The only part I didn't like was that the bases came with a greasy film on them, but with a quick wash it was gone and I was able to write my name on them.\n \n  We hold 4-Square games all the time at for our afterschool teen and tween programs at our library. We have had a hard time getting a good kickball, but this set does the job! I loved that it came with its own pump and needle and that there were two balls in the kit. Having more than one means if we need to patch the other, we can still play our games. Great value for a great kit!\n \n  This set is awesome!  Very high quality and the kids have been enjoying immensely.  Whether kicking, throwing, or even spinning on a finger, this set is loads of fun.  I love that balls encourage movement and fun and GoSports has a great duo here.  Plus, I love that the pump is included so we can always make sure they are full!\n \n  We purchased this product through our business account for a company event. While inflating one of the kickballs, it popped--after writing a review on GoSports' Facebook page and emailing them about it, they have offered to replace the ball! Great Customer Service as well as quality of ball (one that did not pop haha). Will definitely continue to order from GoSports.\n \n  These are very heavy duty and made of thick rubber. They inflated very easily with the included pump. There were no holes or rips and very high quality. They bounce really well and don't seem to sting to badly when hit. \n  These balls are the absolute best. Very durable and kid friendly. Plus the price for two is great!\n \n  Balls are of a great quality.  The pump could use better instructions.  The balls inflated easily and it appears they will withstand many tournaments.  I am very satisfied.  Great price.\n \n  Works great for 4 square and kickball\n \n  We celebrated the end of our Recreational baseball season with games.

The kids love them and they are so easy to pump up.  I recommend this product.\n \n  The pump did not come with the balls. So now I need to buy a pump and spend more money.\n \n  The balls popped after a few games.\n \n  Terrain is rough where kids play and they did not last long wore out not really for excessive use of 5 kids\n \n  Ball one was punctured the same day kicking it around on grass. \n  So happy these balls arrived, and within two days of my placing the order. They come in plastic bags, protected by the box. Case contains pump, needle, and an extra needle in the handle, so don't lose that one by accident. Very excited to play soccer-baseball with these!
